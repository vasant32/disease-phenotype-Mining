Certain components of apples have been shown to prevent cancer growth and impede cancer progression. We hypothesized that extracted apple polysaccharides (APs) might, therefore, have anticancer effects, through a mechanism involving the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, partly via the NF-κB pathway. Two human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, HT-29 and SW620, were exposed to different concentrations of APs (0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/ml). Cell apoptosis was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay by flow cytometry and incorporation of 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into DNA to identify the proliferating cell fraction, using fluorescence microscopy in vitro. The protein levels of NF-κB/p65, I-κBα, pI-κBα, Bax, Bcl-xl and Bcl-2 were evaluated by western blotting. The target sites of APs on CRC cells were assessed by flow cytometry. At concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mg/ml, APs showed apoptosis-inducing effects, increased expressions of Bax, nuclear p65 and cytoplasmic pI-κBα, and decreased expressions of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and cytoplasmic I-κBα. APs induced apoptosis by slightly activating the NF-κB pathway; the AP target site could be the Toll-like receptor 4 on the cell membrane. These results demonstrate the potential of APs as agents for clinical prevention and treatment of CRC.
