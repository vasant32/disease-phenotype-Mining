In response to concern about lengthy waiting times for cancer treatment in the UK, the Department of Health introduced 'the colorectal cancer target referral scheme' to improve the referral process for suspected cancer. A user-centred web-based intranet software was developed reflecting the core work of the multi-disciplinary cancer team and the patient journey. The method used was primarily based on the concept of involving the end users (clinicians, nurses, administration staff) in the process of problem definition, software design, formative evaluation, development and implementation, from the very beginning, to ensure its relevance, functionality, and effectiveness. This software improved the interdisciplinary communication among doctors. All patients met the government waiting targets and proved to be a facilitative tool for audit, research and further prospective assessment of our service. Implementing a functional software design is mandatory for the management of target referral patients.
