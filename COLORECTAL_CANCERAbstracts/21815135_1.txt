 BACKGROUND: The authors chose to examine the association between body mass index (BMI) and incident colorectal cancer across the spectrum of BMI, including underweight persons, because detailed prospective cohort data on this topic in Asians is scarce, as is data on underweight persons (BMI, <18.5 kg/m(2)) in any population. METHODS: Analysis of the Singapore Chinese Health Study included 51,251 men and women aged 45-74 years enrolled in 1993-1998 and followed through 2007. Incident cancer cases and deaths among cohort members were identified through record linkage, and 980 cases were identified. Cox regression models were used to investigate the association of baseline BMI with risk of incident colorectal cancer during a mean of 11.5 years of follow-up. RESULTS: A significant, U-shaped, quadratic association was observed between BMI and colon cancer risk, with increased risk in BMIs ≥27.5 and <18.5 kg/m(2). The association was more pronounced in never smokers and most prominent when further limiting the sample to those free of diabetes and cases with longer than 5 years of follow-up. Localized cases had a more pronounced association in BMIs ≥27.5, whereas advanced cases had a more pronounced association in BMIs <18.5 kg/m(2) . No association was found in relation to rectal cancer risk. The association was also stronger among patients aged 65 years and older. CONCLUSIONS: BMI displays a U-shaped, quadratic association with colon cancer risk in this Chinese population in Southeast Asia.
