 PURPOSE: Limited data are available regarding the efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of oxaliplatin in patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the results of HAI of oxaliplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with such metastases. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 22 CRC patients treated with HAI of combination of oxaliplatin and 5-FU and LV was performed. RESULTS: Partial response (PR) was observed in 4 (18%) patients and stable disease (SD) in 7, with an overall disease control rate of 50%. The median progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7 and 11 months, respectively. Two patients treated with first-line treatment underwent subsequent liver resection. In 2 patients, HAI of oxaliplatin, 5-FU and LV was combined with systemic administration of bevacizumab. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate reasonable efficacy of HAI with oxaliplatin, 5-FU and LV in patients with liver metastases from CRC.
