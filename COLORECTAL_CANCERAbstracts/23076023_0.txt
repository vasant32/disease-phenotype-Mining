 BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the impact of adjuvant systemic therapy with modern chemotherapy combinations on survival outcomes in patients with resected liver-confined metastases from colorectal carcinomas, and whether addition of bevacizumab (BEV) provides further benefit. METHODS: A total of 229 consecutive patients who underwent resection for liver-confined colorectal liver metastases were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Of 229 patients, 204 who received chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine-based (n = 27), irinotecan-based (n = 84) and oxaliplatin-based (n = 93) combinations were analyzed. Among these, 87 patients received BEV while 117 did not (NoBEV). With a median follow-up of 27 months after metastasectomy, the median recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were 17 and 53 months, respectively. OS rates at 3 and 5 years were 71% and 40%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the median RFS (p = 0.744) and OS (p = 0.440) among different chemotherapy regimens. The median RFS (p = 0.375) and OS (p = 0.251) were similar in BEV and NoBEV arms. In multivariate analysis, having 4 liver metastases was the only negative independent factor on both RFS and OS, while positive surgical margin was another negative independent factor for RFS. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy type and addition of BEV have no impact on both RFS and OS in the adjuvant setting following complete resection of colorectal liver metastases.
