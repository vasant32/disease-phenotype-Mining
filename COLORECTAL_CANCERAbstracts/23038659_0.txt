Capecitabine has shown significant antitumor activity against anthracycline/taxane refractory breast cancer and advanced colorectal carcinoma. The main drug-related adverse effects are palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome), diarrhea and stomatitis. Dyslipidemia is a rare but important side effect of this drug. The mechanism of capecitabine-induced hypertriglyceridemia (CI-HTG) is unclear. It may be due to the decreased activities of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic triglyceride lipase. This report is associated with 2 patients who developed severe HTG when receiving capecitabine. Capecitabine was discountinued and antilipemic treatments were given and both cases are in follow-up with normal lipid levels. This report describes CI-HTG and possible pathogenetic mechanisms and the literature is reviewed.
