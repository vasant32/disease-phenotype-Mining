 BACKGROUND: Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX) is an established treatment option in colorectal cancer, but can be associated with severe toxicities. METHODS: Following reporting of severe diarrhoea and dehydration with capecitabine 2000 mg m(-2) per day plus oxaliplatin every 3 weeks (CAPOX 2000) in 2006, we instituted a policy change to reduce capecitabine dose to 1700 mg m(-2) per day (CAPOX 1700). We undertook a retrospective analysis comparing toxicities encountered before and after this dose change. RESULTS: Of the 400 patients treated, no significant differences were seen between the CAPOX 2000 and CAPOX 1700 in grades 3 and 4 diarrhoea (21% vs 19%; P=0.80), stomatitis (0% vs 1%; P=0.50) or grades 2-4 hand foot syndrome (16% vs 11%; P=0.18). Grades 3 and 4 neutropenia (9.5% vs 3.5%; P=0.03) and all grades hyperbilirubinaemia (60% vs 40%; P<0.0001) were significantly reduced with CAPOX 1700. Rates of hospitalisation due to toxicities were not different between two groups (13% vs 11%; P=0.53). CONCLUSIONS: No clinically or statistically significant differences in gastrointestinal toxicities or hospitalisation rate were seen after reducing our routine capecitabine dose from CAPOX 2000 to CAPOX 1700.
