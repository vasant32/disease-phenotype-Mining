 BACKGROUND: Prediction of chemosensitivity is a major goal of modern oncology. The aim of this study was to establish a simple and effective model of primary culture of colorectal cancer fragments and to test whether it allows prediction of chemosensitivity. METHODS: Colorectal cancer fragments (primary tumors or liver metastases) of 94 consecutive and previously untreated patients were obtained, prepared, and cultured in polyHEMA. For each fragment cultured, a proliferative index (PI) was calculated after immunostaining at d 0 and after 7 d in culture with media alone or supplemented for 24h with the topoisomerase I inhibitor metabolite SN-38. The correlation between in vitro response (decrease in PI after exposure to the drug) and in vivo response (RECIST criteria) was studied in a subset of patients who had measurable metastases and were treated with a topoisomerase I inhibitor. RESULTS: PolyHEMA allowed three-dimensional culture of tumor fragments up to 7 d without fibroblastic invasion and with a slight but significant decrease of PI (59% at d 0 versus 51% after 7 d in culture, P < 0.001). In vitro drug efficacy was tested in 67 fragments, the mean PI after culture with SN-38 dropped to 22% (P < 0.001). In a subset of 12 patients, there was no statistically significant correlation between in vitro and in vivo response (P = 0.13). CONCLUSION: Primary culture in polyHEMA was easy to perform successfully in 71% of cases. On this model, the antiproliferative effect of SN-38 could be measured and results correlated to clinical data.
