The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of immunohistochemical expression of nm23 gene in colorectal cancer cells with tumor stage according to Dukes, tumor differentiation, occurrence of distant metastases and patient survival. This retrospective study included 100 colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment. Both pathological and clinical data were analyzed according to sex, age, immunohistochemical expression of nm23, tumor stage, tumor differentiation, occurrence of distant metastases and patient survival. Overexpression of nm23 gene was related to both good tumor differentiation and Dukes' stage A, whereas no significant correlation was found between the occurrence of metastases and nm23 gene expression. There was no significant correlation between nm23 gene expression and 5-year survival of colorectal cancer patients either. Although the results of this study suggested that higher expression of nm23 gene correlated with an early stage of tumor and its good differentiation, this parameter cannot yet be taken as an independent and reliable prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer.
