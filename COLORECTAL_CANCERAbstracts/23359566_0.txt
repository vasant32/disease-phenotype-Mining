 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression change of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at both mRNA and protein levels, and to evaluate its roles in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: In the present study, 50 patients with CRC, 35 patients with benign colorectal lesion and 42 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Expression levels of HLA class I mRNA and protein were determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The expression levels of HLA class I mRNA and proteins were not influenced by age and gender. The relative ratios of HLA class I mRNA were 0.99±0.27 in healthy controls, 0.76±0.19 in benign patients, and 0.48±0.21 in CRC patients. Mean fluorescence intensities of HLA class I were 145.58±38.14 in healthy controls, 102.05±35.98 in benign patients and 87.44±34.01 in CRC patients. HLA class I on PBMCs was significantly down-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in patients with stage III and IV CRC. CRC patients with lymph node metastasis also showed a decreased HLA class I expression at protein level. CONCLUSION: HLA class I expressions on PBMCs are associated with staging of CRC and lymph node metastasis. Monitoring the expression of HLA class I on PBMCs may provide useful information for diagnosis and metastasis judgement of CRC.
