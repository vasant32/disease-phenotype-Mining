Bevacizumab (BV) is widely used for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. We investigated the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with BV for metastatic colorectal cancer. From July 2007 to October 2008, 59 patients were treated by chemotherapy with BV in our hospital. Of the 47 patients who received BV in first-line therapy, 3 cases (6%) with complete response (CR), 25 cases(53%) with partial response (PR), and 17 cases (36%) with stable disease (SD) were observed. The overall response rate and tumor control rate were 60% and 96%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 11. 9 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 23. 6 months. There were 12 patients treated first with BV in second-line therapy. Of the 12 patients, 1 case (8%) with CR, 3 cases (25%) with PR, and 4 (33%) with SD were observed. The overall response rate and tumor control rate were 33% and 67%, respectively. The median PFS was 6.0 months and median OS was not reached. With regard to the grade 3 to 4 adverse events by NCI-CTCAE ver3.0, neutropenia was observed in more than half of the patients (56%), but a few of patients had gastrointestinal toxicities, peripheral neuropathy and infections in non-hematologic toxicities. BV-associated adverse events were hypertension, proteinuria, venous thrombosis, wound healing complication, gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding, each of which were few and not serious. Six of the patients experienced PD after first-line therapy treated with BV continuously in second-line therapy. Four of six were surviving without disease progression at the last follow-up, which suggests the effectiveness of continuation of BV. Our study showed the efficacy and safety of BV for metastatic colorectal cancer.
