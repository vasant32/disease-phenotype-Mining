 OBJECTIVES: Although surgical resection alone has been validated as a standard treatment for patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer, a high rate of recurrence is still an issue to be overcome. We aimed to assess the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy using an oxaliplatin-based regimen in patients who underwent hepatic and primary colorectal cancer resection. METHODS: Sixty patients who received oxaliplatin-based postoperative chemotherapy combined with curative resection of primary colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases between January 2000 and February 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival, and prognostic factors were evaluated with the log-rank test. RESULTS: Median overall survival (OS) was 62.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 44.1-81.3], and median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 32.8 months (95% CI 5.8-59.6). The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 95.0, 68.8 and 55.5%, respectively. The relapse-free interval and modality of liver resection were independently associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: Oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy after radical resection resulted in increased OS and RFS with acceptable tolerability compared to surgery alone. However, it is not yet clear whether postoperative oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy improves outcome compared to patients treated with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin.
