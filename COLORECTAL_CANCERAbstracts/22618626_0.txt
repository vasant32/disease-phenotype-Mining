CLINICAL/METHODICAL ISSUE:                          Staging and follow-up of colorectal cancer are usually performed with multimodal imaging strategies. These can be time-intensive and potentially lead to examiner-dependent bias. Alternatively, whole body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) provides oncologic imaging with a systemic approach.                                               STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS:                          Ultrasound, multislice computed tomography (MSCT), dedicated MRI and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT).                                               METHODICAL INNOVATIONS:                          High-resolution WB-MRI with focused examination of various organs, such as the pelvis and abdomen, lungs, brain and skeletal system, using different sequence and contrast techniques.                                               PERFORMANCE:                          Detection of colorectal tumor recurrence with WB-MRI provides 83% accuracy (lymph node metastases 80%, organ metastases 86%).                                               ACHIEVEMENTS:                          Potential cost reduction through decreased examination time and personnel costs.                                               PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:                          Whole body MRI is a radiation-free alternative to standard sequential algorithms of staging and follow-up of colorectal cancer.
