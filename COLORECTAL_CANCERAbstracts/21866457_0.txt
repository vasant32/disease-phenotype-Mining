 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcomes of surgical treatment and the prognostic factors of long-term survival for obstructing left colorectal cancer. METHODS: Clinicopathological and follow-up data of 93 patients with obstructing left colorectal cancer undergoing surgical treatment from January 2001 to December 2006 in the Affiliated Hospital of Medical College of Qingdao University were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 53 males and 40 females. The median age was 61 years old. Fifty-one patients had concurrent medical condition. Radical resection was performed in 67 patients, including one-stage resection (n=21), Hartmann procedure (n=35), and Miles procedure (n=11). Surgery was palliative in 26 patients, including diverting stoma (n=14), bypass surgery (n=7), and palliative resection (n=5). All the 93 patients were followed up. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 94%, 59%, and 38%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that radical resection, TNM staging, and preoperative level of carcinoembryonic antigen were independent prognostic factors (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Radical resection, TNM stage, and preoperative CEA level are prognostic factors of obstructing left colorectal cancer. Early diagnosis, radical resection, and selection of appropriate surgical procedure are helpful to prolong survival time of patients with obstructing left colorectal cancer.
