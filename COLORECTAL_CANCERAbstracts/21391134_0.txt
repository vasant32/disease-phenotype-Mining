This study has used the structural equation modelling to examine the role of benefit-finding (BF) in the context of the stress and coping model. In the study, 1276 individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer completed a written questionnaire and telephone interview at around 4.5 months (on average) and 12 months post-diagnosis. Analyses revealed that the final model fit the data, where stress, coping and BF accounted for 63% of the variance in Time 1 quality of life (QOL). Threat appraisal, coping resources, avoidant coping and BF directly impacted on Time 1 QOL, while threat appraisal, social support and approach coping directly impacted on BF. Approach coping and BF had differential relationships with stress, coping resources and outcomes, indicating that BF may not be a meaning-based coping strategy, as proposed by Folkman [Folkman, S. (1997). Positive psychological states and coping with severe stress. Social Science and Medicine, 45, 1207â€“1221]. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.
