CLINICAL CASE: A 32-year-old male, with colon cancer stage IV, resistant to chemotherapy, was referred to our department due to palpebral oedema, conjunctival chemosis, severe exophthalmos, complete ptosis in left eye, and limitation in eye movements, mainly in abduction and supraversion. In the orbital MR scan we observed two nodular lesions in the left orbital, with involvement of the superior rectus-elevator muscle of upper eyelid complex and external rectus muscle, suggestive of metastases. Due to the patient generally feeling unwell, radiotherapy was not considered, and an intravenous bolus of corticoids was given, without response, resulting in the death of the patient. DISCUSSION: Orbital metastases usually originate from breast and lung cancer, with those secondary to colon cancer being much less frequent. The treatment is palliative, based on intravenous corticoids, and, above all, radiotherapy, and, only in cases with a long-term survival, surgery.
