 BACKGROUND: We have extensively assessed a biweekly regimen of irinotecan plus folinic acid and fluorouracil bolus (IRIFAFU) in metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). Here, we report on the safety and activity of BIFF (bevacizumab plus IRIFAFU) regimen in 94 mCRC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg (1 hour), and irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) (1 hour) were given intravenously on day 1, 6S-folinic acid 250 mg/m(2) (2 hours), and fluorouracil 850 mg/m(2) (bolus) were given intravenously on day 2 every 2 weeks for a median of 9 cycles per patient (range, 1-12), and maintenance bevacizumab alone was delivered in 16 cases. RESULTS: Grade â‰¥ 3 hematologic toxicities were neutropenia (50%) and febrile neutropenia (5%). Most common grade 3 nonhematologic side effects were diarrhea (20%), vomiting (7%), nausea (4%), and stomatitis (4%). Severe hypertension (1%) and epistaxis (1%) rarely occurred. Six complete responses and 44 partial responses were registered, giving a response rate of 53% (95% CI, 43%-64%). Median progression-free survival was 11.5 months (95% CI, 9.0-14.0 months). Forty-three (46%) patients eventually died, and the median overall survival was 24.0 months (95% CI, 20.2-27.8 months). CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab appeared to increase the activity of the IRIFAFU regimen without worsening its tolerability. Efficacy of BIFF was comparable with that reported with other bevacizumab plus irinotecan-based combinations.
