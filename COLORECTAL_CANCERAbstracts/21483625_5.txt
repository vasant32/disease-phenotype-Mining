Gut-associated lymphoid tissue is supposed to play a central role in both the organization of colonic repair mechanisms and colorectal carcinogenesis. In inflammatory conditions, the number, diameter and density of isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) increases. They are not only involved in immune surveillance, but their presence is also indispensable in normal mucosal regeneration of the colon. In carcinogenesis, ILFs may play a dual role. On the one hand they may support tumor growth and the metastatic process by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling and producing a specific cytokine and cellular milieu, but on the other hand their presence is sometimes associated with a better prognosis. The relation of ILFs to bone marrow derived stem cells, follicular dendritic cells, subepithelial myofibroblasts or crypt formation, which are all involved in mucosal repair and carcinogenesis, has not been directly studied. Data about the putative organizer role of ILFs is scattered in scientific literature.
