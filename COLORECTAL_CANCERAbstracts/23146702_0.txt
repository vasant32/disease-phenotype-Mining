 INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a population between 40 and 75 years-old, as well as acceptability and early diagnosis tests made. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Location: El Coto and El Llano (Gijon) primary care health centres. A total of 800 individuals aged between 40 and 75 years participated, selected by simple random sampling. Key measurements: questionnaire conducted by telephone with previous notice by newsletter. The variables studied were: family history (FH) of CRC, age at diagnosis, performance of faecal occult blood test (FOBT)/colonoscopy, reason for doing it or refusing it, and sociodemographic data. RESULTS: A total of 664 questionnaires were valid. The prevalence of FH was 15.8% (confidence interval 12.9 to 18.6), with 8.8% with at least one first degree relative. An FOBT screening had been performed on 7.1%, and 17.9% had undergone colonoscopies, mostly on clinical grounds. Acceptability was 90.7% for FOBT and 65.2% for colonoscopy. Main reason for the refusal of an FOBT was the belief that early diagnosis would not alter prognosis. Main reason for rejection of colonoscopy was discomfort or fear of the test. CONCLUSIONS: There was a low rate of testing for FH, and a high acceptability for FOBT and a low acceptability for colonoscopy. Aspects affecting the general population (causes for rejection, need for clear information), as well as a correct coordination between Primary Care, specialized care, and public health, need to be reviewed.
