A community needs assessment focused on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening knowledge, behaviors, and barriers was completed in one Ohio Appalachia county. A CRC screening media campaign was developed based on the findings from the needs assessment and feedback was obtained about the media campaign. The survey was completed by 170 self-reported average-risk adults. In a multivariate model, the CRC screening rate was higher for participants who had received a doctor's recommendation (OR = 6.09) and had adequate CRC knowledge (OR = 2.88), and it was lower among participants employed full-time (OR = 0.23). Having health insurance (OR = 4.20) and being married (OR = 2.58) was associated with having received a doctor's recommendation for screening. Campaign feedback using a second survey completed by self-reported average-risk adults (n = 61) revealed that 69% recognized the campaign image and message, with a billboard being the most cited source. This study highlights the importance of involving community members in the development of CRC screening programs to reduce cancer disparities in Appalachia.
