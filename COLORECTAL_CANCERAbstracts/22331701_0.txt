 PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to certify a rationality of Pathological Prognostic Score (PPS) in determining the prognosis of patients with colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: Three hundred and thirty-one patients with colorectal carcinoma, which had been treated by surgical resection, were enrolled. One point was added for each element among four tumor-related pathological factors of depth of tumor, lymph node metastasis, venous invasion, and lymphatic invasion. PPS was determined by an aggregate of the points. RESULTS: There existed a significant difference both between survivals of patients with PPS 0 or 1 and 2 or 3 (P = 0.0005) and between survivals of patients with PPS 2 or 3 and 4 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: PPS could be an easy and useful criteria to stratify prognosis of patients with colorectal carcinoma.
