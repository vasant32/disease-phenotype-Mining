 AIM: To estimate the incidence and mortality trends of gastric and colorectal cancers in Croatia between 1988 and 2008. METHODS: Incidence data for the period 1988-2008 were obtained from the Croatian National Cancer Registry. The number of deaths from gastric and colorectal cancers were obtained from the World Health Organization mortality database. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to describe changes in trends by sex. RESULTS: Gastric cancer incidence rates declined steadily during the study period, with estimated annual percent change (EAPC) of -3.2% for men and -2.8% for women. Mortality rates in men decreased, with EAPC of -5.0% from 1988-1995 and -2.5% from 1995-2008. Mortality rates in women decreased, with EAPC of -3.2% throughout the study period. For colorectal cancer in men, joinpoint analysis revealed increasing trends of both incidence (EAPC 2.9%) and mortality (EAPC 2.1%). In women, the increase in incidence was not significant, but mortality rates in the last 15 years showed a significant increase (EAPC 1.1%). CONCLUSION: The incidence and mortality trends of gastric cancer in Croatia are similar to other European countries, while the still increasing colorectal cancer mortality calls for more efficient prevention and treatment.
