Colorectal cancer is a leading contributing cause of death for malignancy in the general population. An efficient screening policy would result in a remarkable decrease in cancer-related mortality since a benign, fully removable adenoma is the biologic precursor in the vast majority of cases. Endoscopy of the lower bowel and fecal occult blood test are considered relevant means of providing effective cancer screening and early diagnosis of benign cancer precursors. Compliance to screening programs is key to effective cancer screening. This review deals with colorectal cancer screening programs with a particular focus on the most recent national and international guidelines on cancer screening and follow-up policies.
