 INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is the third most common neoplasia and the second cause of death due to cancer in developed countries. Approximately 10% of patients with this diagnosis develop lung metastases, although only 2-4% of them have lung metastases as the only extension location. OBJECTIVE: To study the prognostic factors of colorectal cancer lung metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on 30 patients with colorectal cancer lung metastases who were operated on in our hospital between January 2003 and December 2007. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients who received surgery, 19 were males (63%) and 11 were female (37%), with a mean age of 63.37 years (range 35-82 years). The mean overall survival was 36.64 months (range 18.58-54.70 months). A total of 13 pre-, intra-, and postoperative parameters were used in the statistical analysis. In the univariate analysis, the number of metastases greater than 3 (P=.051), whether they were bilateral (P=.001), or bilobar (P<.001), were statistically significant factors of a poor prognosis. In the multivariate analysis, only being bilobar was shown to be a statistically significant factor of a poor prognosis (P=.005). CONCLUSIONS: In our patient series affected by colorectal carcinoma lung metastases, the number of metastases greater than three, whether they are bilobar and bilateral, are factors of a poor prognosis. These factors should be taken into account in the follow-up of these patients, although prospective studies with a larger number of patients are required to confirm these findings.
