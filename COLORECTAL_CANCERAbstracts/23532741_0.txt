Bevacizumab is largely used in colorectal cancer patients. Postsurgical healing complications have been described for patients following treatment with Bevacizumab. We report three cases of spontaneous intestinal perforation following infusion of Bevacizumab. From January 2002 through October 2010, Bevacizumab was delivered in 143 patients. Spontaneous intestinal perforation occurred in 3 cases (2.1Â %). Bevacizumab may result in severe complications. Therefore, it is important to consider every patient treated with Bevacizumab at risk for life-threatening gastro-intestinal complications.
