The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. CRC tissues and distal normal mucosa tissues of 158 CRC patients were detected by immunohistochemistry. The correlations between MMP-13 expression, the patients' clinicopathological features, and overall survival rate were analyzed. It was found that positive expression rate of MMP-13 in distal normal mucosa tissues was significantly lower than that in CRC tissues (36.7% vs 60.8%, p < 0.001). Poor histological differentiation, advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis were significantly correlated with the MMP-13 expression in CRC. The overall survival rate of the MMP-13-negative group was significantly higher than the positive group (Log-rank test = 12.452, p < 0.001). Collectively, we found that MMP-13 was correlated with progression and metastasis of CRC and could be used as a prognostic marker in CRC.
