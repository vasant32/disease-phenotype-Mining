 OBJECTIVE: Adipocytokines have been reported to contribute to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this matched case-control study was to explore circulating novel adipocytokines, such as serum visfatin, omentin-1 and vaspin levels in patients with CRC. METHOD: Serum visfatin, omentin-1, and vaspin levels were measured in 69 subjects (39 patients with colorectal cancer and 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, patients with CRC had significantly higher circulating omentin-1 (203.23 vs 9.12ng/ml, p<0.0001) visfatin (4.03 vs 2.01ng/ml, p<0.0001) and vaspin (0.54 vs 0.31ng/ml, p=0.015) levels. After adjustment for covariates (age and body mass index), patients with CRC had significantly higher serum omentin-1 (p<0.0001), visfatin (p<0.0001), and vaspin (p=0.040) levels than the control group. Furthermore, the results did not change when age and waist-to-hip ratio were considered as covariates in the general linear models. CONCLUSIONS: The observed higher levels of omentin-1, visfatin, and vaspin in patients with CRC, independent of measures of obesity, suggest that these adipocytokines may have a potential role in the development of CRC through mechanisms other than the indirect mechanisms that are active in the association between obesity and CRC.
