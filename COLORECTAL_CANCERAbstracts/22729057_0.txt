 AIM: To test the feasibility of collecting dietary data from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in Auckland, New Zealand and to investigate their dietary information needs post-surgery, in terms of current information sources and satisfaction. METHODS: A food frequency questionnaire was used to collect information on the dietary intake and patterns of patients who had undergone surgical resection of CRC in the Auckland region. Dietary intakes were compared to the Ministry of Health Food and Nutrition Guidelines for Adult New Zealanders (FNG-MoH) along with other publications of dietary patterns in patients with CRC. Participants were also asked to report on what dietary information they received and their satisfaction with this information. RESULTS: Thirty participants completed the survey. Sixty-seven percent and 50% of participants met the recommended daily servings of fruit and vegetables respectively in the FNG-MoH. Four distinct dietary patterns were described for the study population. Over 50% of participants indicated that they did not receive any dietary information after surgery. CONCLUSION: We were able to collect dietary information from this patient group, and this demonstrated that a significant proportion of the study population did not meet the FNG-MoH guidelines for recommended daily fruit and vegetable servings, and that there is an unmet information need in this patient group.
