Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is an inducible enzyme that converts arachidonic             acid to prostaglandins, and it is hypothesized to induce carcinogenesis and metastasis             in colorectal cancer. Our previous data also indicated that a higher expression             level of Cox-2 was correlated with colorectal cancer metastasis. The Cox-2 protein             was detected in the glandular cavity of colorectal cancer and the surrounding             interstitial tissues. The usefulness of the Cox-2 gene as a gene therapy target             and diagnostic marker remains unknown. In this study, a method using immuno-PCR             and real-time PCR followed by supramolecular immunobead real-time PCR was established             and used to detect the expression of Cox-2 in serum samples of nude mice with             colorectal carcinoma. In addition, we established a Cox-2 gene stable knockdown             colorectal cell line (SW480-EGFP-Cox-2 shRNA) using lentiviral vector-mediated             RNA interference (RNAi) technology and established an imageable colorectal cancer             metastasis mouse model. We found that the proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis             of SW480-EGFP-Cox-2 shRNA cells were attenuated compared with SW480 cells. In vivo             experiments also demonstrated that angiogenesis in the Cox-2 knockdown colorectal             cancer cells was decreased. The whole body optical imaging revealed that the SW480-EGFP-Cox-2             shRNA cells had an abrogated ability to develop metastases in the lymph nodes,             lungs or liver in vivo. The improved immunobead PCR assay detected significantly             lower Cox-2 protein levels in the serum samples of the SW480-EGFP-Cox-2 shRNA             group compared with those of the SW480-EGFP-Cox-2-Ctrl shRNA group. In conclusion,             our results indicated that the knockdown of Cox-2 expression suppressed the proliferation             and invasion of colorectal cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This study             also demonstrated that silencing Cox-2 in vivo reduced the metastastic potential             of colorectal cancer. Thus, Cox-2 is a promising marker for the diagnosis of colorectal             metastasis and a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.
