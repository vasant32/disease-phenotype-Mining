 OBJECTIVES: A personal or family history of colorectal adenomas increases the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to compare physicians' communication with polyp patients vs. non-polyp patients, assess whether polyps or CRC family history were associated with physician-patient communication, and describe patients' disclosure of colonoscopy and polyp diagnosis to their relatives. METHODS: Four hundred nine patients completed an online survey regarding physician-patient communication of colonoscopy results, perceived personal and familial risk of polyps and CRC, and disclosure of colonoscopy results to relatives. RESULTS: Six percent of participants reported that their physicians discussed familial risks. Polyp diagnosis and family history predicted physician-patient discussions about familial CRC risks. Polyp diagnosis predicted physician-patient discussions of future surveillance. Twenty-two percent of patients told none of their relatives that they had a colonoscopy. Family history, gender, and education were associated with patient-family communication. CONCLUSIONS: There is room for improvement in physician-patient and patient-family communication following colonoscopy.
