The immune interactions occurring within the tumor microenvironment have a critical role in determining the outcome of colorectal cancer patients. We carried-out an immunohistochemical analysis of tumor infiltrating T-lymphocytes expressing chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) in a series of colorectal cancer patients enrolled in a prospective clinical trial. We demonstrated that a high tumor infiltration score of this lymphocyte subset is predictive of longer progression free survival and overall survival.
