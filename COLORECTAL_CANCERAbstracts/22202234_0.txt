cDNA microarray technology has been used to identify HLA-A24-restricted epitope peptides as potential targets for cancer vaccination in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. We conducted a clinical trial of two novel cancer-specific peptides( RNF43, TOMM34) with UFT/LV for the treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer. Among 23 patients, 21 patients had completed the protocol. All patients were well tolerated with no severe toxicities. The median survival time was 24.4 months. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between CTL response to both antigens and overall survival. The best long-term survival was observed in the group with CTL responses against both antigens, followed by the group showing CTL responses against only RNF43 or TOMM34. The patients with no response had the lowest survival. Based on the results, we started a randomized trial of the current protocol, as adjuvant immunochemotherapy in following curative resection of Stage III colorectal cancer patients.
