Considerable progress in cancer prevention, early detection and treatment has led to a reduction in the incidence and mortality of this disease, and resulted in significant improvements in cancer survival. Despite these advances, certain populations in Connecticut continue to suffer disparately from this frequently debilitating disease. In this article, we use data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry to examine trends in the four most commonly diagnosed cancers (breast, prostate, lung and colorectal) that collectively account for more than 50% of cancers diagnosed annually in Connecticut. We report on time trends and compare incidence and mortality rates, stage at diagnosis, survival and screening rates, giving insight into opportunities to improve health and reduce disparities in residents of the state.
