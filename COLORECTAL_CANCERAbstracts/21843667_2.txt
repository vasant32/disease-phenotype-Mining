The emergence of laser capture microdissection (LCM) and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) has been shown to greatly improve the accuracy and sensitivity of global protein expression analysis. However, their combined use in profiling tumour proteome has rarely been reported. In this study, we applied these techniques to profile the protein expression changes of the late stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and its liver metastases. The study revealed that both the primary and secondary tumours showed a distinct protein expression profile compared to normal tissues, but were indistinguishable from each other. Differential analysis between the primary tumour and patient-matched normal colon mucosa identified a total of 71 proteins to be altered in CRC. Over 40% of these proteins have been previously reported as CRC-related proteins, validating the accuracy of the current analysis. We have also identified many previously unknown changes including overexpression of ACY1, HSC70, HnRNP I, HnRNP A3, SET, ANP32A and TUFM in CRC, which have been further verified by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. This study demonstrated that LCM in combination with 2D-DIGE is a powerful tool to analyse the proteome of tumour tissues and may lead to the identification of potential novel protein markers and therapeutic targets for cancer.
