Colorectal cancer (CRC) is third in cancer incidence and mortality, due in part to lack of awareness and low rates of screening. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of a spiritually based CRC educational intervention delivered by trained Community Health Advisors, in Alabama churches. The aim of the intervention was to increase knowledge and awareness of CRC and early detection, and to eventually increase CRC screening rates. Participants age-eligible for screening (N = 122) completed baseline, 6-month, and 12-month surveys by telephone. Increases in CRC knowledge, perceived benefits of CRC screening, and awareness of the screening modalities and decreases in perceived barriers to screening suggested that this type of intervention may be promising for CRC control and should be examined further.
