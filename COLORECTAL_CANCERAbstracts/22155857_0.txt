 BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of using creatinine clearance rate (CCr) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) study in objectively assessing oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, a study was performed. METHODOLOGY: Sixty-eight patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal carcinoma were enrolled. FOLFOX-4 regimen was administrated as first-line chemotherapy. Patients were divided into CCr-impaired (60-80mL/min) and CCr-fair (>80mL/min) groups before treatment. NCV was examined accordingly, and the correlations of CCr and NCV with oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy were analyzed. RESULTS: An excellent correlation was identified in impaired CCr and the severity of neurological symptoms (p<0.01). Nine (47.3%) CCr-impaired patients developed severe (grade 3 or 4) neuropathy and only 5 (10.2%) CCr-fair patients developed grade 3/4 neuropathy. A good correlation was found in NCV abnormalities and the severity of neuropathy, too (p<0.01). Thirteen (33.3%) patients with impaired NCV developed grade 3/4 neuropathy but only one (3.4%) patient with normal NCV had grade 3/4 neuropathy. However, there remained 26 (66.7%) NCV-impaired patients who had no or only mild neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CCr and NCV correlate well with the severity of neurological symptoms in colorectal cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. The additions of CCr and NCV, to a precise physical examination, are helpful in objectively assessing oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy.
