 AIM: To assess the clinical role of monoclonal immunoscintigraphy for the detection of metastasis and recurrence of colorectal cancer. METHODS: Monoclonal immunoscintigraphy was performed in patients operated on for colorectal adenocarcinoma suspected of local recurrence and metastatic disease. The results were compared with conventional diagnostics. RESULTS: Immunoscintigraphic investigation was done in 53 patients. Tumor recurrence occurred in 38 patients, and was confirmed by other diagnostic modalities in 35. In 15 patients, immunoscintigraphic findings were negative, and confirmed in 14 with other diagnostic methods. Comparative analysis confirmed good correlation of immunoscintigraphic findings and the results of conventional diagnostics and the level of tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen. Statistical analysis of parameters of radiopharmaceutical groups imacis, indimacis and oncoscint presented homogenous characteristics all of three radiopharmaceuticals. The analysis of immunoscintigraphic target focus was clearly improved using tomography. CONCLUSION: Immunoscintigraphy is highly specific and has a good predictive value in local recurrence of colorectal cancer.
