We report a rare case of a patient with colorectal cancer with chest wall metastases. The development of bleeding at the site of the metastasis ultimately resulted in the development of a hematoma, necessitating resection of the tumor along with part of the chest wall. Literature on chest wall metastases of colonic adenocarcinoma is reviewed and discussed. The teaching point is that a chest wall mass seen on imaging should prompt consideration of metastatic cancer in the differential diagnosis. The colon is a rare though reported primary site.
