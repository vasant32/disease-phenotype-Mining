Although colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is superior to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in en bloc resection rate, it is technically quite difficult because of the anatomical and histological characteristics of the colorectal wall. This difficulty prevents wide spread of the technique. Establishment of the training system for colorectal ESD is necessary to standardize training and to achieve wider acceptance of this technique. Herein, we describe our training system for colorectal ESD, and assess the validity of the training system for colorectal ESD, based on the clinical outcomes and learning curve of trainees. Our training system for colorectal ESD would help the spread of this procedure.
