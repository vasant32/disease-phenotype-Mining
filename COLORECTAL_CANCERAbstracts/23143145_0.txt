The most common site of metastases in patients with colorectal cancer is the liver. Hepatic resection is considered to be the treatment of choice for liver metastasis from colorectal cancer; however, hepatic resection can be performed in only 20 or 25Â % of all patients. Recurrence develops in the remnant liver or other organs after hepatic resection in over half of all patients with liver-only metastasis. Hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy can provide relatively high concentrations of drugs to microscopic or macroscopic metastases in the liver, with less toxicity than systemic administration. Meta-analyses have shown HAI chemotherapy to have a significantly higher response rate than systemic chemotherapy and its effect on extrahepatic metastases is negligible. HAI chemotherapy provides much better local control of liver metastases from colorectal cancer than systemic chemotherapy. However, well-controlled studies are needed to elucidate the optimal treatment strategies for neoadjuvant and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy that optimally combine HAI chemotherapy, molecular targeted agents, and systemic chemotherapy such as FOLFOX or FOLFIRI.
