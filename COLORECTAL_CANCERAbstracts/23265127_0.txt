Estrogen-receptor-beta (ERβ), progesterone receptor (PR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) have been implicated in colorectal cancer. However, the clinicopathological significance of any expression of these markers remains unclear. Immunohistochemical assays of ERα,  ERβ, PR, and VEGF-A were performed on 72 colorectal cancer cases. Normal mucosa from the same cases was assessed as a control. The correlation of presence of these markers with clinicopathological features and survival was determined. ERα and PR were not expressed in tumors. Forty-one  of 53 (77.4%) cases of normal mucosa showed strong ERβ expression compared with weak expression in 32 of 72 (44.4%) of malignant cells. A significant decrease in ERβ expression from normal mucosa to tumor was found in females (P = 0.007) but not in males (P = 0.149).  VEGF-A was expressed strongly in malignant cells in 64 of 72 (89%) cases. No association was found between ERβ or VEGF-A expression and tumor grade, angiolymphatic involvement, stage, disease-free survival, or overall survival. Colorectal cancers do not express ERα or PR. ERβ  may have a protective role, especially in females. VEGF-A may have a role in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, ERβ and VEGF-A cannot be used as prognostic markers.
