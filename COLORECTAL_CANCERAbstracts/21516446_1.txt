 BACKGROUND: The association between colorectal cancer (CRC) and diverticulosis is uncertain, and there is little data reported in Asia. This study examined the association of both diseases based on the computed tomographic colonography (CTC). METHODS: This study was designed as a case-control study. Korean subjects undergoing CTC between April 2002 to April 2008 in Samsung Medical Center were eligible. Patients with histologically proven colorectal cancer (case group) and asymptomatic age and gender matched controls (control group) were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 604 subjects were enrolled in this study (Case group N = 302, Control group N = 302). The case group was 54.6% male and the median age was 56.9 years old. Among them 24.5% of CRC patients had diverticulosis compared to 29.5% of controls (P = 0.169). The distribution of diverticulosis between the two groups was similar. Subset analysis revealed no difference in the location of diverticulosis in patients with right colon cancer and left colon cancer (P = 0.781). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that CRC is not associated with diverticulosis.
