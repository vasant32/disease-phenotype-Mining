Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, such as bevacizumab, have improved outcomes in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent studies have suggested that VEGF can delay the onset of cellular senescence in human endothelial cells. As VEGF receptors are known to be upregulated in CRC, we hypothesized that VEGF inhibition may directly influence cellular senescence in this disease. In our study, we observed that treatment with bevacizumab caused a significant increase (p < 0.05) in cellular senescence in vitro in several CRC cells, such as MIP101, RKO, SW620 and SW480 cells, compared to untreated or human IgG-treated control cells. Similar results were also obtained from cells treated with a VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor Ki8751. In vivo, cellular senescence was detected in MIP101 tumor xenografts from 75% of mice treated with bevacizumab, while cellular senescence was undetectable in xenografts from mice treated with saline or human IgG (p < 0.05). Interestingly, we also observed that the proportion of senescent cells in colon cancer tissues obtained from patients treated with bevacizumab was 4.4-fold higher (p < 0.01) than those of untreated patients. To understand how VEGF inhibitors may regulate cellular senescence, we noted that among the two important regulators of senescent growth arrest of tumor cells, bevacizumab-associated increase in cellular senescence coincided with an upregulation of p16 but appeared to be independent of p53. siRNA silencing of p16 gene in MIP101 cells suppressed bevacizumab-induced cellular senescence, while silencing of p53 had no effect. These findings demonstrate a novel antitumor activity of VEGF inhibitors in CRC, involving p16.
