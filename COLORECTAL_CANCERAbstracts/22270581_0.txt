 PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine the diagnostic capabilities of water enema-multidetector row computed tomography (WE-MDCT) in the detection of colorectal tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and one patients (55 male, 46 female) who had WE-MDCT and videocolonoscopy because of suspected colorectal tumors were included. Results of complete videocolonoscopy, surgery, and histopathologic analysis were used as standard of reference. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of WE-MDCT for the diagnosis of colorectal tumors were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Ninety-two colorectal tumors (64 malignant, 28 benign) were confirmed in 71 patients (prevalence, 71/101; 70%). Overall sensitivity for colorectal tumor detection was 87% (80/92; 95%CI: 78%-93%) on a per lesion basis. For malignant and benign tumor detection, sensitivity was 100% (64/64; 95%CI: 94%-100%) and 57% (16/28; 95%CI: 37%-76%), respectively. For colorectal tumors ≥10 mm, sensitivity was 99% (76/77; 95%CI: 93%-100%). Seventy-nine of the 83 colorectal tumors ≥6 mm were detected, yielding a sensitivity of 95% (79/83; 95%CI: 88%-99%) for this specific size category. On a per patient basis, WE-MDCT had a sensitivity of 100% (71/71; 95%CI: 94%-100%), a specificity of 100% (30/30; 95%CI: 88%-100%), an accuracy of 100% (101/101; 95%CI: 96%-100%), a positive predictive value of 100% (71/71; 95%CI: 94%-100%), and a negative predictive value of 100% (30/30; 95%CI: 86%-100%) for the diagnosis of colorectal tumor. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that WE-MDCT is a promising imaging technique for the detection of malignant colorectal tumors. However, our results should be validated by larger and prospective studies.
