 BACKGROUND/AIMS: There is a paucity of national guideline for colorectal cancer screening and polyp diagnosis in Korea. Thus, we investigated the present state of colorectal cancer screening and polyp diagnosis methods using web-based survey to use as reference data for developing a guideline. METHODS: A multiple choice questionnaires of screening recommendations was sent via e-mail to members of the Korean Association for the Study of Intestinal Diseases and primary care physicians who participated in the national colonoscopy surveillance program. Among 425 colonoscopists, a total 263 colonoscopists replied (response rate, 61.9%). RESULTS: The most commonly recommended starting age for colorectal cancer screening and polyp diagnosis was 50 years old in the average risk group, and 40 years old in groups who had a family history of colon cancer (64.3% and 65.0% respectively). Surgeons had a tendency to recommend screening in younger people than internist do. Ninety-eight percent of physicians recommended screening colonoscopy to asymptomatic, average-risk patients as a first choice. Only 2% of physicians chose sigmoidoscopy as a screening tool. When the initial colonoscopy showed a negative finding, over 60% of internists repeated the exam 5 years later, whereas 62% of surgeons did so within 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The starting age of colorectal cancer screening and the interval of the colorectal polyp examination are not uniform in various medical environments, and there is a discrepancy between the practical recommendations and western guidelines. Thus, a new evidence-based national practice guideline for colorectal cancer screening and polyp diagnosis should be developed.
