Screening colonoscopy is an efficient and safe instrument for the early detection of colonic neoplasia. The cumulative participation rate in Germany remains low with 15.5% of eligible men and 17.2% of eligible women. Reasons for this are not well understood. Especially physicians have an important role. The aim of this study was to analyse information and recommendations of primary care physicians, urologists and gynaecologists on colorectal cancer screening. A survey of 239 primary care physicians, urologists and gynaecologists by a structured questionnaire on information concerning colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer prevention was carried out. Statistical analysis was performed by pair-wise comparison of the three groups. There were only small differences between primary care physicians, urologists and gynaecologists. Primary care physicians offer patients more consulting time for this information than the other two groups. In the majority of cases colonoscopy is recommended. Gynaecologists less often recommend the classical guaiac-based faecal occult blood test, but more frequently immunochemical tests. The complication rate of colonoscopy is overestimated at 1.25% (0 - 40%). The majority of physicians have previously participated in colorectal cancer screening. Information about the risk of colorectal cancer and screening has a high priority. The level of knowledge of physicians may be improved.
