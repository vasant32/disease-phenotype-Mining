 BACKGROUND: The KRAS mutation is not responsible for all cases of resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), and new predictive and prognostic factors are actively being sought. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of a cetuximab-containing treatment in 73 patients with mCRC according to KRAS and BRAF mutational status as well as PTEN, c-MET, and insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) expression. RESULTS: Overall response rate (ORR), median progression-free survival (mPFS), and median overall survival (mOS) were significantly lower in patients with KRAS mutation than in patients with KRAS wild-type; among the population with KRAS wild-type, only 2 patients with BRAF mutations were found and neither of them achieved a response. No significant association was found between PTEN and clinical outcome. Compared with low/normal expression, c-MET overexpression significantly correlated with shorter mPFS and mOS: 3 vs. 5 months (P = .018) and 11 vs. 10 months (P = .037), respectively. In patients with high IGF1R expression, mOS was significantly longer than in those with low/normal expression (14 vs. 8 months; P = .015). CONCLUSION: KRAS mutation significantly correlates with a worse outcome in patients treated with cetuximab, whereas no definitive inference can be drawn about the role of BRAF mutation and PTEN loss of expression. Instead, c-MET overexpression might represent a negative prognostic factor in mCRC and may have a role in resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. Interestingly, IGF1R overexpression seems a favorable prognostic factor in mCRC.
