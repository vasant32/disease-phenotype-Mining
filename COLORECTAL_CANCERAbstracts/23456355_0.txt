PURPOSE: Recurrent disease following complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a relevant clinical scenario. We aimed to determine risk factors for recurrence. METHODS: Prospectively collected data of patients enrolled in the Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Program at the University of Tübingen between 2005 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated by standardized CRS and HIPEC. Recurrence was defined either radiographically by CT, PET-CT scan, or reoperation. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients received complete CRS (CC-0/CC-1) and HIPEC. Median time to recurrence was 229 days (103-1,028). Overall recurrence rate within follow-up was 48 %. Of patients with recurrent disease, 44 % experienced extraperitoneal systemic tumor spread. In multivariate analysis, grading of ≥3 was shown as an independent risk factor for recurrent disease, while a trend was observed for maximal tumor load in the upper abdominal region. Clinical parameters did not show an impact on recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Primary tumor grading seems to be an independent risk factor for recurrence following complete CRS and HIPEC in colorectal cancer-derived peritoneal surface malignancies.
