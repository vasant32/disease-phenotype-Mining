 OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of a program to promote colorectal cancer screening (CRC) among uninsured Latinas receiving mammography through a cancer screening clinic in northern Manhattan. METHODS: Between August 2009 and March 2010, unscreened, average CRC risk, uninsured Latinas, aged 50-64 years, undergoing mammography received a screening recommendation, education, and fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Socio-demographic information and level of acculturation was collected. Screening compliance was assessed. RESULTS: Of 651 Latinas evaluated, 210 were eligible and, of these, 94% (n=197) consented to participate; 441 were excluded because they were up-to-date with CRC screening (n=130), < 50 (n=285) or >64 (n=26) years of age. After intervention, 177 (90%) completed FIT. Within 2 weeks, 87% completed the FIT, and 69% did so with no reminder calls. Acculturation was significantly lower among screeners (p=0.014). Compared with non-screeners, screeners were more likely to be foreign-born (p=0.009), to speak only Spanish (p=0.043), and to prefer to read (p=0.037), and think (p=0.015) in Spanish. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that pairing CRC education and screening with mammography is both feasible and efficacious.
