 BACKGROUND: The incidence of colorectal cancer in Australia is among the highest worldwide. We investigate whether similar treatment results for colorectal cancer can be achieved in rural surgery as reported from metropolitan centres. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected follow-up data in a rural surgical centre in South Australia has been carried out. Results of all patients undergoing surgical treatment for colorectal cancer are analysed, and all cancer stages and interventions over a 5-year period are included. RESULTS: Five-year survival of all patients (n = 194) treated for colorectal cancer independent of stage and cause of death was 56%, cancer-specific 5-year survival was 64%. Perioperative mortality was 1.7%. Overall survival was 96% in stage 1, 92% in stage 2, 58% in stage 3 and 0% for patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Cancer-specific survival ranged from 100% in stage 1 to 0% for patients with metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of overall and cancer-specific survival of all patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer over a 5-year time period in a rural South Australian centre shows that good long-term results can be achieved with low perioperative mortality. These findings compare well with the results of other groups.
