Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cause of death from cancer in the world. The limitations of the currently available methods and biomarkers for CRC management highlight the necessity of finding novel markers. Metabonomics can be used to search for potential markers that can provide molecular insight into human CRC. The emergence of two-dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC/TOFMS) has comprehensively enhanced the metabolic space coverage of conventional GC/MS. In this study, a GC × GC/TOFMS was developed for the tissue-based global metabonomic profiling of CRC. A Pegasus GC × GC/TOFMS (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA) system comprising an Agilent 7890 GC and Pegasus IV TOFMS was used for this purpose. An Agilent DB-1 (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm) fused silica capillary column and a Restek Rxi®-17 (1 m × 100 μm × 0.10 μm) fused silica capillary column were used as the primary and secondary columns, respectively. The method was applied for global metabonomic profiling of matched CRC and normal tissues (n = 63) obtained from 31 CRC patients during surgery. An attempt was also made to compare GC × GC/TOFMS with GC/MS and NMR in similar application. The results showed that the metabotype associated with CRC is distinct from that of normal tissue and led to the identification of chemically diverse marker metabolites. Metabolic pathway mapping suggested deregulation of various biochemical processes such as glycolysis, Krebs cycle, osmoregulation, steroid biosynthesis, eicosanoid biosynthesis, bile acid biosynthesis, lipid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism.
