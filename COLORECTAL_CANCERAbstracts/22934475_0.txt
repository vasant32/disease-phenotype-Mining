Colorectal cancer is among the three most common and lethal neoplasms in Switzerland (about 4,000 new cases and 1,600 deaths per year, respectively). Several screening modalities are available. The effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening on mortality is established. The implementation of a successful screening intervention shall follow specified phases and conditions, and abide with global principles: pooling and coordinating efforts from all partners, setting goals and priorities, and identifying action plans. A feasibility (pilot) study is needed to verify requirements for quality, effectiveness, efficiency and innocuousness. Endeavours towards implementing a pilot programme for colorectal cancer screening in the Vaud canton (Switzerland) are presented and discussed.
