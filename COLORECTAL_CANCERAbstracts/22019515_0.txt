Recent advances in our understanding of the microRNAome (miRNAome) have provided further insights into the molecular pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and shown a potential role for miRNAs in distinguishing molecular subtypes. The mucosa-adenoma-carcinoma model can now integrate miRNAs into the known genetic alterations that drive the progression of colorectal neoplasia.
