The milieu of the liver, and in particular hepatocyte-derived extracellular matrix (hECM), is a critical factor regulating development of liver metastases of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The present study has investigated genes altered by hECM in CRC cells and particularly by heparan sulfate chains of hepatocyte proteoglycans. Gene profiling analysis shows that after 2 days on hECM, 226 genes are up-regulated more than 2-fold in strongly metastatic SM cells, including genes involved in growth arrest and apoptosis, signal transduction, cell migration, proliferation, communication and angiogenesis, with activation of the erbB signaling network and p53 effectors. Genes down-regulated by hECM include genes involved in lipogenesis and the S phase of the cell cycle. Further studies exploring the kinetics of gene expression after 4 and 7 days culture on hECM show induction of EGF family members and of stem cell markers. In particular, hECM, but not collagen, increases mRNA expression of HB-EGF and colon stem cell marker leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5). Expression of these genes is not induced by hECM depleted of the heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans. Lastly, a specific cell population positive for cancer stem cell (CSC) markers LGR5, epCAM and CD133, but negative for CD44, appears after 7 days culture on hECM, a population which is reduced by 50 % in cells grown on heparan sulfated-depleted hECM. Collectively, the data suggest that hECM induces growth factors and receptors regulating proliferation of metastatic CRC in the liver and offers a growth advantage for specific populations expressing CSC markers.
