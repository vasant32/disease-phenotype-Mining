 BACKGROUND: The putative association between serum adiponectin levels and colorectal adenomas is actually under debate. The aim of this study was to investigate this association in relation to factors known to influence the levels of adiponectin such as anthropometric, metabolic, inflammatory parameters as well as lifestyle individual characteristics. METHODS: 40 patients with adenomas and 40 controls were enrolled. Body weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressure were recorded. Fasting plasma glucose, lipids, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin levels were measured. Metabolic Syndrome was defined and lifestyle characteristics assessed. RESULTS: No differences were found in adiponectin values between patients and controls (p = 0.101). Adiponectin levels were significantly higher in females than in males (p = 0.004). Adiponectin levels did not result in significant association with colorectal adenomas even after adjustment for metabolic and life style parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not confirm the hypothesis that high levels of adiponectin confer decreased risk of colorectal adenomas.
