The risk factors, influencing late results of surgical treatment, were analyzed in 69 patients, suffering a colorectal cancer hepatic metastases. The significance of clinico-morphological (the metastases maximal size, quantity, localization, the tumor grade, the hepatic affection synchronicity with primary tumor appearance, the hepatoduodenal ligament lymph nodes affection, microvascular invasion, the resection edges) and molecular (CK 20, beta-cat, Ki 67, Muc 2 and 5A) factors of prognosis was studied up. The hepatic resection variant was chosen, depending on the largest metastasis size present, the tumor nodes quantity and localization, the extrahepatic foci present, the lymph nodes affection and hepatic functional reserve secured. Basing on estimation of the level and type of expression for molecular factors there was determined correlation with the tumor recurrence rate. High degree correlation was established for the CK 20, beta-cat, Ki 67 expression and the recurrence rate, but it was not true for the Muc 2 and 5A expression. One, three and five years have survived 85, 50 and 31% of patients accordingly, and without recurrences--68, 27 and 14% accordingly. No one of clinico-morphological factors, but the metastasis grade, have had influenced the disease prognosis.
