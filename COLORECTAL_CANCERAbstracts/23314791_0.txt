 BACKGROUND: The objective of this retrospective study was to assess the survival of patients after resection of hepatic and pulmonary colorectal metastases to identify predictors of long-term survival. METHODS: Patients receiving chemotherapy alone were compared to patients receiving surgery and chemotherapy in a matched-pair analysis with the following criteria: UICC stage, grading, and date of initial primary tumor occurrence. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients with liver and lung metastases of colorectal carcinoma underwent resection. In 20 cases, complete resection was achieved (median survival, 67 months). Incomplete resection and preoperatively elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels are independent risk factors for reduced survival. Patients developing pulmonary metastases prior to hepatic metastases had the worst prognosis. Surgical resection significantly increased survival compared to chemotherapy alone in matched-pair analysis (65 vs. 30 months, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete resection and elevated CEA levels are predictors of poor outcome. Matched-paired analysis confirmed that surgical resection in combination with chemotherapy appears to be superior to chemotherapy alone.
