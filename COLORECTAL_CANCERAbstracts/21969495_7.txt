 PURPOSE: In a multicenter, double-blind phase II trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of perifosine plus capecitabine (P-CAP) with placebo plus capecitabine (CAP) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who had progressed after as many as two prior therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 38) not previously treated with capecitabine received P-CAP (perifosine 50 mg orally once daily, days 1 to 21 and CAP 825 mg/m(2) orally twice daily, days 1 to 14) or CAP (825 mg/m(2) orally twice daily, days 1 to 14) in 21-day cycles until disease progression. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), safety, and tolerability. RESULTS: Twenty patients were randomly assigned to P-CAP and 18 to CAP. Median TTP (27.5 v 10.1 weeks; P < .001) and median OS (17.7 v 7.6 months; P = .0052) were improved in patients receiving P-CAP versus CAP. ORR was 20% v 7% in the P-CAP and CAP groups, respectively, and one patient in the P-CAP group had a complete response. A subset analysis of fluorouracil-refractory patients showed a median TTP of 17.6 v 9.0 weeks (P < .001) and median OS of 15.1 v 6.5 months (P = .0061). Toxicities, including diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and hand-foot syndrome, were manageable. CONCLUSION: P-CAP showed promising clinical activity compared with CAP in previously treated patients with mCRC. A phase III trial is underway comparing P-CAP with CAP in patients with refractory mCRC.
