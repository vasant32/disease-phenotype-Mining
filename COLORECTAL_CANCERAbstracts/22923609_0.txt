Meprinα, an astacin-type metalloprotease is overexpressed in colorectal cancer cells and is secreted in a non-polarized fashion, leading to the accumulation of meprinα in the tumor stroma. The transition from normal colonocytes to colorectal cancer correlates with increased meprinα activity at primary tumor sites. A role for meprinα in invasion and metastatic dissemination is supported by its pro-angiogenic and pro-migratory activity. In the present study, we provide evidence for a meprinα-mediated transactivation of the EGFR signaling pathway and suggest that this mechanism is involved in colorectal cancer progression. Using alkaline phosphatase-tagged EGFR ligands and an ELISA assay, we demonstrate that meprinα is capable of shedding epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) from the plasma membrane. Shedding was abrogated using actinonin, an inhibitor for meprinα. The physiological effects of meprinα-mediated shedding of EGF and TGFα were investigated with human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). Proteolytically active meprinα leads to an increase in EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and subsequently enhances cell proliferation and migration. In conclusion, the implication of meprinα in the EGFR/MAPK signaling pathway indicates a role of meprinα in colorectal cancer progression.
