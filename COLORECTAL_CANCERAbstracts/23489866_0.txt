AIM: Annexin A2 (ANXA2) is known to be a tumorigenic molecule and is highly expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC). Its diagnostic and prognostic value is not fully understood. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between ANXA2 expression, clinicopathological characteristics, tumour recurrence, and survival. METHOD: Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate ANXA2 expression in 150 matched samples from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Overall survival and recurrence were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine independent factors contributing to survival and recurrence. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and liner correlation analysis was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of ANXA2 expression for clinical diagnosis. RESULTS: ANXA2 was found to be strongly expressed in poorly differentiated tumours (p < 0.001), late stage (p = 0.020) and lymph node positivity (p = 0.002). ANXA2 expression was significantly related to recurrence (p < 0.001) and survival (p = 0.002). Cox proportional hazards model indicated that ANXA2 expression (p < 0.001, HR=1.366, 95%CI 1.232-1.515) and tumour location (p = 0.039, HR=1.891, 95%CI 1.034-3.456) were independent factors in predicting overall survival while ANXA2 expression (p < 0.001, HR=1.445, 95%CI 1.222-1.709) were independent factors predicting recurrence. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) (AUC=0.768, 95%CI=0.642-0.894) and liner correlation analysis suggested ANXA2 was suitable for the clinical diagnosis of CRC. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that ANXA2 is a biomarker with diagnostic and prognostic potential for patients with CRC. © 2013 The Authors.
