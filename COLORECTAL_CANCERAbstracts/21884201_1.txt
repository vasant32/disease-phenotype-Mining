 AIMS:  To assess the prevalence of keratin 7 (K7) expression in colorectal cancer and to correlate findings with clinicopathological parameters and patients' outcome. METHOD AND RESULTS: A total of 370 patients were evaluated for K7 expression by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray technique. K7 expression was scored semiquantitatively as either focal (<10%), moderate (10-50%) or extensive (>50%). In all, 32 (9%) tumours were immunoreactive for K7, with five cases showing extensive, four moderate and 23 focal expression, respectively. K7 expression was associated with poor tumour differentiation (P = 0.005) and the extent of tumour budding (P = 0.02). In whole sections, K7 immunoreactivity prevailed in single cells and small clusters of cells at the invasion front. Analysis of serial sections showed that K7-positive cells colocalized with keratin 20, whereas they lacked immunoreactivity for E-cadherin, MUC2 and MIB-1. Disease progression occurred in 52% of patients with K7-positive tumours and 41% with K7-negative tumours (P = 0.19); 48% of patients with K7-positive tumours but only 33% with K7-negative tumours died of disease (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant expression of K7 in budding cancer cells represents a modification of the epithelial phenotype ('epithelial-epithelial transition': EET) which may be linked to gains in motility and invasive potential.
