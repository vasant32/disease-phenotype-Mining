Tumor necrosis factor superfamily members, including Fas ligand and TRAIL, have been studied extensively for cancer therapy, including as components of gene therapy. We examined the use of FasL expression to achieve tumor-selective replication of an oncolytic poxvirus (vFasL), and explored its biology and therapeutic efficacy for FasR- and FasR+ cancers. Infection of FasR+ normal and MC38 cancer cells by vFasL led to abortive viral replication owing to acute apoptosis and subsequently showed both reduced pathogenicity in non-tumor-bearing mice and reduced efficacy in FasR+ tumor-bearing mice. Infection of FasR- B16 cancer cells by vFasL led to efficient viral replication, followed by late induction of FasR and subsequent apoptosis. Treatment with vFasL as compared with its parental virus (vJS6) led to increased tumor regression and prolonged survival of mice with FasR- cancer (B16) but not with FasR+ cancer (MC38). The delayed induction of FasR by viral infection in FasR- cells provides for potential increased efficacy beyond the limit of the direct oncolytic effect. FasR induction provides one mechanism for tumor-selective replication of oncolytic poxviruses in FasR- cancers with enhanced safety. The overall result is both a safer and more effective oncolytic virus for FasR- cancer.
