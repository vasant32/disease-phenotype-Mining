 BACKGROUND: The role of laparoscopy in two-stage hepatectomy for bilobar colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) has not yet been extensively investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed a prospectively collected database of 302 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic liver resection at our institution between 2003 and 2011. RESULTS: Eight patients undergoing laparoscopic first/second-stage hepatectomy for bilobar CRLMs (male/female 6:2; median age, 64 years) were analyzed. The first stage consisted of laparoscopic clearance of the left lobe in all patients with no postoperative morbidity and mortality. Seven patients underwent portal vein embolization or ligation. The median interval between first- and second-stage hepatic resections was 89 days (range, 36-123 days). Second-stage hepatectomy with right lobar clearance (open, n=5; laparoscopic, n=2; laparoscopic to open, n=1) was associated with no mortality and an operative morbidity rate of 50%. Adhesions were judged to be minimal or absent during the second-stage procedure. Complications included intra-abdominal collection (n=2), bleeding requiring re-operation (n=1), and bile leak (n=1). R0 resection was obtained in 7 of 8 cases after first-stage resection and in 8 of 8 cases after second-stage resection. Three patients (38%) died from disease recurrence. Of the remaining 5 patients, 4 are disease-free at a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 9-27 months). CONCLUSIONS: The well-recognized advantages of laparoscopy may play a favorable role in the management of patients with bilobar CRLMs candidate for a two-stage resection. The first-stage laparoscopic clearance of the left lobe could progressively become the "gold standard." Laparoscopic second-stage hepatectomy should be limited to selected cases.
