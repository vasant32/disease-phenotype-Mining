 BACKGROUND:   A substantial percentage of patients with colorectal cancer present with obstructive symptoms. In such patients, surgery is often required and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Colorectal stenting is an increasingly commonplace alternative with potentially fewer risks than open surgery. We present our clinical experience over an 8-year period with colorectal stenting in a major tertiary Australian hospital. METHODS:   From 2000 to 2008, patients undergoing colorectal stenting were identified via medical records. Clinical data collected included patient demographics, tumour type, extent of metastatic disease, stent characteristics, technical and clinical success, acute and chronic complications, and long-term follow-up status. RESULTS:   Thirty-five patients (69 ± 13 years, 25 male) received a total of 39 stents. Technical success was achieved in 37 (95%), and clinical relief of obstruction was achieved in 34 (89%). One case was complicated by perforation at the time of procedure and three cases experienced delayed perforation. Reintervention was required in 17% of patients, all of whom had less than 50% hepatic volume replacement by metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS:   Colorectal stenting is a feasible and safe alternative for patients presenting with obstructive symptoms but the benefit may be restricted to patients with a short expected survival.
