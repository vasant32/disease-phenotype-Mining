 AIM: Cholecystectomy has been suggested as a risk factor for colorectal cancer. However, the association of cholecystectomy and the risk of colorectal adenoma (CRA) remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies to explore this relationship. METHODS: We identified studies by a literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE through 30 September 2011, and by searching the reference lists of pertinent articles. Summary relative risks (SRRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q statistic and the I2. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies (including 4061 CRA cases) were included in this meta-analysis. Analysis of these 10 studies found that no effect of cholecystectomy on the risk of CRAs was shown (SRR, 1.17; 95% CI: 0.93-1.48), with no significant heterogeneity among these studies (P heterogeneity=0.106, I2=37.9%). This null association was seen in both men and women (men: SRR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.58-1.73; women: SRR=1.39, 95% CI: 0.95-2.04). CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that there is no positive association between previous cholecystectomy and the risk of CRA development in both men and women.
