In this multicenter phase Ib study, drozitumab was given in combination with the mFOLFOX6 regimen and bevacizumab in patients with previously untreated, locally advanced recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer on day 1 of every 14-day cycle. Nine patients were treated at 2 different cohort dose levels of drozitumab. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred at either dose level and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Two patients had a partial response of 4.93 and 4.96 months duration. Cohort 2 dose level is the recommended starting dose level for future trials.
