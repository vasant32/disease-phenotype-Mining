 OBJECTIVE: To explore the roles of hairy enhancer of split 1 (Hes1) gene in colorectal cancer and analyze its clinical significance. METHODS: A total of 146 cases with colorectal cancer at our hospital were collected prospectively and followed up. There were 84 males and 62 females with an average age of (61 ± 11) years old. Tissue microarray was prepared and the expression of Notch signal genes were detected by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The differential expressions of Hes1 were significant among various types [negative or weakly positive: 8% (12/146), positive(+): 77% (112/146), positive(++): 15% (22/146)]. Among all, 134 were followed up successfully for an average duration of (42 ± 13) months. According to the Kaplan-Meier life curve, the overall 1, 3 and 5-year survival rates were 93% (136/146), 74% (108/146) and 67% (98/146) respectively. The long-term survival rate was correlated with TNM stage and pathological types (all P = 0.000), but not with Hes1 (P = 0.267). CONCLUSION: The expression of Hes1 is correlated with pathological types and differentiation types. However the long-term survival rate is not correlated with its expression.
