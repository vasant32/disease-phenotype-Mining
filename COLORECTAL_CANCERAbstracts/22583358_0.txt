In colorectal carcinoma, pathological assessment of tumors is essential for determining therapy and prognosis of the disease. Molecular associations of tumor complexity index and genetic alternations can be helpful to understand the tumor progression mechanism. Oncogenic K-ras is one of the major colorectal cancer associated genes, and is mutated in up to 50% of colorectal cancers. In this current study, we correlated tumor complexity index with mutations in K-ras codon 12, 13, and 61 in association with different clinicopathological parameters such as TNM stage, localization, sex, and age. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks from colon cancer samples was selected from 88 patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. Mutations in the K-ras gene were detected using pyrosequencing technique. Tumor complexity index was calculated using immunohistochemically stained images of the tumor outline of the specimens and then analyzing these pictures using Photoshop CS, Fovea Pro, and Image J computer programs. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS. K-ras mutations were detected in 17 (19.3%) colon cancer samples. Most of the samples were at a lower complexity index. No correlation was observed between K-ras mutations and complexity index. However, K-ras mutations were correlated with regional lymph node metastasis and tumor stages and complexity index with tumor wall penetration. In conclusion, complexity index and K-ras mutations are independent events; however, both correlate with tumor progression and are important in the biologic development of colon carcinoma.
