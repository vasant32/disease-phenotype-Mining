 BACKGROUND: Liver and lung metastases are the predominant cause of colorectal cancer (CRC)-related mortality. Chemokine-receptor pairs have a critical role in determining the metastatic progression of tumours. Our hypothesis was that disruption of CXCR7/CXCR7 ligands axis could lead to a decrease in CRC metastases. METHODS: Primary tumours and metastatic tissues from patients with CRC were tested for the expression of CXCR7 and its ligands. Relevance of CXCR7/CXCR7 ligands for CRC metastasis was then investigated in mice using small pharmacological CXCR7 antagonists and CRC cell lines of human and murine origins, which - injected into mice - enable the development of lung and liver metastases. RESULTS: Following injection of CRC cells, mice treated daily with CXCR7 antagonists exhibited a significant reduction in lung metastases. However, CXCR7 antagonists failed to reduce the extent of liver metastasis. Moreover, there were subtle differences in the expression of CXCR7 and its ligands between lung and liver metastases. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the activation of CXCR7 on tumour blood vessels by its ligands may facilitate the progression of CRC within lung but not within liver. Moreover, we provide evidence that targeting the CXCR7 axis may be beneficial to limit metastasis from colon cancer within the lungs.
