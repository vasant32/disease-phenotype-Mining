 AIM: To investigate the association of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) C-509T polymorphism and susceptibility to cancer by means of meta-analysis. METHODS: An extensive search was performed to identify eligible case-control studies investigating such a link. The strength of the association between TGF-β1 C-509T polymorphism and cancer risk was assessed by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95%confidence intervals (95%CIs) in fixed or random effects models. RESULTS: 55 published case-control studies with a total number of 21,639 cases and 28,460 controls were included. Overall, there was no association between TGF-β1 C-509T and cancer risk in all genetic comparison models (TT vs. CC: OR=1.01, 95%CI=0.89-1.15; T vs. C: OR=1.01, 95%CI=0.94-1.07). However, a stratified analysis by cancer type indicated -509 T allele was significantly associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) (TT vs. CT/CC: OR=0.85, 95%CI=0.76-0.95), especially for Caucasians (TT vs. CT/CC: OR=0.83, 95%CI=0.71-0.98) and for population-based studies (TT vs. CT/CC: OR=0.78, 95%CI=0.68- 0.89). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggested that TGF-β1 C-509T polymorphism might contribute to a decreased risk on colorectal cancer susceptibility, especially for Caucasians.
