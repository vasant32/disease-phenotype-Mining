 OBJECTIVE: Several studies have implicated primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) as an additional risk factor for colorectal neoplasia in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Some reports have indicated that the risk is even higher in PSC-IBD patients after liver transplantation (Ltx), but this issue is controversial. We aimed to compare the risk of colorectal neoplasia in PSC-IBD patients before and after Ltx and to identify risk factors for colorectal neoplasia post-transplant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a multicenter study within the Nordic Liver Transplant Group, we assessed the risk of colorectal neoplasia by using the competing risk regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the 439 PSC patients included, 353 (80%) had IBD at the time of Ltx and 15 (3%) patients developed de novo IBD post-Ltx. The median duration of IBD was 15 (0-50) years at the time of Ltx and follow-up after Ltx was 5 (0-20) years. Ninety-one (25%) PSC-IBD patients developed colorectal neoplasia. The cumulative risk of colorectal neoplasia was higher after than before Ltx (HR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.9, p = 0.002). A multivariate analysis demonstrated aminosalicylates and ursodeoxycholic acid as significantly associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia post-Ltx. Duration and activity of IBD did not significantly affect the risk of neoplasia. CONCLUSION: The even higher risk of colorectal neoplasia in PSC-IBD patients after when compared with that of before Ltx underscores the importance of regular surveillance colonoscopies post-Ltx. The association of aminosalicylates and ursodeoxycholic acid to the development of colorectal neoplasia after Ltx should be further investigated.
