 BACKGROUND: To report our prospective experience on the incidence and pattern of oxaliplatin (OXA)-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXA-IPN) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with either FOLFOX-4 or XELoda + OXaliplatin (XELOX). PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty patients scheduled to be treated with either FOLFOX or XELOX for CRC were prospectively monitored at baseline and followed-up during chemotherapy. The incidence and severity of symptoms secondary to OXA-IPN were recorded using three different types of assessment, i.e. the motor and neurosensory National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria, version 3.0 (NCI-CTCv3), the clinical version of the total neuropathy score (TNSc) and electrophysiological scores. RESULTS: Patients treated with either FOLFOX-4 or XELOX manifested similar incidence rates and severities of acute OXA-IPN. However, FOLFOX-4 was associated with increased incidence of chronic neurotoxicity, compared with XELOX-treated patients (n = 64/77 versus 44/73; P = 0.002), at a very similar OXA median cumulative dose during both regimens. Both the NCI-CTCv3 and TNSc demonstrated that the severity of cumulative OXA-IPN in FOLFOX-4-treated patients is higher than in those treated with XELOX. CONCLUSION: The incidence of acute neurotoxicity during FOLFOX-4 therapy is similar to XELOX. However, it seems that FOLFOX-4 is more neurotoxic than XELOX in terms of cumulative OXA-IPN, despite comparable OXA cumulative dose.
