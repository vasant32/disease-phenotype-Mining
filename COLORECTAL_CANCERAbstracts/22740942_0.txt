Common methods for identifying cancer-related genes are solely based on differences between gene frequencies in the disease and control groups, and do not take into account the age of onset in the gene carriers. In the present investigation, we developed a new study design based on the age of onset of cancer for the identification of colorectal cancer-related genes. The samples from patients with colorectal cancer were typed using an HLA-DQB1 polymerase chain reaction using a sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) typing kit. The mean age of subjects with and without the alleles was calculated. The mean age of subjects with the HLA-DQB1*02 allele was significantly less than that of subjects without this allele (p<0.05). We found that the HLA-DQB1*02 allele was associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility. This new method of analysis may therefore be an efficient and reliable approach for the identification of cancer-causing genes.
