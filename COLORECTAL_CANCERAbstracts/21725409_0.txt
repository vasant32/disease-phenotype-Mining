 AIM: To identify the time taken from referral to first treatment of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) in the Auckland region and benchmark these against available guidelines for timeliness. METHOD: Retrospective study of clinical records of all patients diagnosed with CRC identified from the national registry and Auckland regional databases in the years 2001 and 2005. Data extracted included demographics, dates and types of interventions and the patient journey from referral to initiation of first treatment. RESULTS: Of the 1128 patients diagnosed and treated in these cohorts, 68% were referred through their general practitioner and 58% saw a surgeon at their first specialist appointment. Seventy-nine percent received initial treatment with curative intent. The median time from initial referral to first treatment was 35 days, with only 68% of patients being treated within 62 days of initial referral. CONCLUSION: The colorectal patient journey is complicated by multiple pathways of presentation and treatment and by patient choice. These factors need to be considered when assessing the acceptability of transit times based on summary data. That nearly one-third of patients did not complete the United Kingdom-based target of 62 days from referral to first treatment indicates there is a need for further improvement in service delivery for patients developing CRC in the Auckland region.
