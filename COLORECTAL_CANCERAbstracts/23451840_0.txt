 AIM: Twelve to thirty % of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and relatives with an increased familial risk of CRC are referred for preventive measures. New guidelines recommend genetic counselling for high-risk families and surveillance colonoscopy for moderate-risk families. Assessment of familial risk of CRC and referral rates for these preventive measures were determined 1 year after the introduction of new guidelines. METHOD: Assessment of familial risk of CRC and referral for preventive measures were measured in clinical practice among 358 patients with CRC in 18 hospitals using medical records and questionnaires. Additionally, a knowledge survey was performed among 312 clinicians. RESULTS: Sixty-seven % of patients with an increased familial risk (n = 65/97) were referred for preventive measures, as were 23% (61/261) of low-risk patients. The uptake of genetic counselling in high-risk families was 33% (12/36). The uptake of surveillance colonoscopy in moderate-risk families was 34% (21/61). In the knowledge survey clinicians correctly determined familial risk in 55% and preventive measures in 65% of cases. CONCLUSION: Currently 67% of individuals with an increased familial risk of CRC were referred for preventive measures. Only one-third were referred in accordance with guidelines.
