Matrix metalloproteinase-7 is capable of degrading many extracellular matrix proteins and cellular adhesions. In many malignancies, it is overexpressed, and it plays a role in cancer progression by enhancing tumor invasion and thereby metastatic potential. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between MMP-7 tissue expression and prognosis in colorectal cancer. From 623 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer, surgical specimens were collected into tissue array blocks and stained by immunohistochemistry for MMP-7. Specimens from 545 patients were suitable for analysis. In specimens from 105 patients (19.3%), MMP-7 scored as high; in 103 (18.9%), as moderate; and in 134 (24.9%), as mild. In 203 cases (37.2%), immunoreactivity was negative. A significant correlation appeared between MMP-7 immunoexpression and tumor differentiation. High MMP-7 positivity associated with poor prognosis during a 5-year follow-up. During longer follow-up, the differences in survival between groups disappeared. MMP-7 is a potential target for tumor therapy, which should be evaluated in clinical trials.
