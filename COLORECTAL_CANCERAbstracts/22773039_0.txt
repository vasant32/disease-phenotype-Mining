We had reported that MSP58 regulates colorectal cancer cell proliferation, development, and apoptosis, by the cyclin D1-cyclin-dependent kinase 4-p21 pathway. In this study, MSP58 protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 499 specimens of CRC. The relationship between various clinicopathological features and overall patient survival rate was analyzed. The association of MSP58 expression with the 499 CRC patients' survival rate was assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Using ROC curve to provide sensitivity and specificity of the score of MSP58 predicts local recurrence and survival of CRC patients. The expression of MSP58 was positively correlated with the depth of invasion (P < 0.001), local recurrence (P = 0.008), tumor grade (P = 0.002), and UICC stage (P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that the survival time of CRC patients with low expression of MSP58 was longer than those with high expression during the 5-year follow-up period (P < 0.001). COX regression analysis indicated that high expression of MSP58 (P < 0.001), depth of invasion >pT(1) (P = 0.008), distant organ metastasis (pM(1)) (P < 0.001), regional lymph node metastasis (â‰¥ pN(1)) (P < 0.001), and local recurrence (Yes) (P = 0.007) were independent, poor prognostic factors of CRC. ROC curve showed the score of MSP58 expression level did provide a maximal sensitivity and specificity to predict local recurrence and survival of CRC patients. Our results demonstrated MSP58 might serve as a novel prognostic marker that is independent of, and additive to, the UICC staging system.
