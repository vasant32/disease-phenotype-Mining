 BACKGROUND: Resection of hepatic metastases is indicated in selected stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. A minority will eventually develop pulmonary metastases and may undergo lung surgery with curative intent. The aims of the present study were to assess clinical outcome and identify parameters predicting survival after pulmonary metastasectomy in patients who underwent prior resection of hepatic CRC metastases. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 27 consecutive patients (median age 62 years; range: 33-75 years) who underwent resection of pulmonary metastases after previous hepatic metastasectomy from CRC in two institutions from 1996 to 2009. All patients underwent complete resection (R0) for both colorectal and hepatic metastases. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 32 months (range: 3-69 months) after resection of lung metastases and 65 months (range: 19-146 months) after resection of primary CRC. Three- and 5-year overall survival rates after lung surgery were 56 and 39%, respectively, and median survival was 46 months (95% CI 35-57). Median disease-free survival after pulmonary metastasectomy was 13 months (95% CI 5-21). At the time of last follow-up, seven patients (26%) had no evidence of recurrent disease and 6 of these 7 patients presented initially with a single lung metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Resection of lung metastases from CRC patients may result in prolonged survival, even after previous hepatic metastasectomy. Yet, prolonged disease-free survival remains the exception, and seems to occur only in patients with a single lung lesion.
