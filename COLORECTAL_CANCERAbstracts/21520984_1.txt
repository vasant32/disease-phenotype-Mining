Slovak (SR) and Czech (CR) Republics reach up the highest recorded incidence rates of colorectal cancer. In analysis of the development and changes in colorectal cancer incidence in the above-mentioned countries, it was reported the most considerable incidence increase of the disease in males in the SR, then in males in the CR, subsequently in females in the SR and the slowest incidence rate was reported in females in the CR. Colorectal cancer mortality increased most rapidly in males in the SR, then in males in the CR, slower increase was reported in females in the SR and in females in the CR the mortality was in the long term stabilized. In both countries and both sexes clinical stage II is noted most frequently, also the decrease of the disease number in the clinical stage I and in undefined stage, and a slight decrease in other clinical stages. The trends in risk factors of colorectal cancer in the SR and CR would support the hypotheses of the later culmination of incidence and on the higher levels than in other developed countries. The purpose of this study is to analyse the character and changes in development of incidence, mortality and clinical stages of colorectal cancer (1980-2005) and to assess the influence of selected risk factors on the highest disease incidence in above-mentioned two Central European countries.
