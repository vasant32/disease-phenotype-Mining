 INTRODUCTION: Galectin-3 is an endogenous galactose-binding protein that is expressed in a wide range of normal and neoplasic tissues and is thought to be involved in cellular adhesion, growth regulation, and apoptosis. Galectin-3 seems to have an important role in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunoexpression of galectin-3 in patients with colorectal cancer under surgery and chemotherapy treatment and the relationship of galectin-3 expression and clinical aspects or tumor evolution. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Galectin-3 expression was examined immunohistochemically in 75 samples of colorectal tissues. A scoring system was used to evaluate the cytoplasmic cells color. Among the patients, 40 were female; the average age was 61.98 years old. According to the site, 42.6% was of the rectum, 33.4% right colon, and 24% left colon. Thirty-three tumors were stage II, 32 stage III, and ten stage IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Galectin-3 immunoexpression was classified as 1 in 57.33% of tumors. The highest percentage of staining cells appeared in the most advanced cancer (p = 0.4899). Patients with recurrence had a great number of tumors with high score (p = 0.0465). In addition, high or moderate galectin-3 immunoexpression had been associated with an increased marginal risk for death (p = 0.0795). The immunoexpression of galectin-3 was strong or moderate in 42% of the colorectal tumors. Patients with strong or moderate immunoexpression of galectin-3 died or had recurrence more frequently. The risk of death was marginally reduced in patients with negative or low-grade galectin-3. Galectin-3 cytoplasmatic immunoexpression seems to be a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer because a higher risk of recurrence had been observed in tumors with a high score of galectin-3. However, a higher risk of death was not found on this group.
