Colorectal cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in Germany. Following the nationwide introduction of the screening colonoscopy at the age of 55 years, more patients are currently diagnosed at an earlier and therefore potential curable stage. The aim for the coming years will be to further accelerate the acceptance of colorectal cancer screening. Furthermore, the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer has become more effective due to interdisciplinary approaches as well as the introduction of new anti-cancer drugs. The current comprehensive treatment standards were communicated in the form of a guideline in 2008. This article will summarise the most important standards for colorectal cancer screening as well as for treatment and follow-up as a guide for insurance purposes.
