 AIM: to asses the role of Microsomal Glutathione S-Transferase1 (MGST1) gene as one of enzym metabolism that plays in enviromental factor. METHODS: using case-control study, subjects with age less than 50 years were collected from teaching hospital Makassar between 2008-2010. Frozen or routinely processed tumour samples biopsy and peripheral blood were obtained from 35 CRC patients undergoing surgery and endoscopic examination with 61 subject as control. CRC cases were diagnosis by clinical examination and confirm by histopathology without familial aggregation of CRC. DNA resequencing was conducted for the 3 kb genomic DNA region MGST1 using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: from 96 subject, two varian single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 16454T>G and 16416G>A MGST1 were identified. Significant CRC association (p= 0.047) was detected in GG genotipe SNP 16454T>G MGST1 with 3.5 fold risk (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.962-13.191). CONCLUSION: the results suggest that MGST1 gene polymorphisms as one of environment gene may contribute to CRC risk in younger age (<50 years old).
