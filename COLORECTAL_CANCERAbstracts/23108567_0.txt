 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancers (CRCs) with wild-type KRAS respond to EGFR-targeted antibody treatment. Analysis of the hotspot clustered mutations in codons 12 and 13 is compulsory before therapy and no standardized methodology for that purpose has been established so far. Since these mutations may have different biological effects and clinical outcome, reliable frequency and types of KRAS mutations need to be determined for individual therapy. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to describe the KRAS mutation spectrum in a group of 481 Serbian mCRC patients and to compare the general performances of allele-specific PCR and reverse-hybridization assays. METHODS: KRAS testing was performed with two diagnostic analyses, DxS TheraScreen K-RAS PCR Kit and KRAS StripAssay™. RESULTS: KRAS mutations in codons 12 and 13 were present in 37.6 % of analyzed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) DNA samples. The seven most frequent mutation types were observed with both assays: p.G12D 34.6 %, p.G12V 24.9 %, p.G12A 10.3 %, p.G12C 8.1 %, p.G12S 5.4 %, p.G12R 1.6 %, and p.G13D 15.1 %. Regarding double mutants, 0.8 % of them were present among all tested samples and 2.2 % among KRAS mutated ones. CONCLUSIONS: Two screening approaches that were used in this study have been shown as suitable tests for detecting KRAS mutations in diagnostic settings. In addition, they appear to be good alternatives to methods presently in use. In our experience, both methods showed capacity to detect and identify double mutations which may be important for potential further subgrouping of CRC patients.
