Cytokine-induced expression of suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) molecules is important for the negative feedback control of STAT-dependent cytokine signalling. The aim of this study was to investigate possible association between the promoter region polymorphisms of the SOCS3 gene and metastatic colorectal carcinoma in a Turkish population. The DNA samples obtained from 103 patients and 109 healthy individuals were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and nucleotide sequence analysis. Five sets of primers designed for the SOCS3 gene were used, and we did not detect significant differences in genotype frequencies for any of these polymorphisms between the study groups. Only the S3P1 region showed polymorphism and displayed three (1,2,4, 2,3,4 and 2,4) genotypes. Interestingly, 2,3,4 genotype was observed in 3 patients, but not in controls. Moreover, the sequence analysis revealed that the nucleotides positioned at -914 and -1031â€‰nt had the polymorphisms. Nucleotide sequence analysis of SSCP band 1 and band 3 revealed C-914A (rs12953258) and T-1031C (rs111033850) polymorphisms, respectively. The T-1031C polymorphism lies in the border of the STAT-binding site. The T-1031C polymorphism (rs111033850) is a newly identified single nucleotide polymorphism with this study, and we submitted this to the NCBI database. However, these results suggested that there is no marked association between SOCS3 gene promoter region polymorphisms and the risk of developing metastatic colorectal cancer.
