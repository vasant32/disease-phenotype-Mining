This study examined demographic and lifestyle factors that influenced decisions and obstacles to being screened for colorectal cancer in low-income African Americans in three urban Tennessee cities. As part of the Meharry Community Networks Program (CNP) needs assessment, a 123-item community survey was administered to assess demographic characteristics, health care access and utilization, and screening practices for various cancers in low-income African Americans. For this study, only African Americans 50 years and older (n=460) were selected from the Meharry CNP community survey database. There were several predictors of colorectal cancer screening such as being married and having health insurance (P< .05). Additionally, there were associations between obstacles to screening and geographic region such as transportation and health insurance (P< .05). Educational interventions aimed at improving colorectal cancer knowledge and screening rates should incorporate information about obstacles and predictors to screening.
