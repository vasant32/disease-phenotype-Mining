Introduction: In patients with metastatic colorectal cancers, multimodal management and the use of biological agents such as monoclonal antibodies have had major positive effects on survival. The ability to predict which patients may be at 'high risk' of distant metastasis could have major implications on patient management. Histomorphological, immunohistochemical or molecular biomarkers are currently being investigated in order to test their potential value as predictors of metastasis. Areas covered: Here, the author reviews the clinical and functional data supporting the investigation of three novel promising biomarkers for the prediction of metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer: tumor budding, Raf1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1). Expert opinion: The lifespan of most potential biomarkers is short as evidenced by the rare cases that have successfully made their way into daily practice such as KRAS or microsatellite instability (MSI) status. Although the three biomarkers reviewed herein have the potential to become important predictive biomarkers of metastasis, they have similar hurdles to overcome before they can be implemented into clinical management: standardization and validation in prospective patient cohorts.
