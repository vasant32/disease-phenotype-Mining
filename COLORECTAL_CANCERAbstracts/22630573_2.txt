The Muir-Torre Syndrome is characterized by the clinical constellation of sebaceous neoplasms, keratoacanthomas, and internal malignancies caused by a defect in DNA mismatch repair. Another mismatch repair defect causes Turcot syndrome, which manifests with colorectal and central nervous system neoplasms. We wish to report a case in which the manifestations of both syndromes were observed in the same patient. We further discuss the possible genetic basis for this overlap.
