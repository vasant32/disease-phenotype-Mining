Efficacy of the-state-of-the-art modalities of systemic and regional chemo-infusion with oxalyplatin (FOLFOX) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) (162) was compared. Objective response to the former was 40.8%, to the latter--11.9% (p = 0.0002); survival before intrasplenic relapse--9 and 5 months, respectively, (p = 0.0005); overall survival before relapse (median 7 and 4 months, respectively, (p = 0.01). The rate of survival before intrasplenic relapse in the systemic chemo-infusion group was significantly higher (median 10.5 vs. 8.1 months, respectively, (p = 0.03). No significant differences in overall survival were reported (median 15 vs. 13 months, respectively, in the latter group (p = 0.72).
