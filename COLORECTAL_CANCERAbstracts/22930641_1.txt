The biological agents approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer - bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor A, along with cetuximab and panitumumab, two monoclonal antibodies that target the epidermal growth factor receptor - are associated with a number of adverse events that range in severity from relatively mild to potentially life threatening. Hypertension, thromboembolic events, proteinuria, bleeding, and gastrointestinal perforation have all been associated with bevacizumab, while dermatologic toxicities are common with cetuximab and panitumumab. Hypersensitivity reactions and hypomagnesemia are also a concern with cetuximab and panitumumab. The frequency of these adverse events in randomized clinical trials is reviewed, and recommendations for managing these events in patients undergoing treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer are provided.
