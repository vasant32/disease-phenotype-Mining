The outpatient-based study by Deng et al [World J Gastroenterol 2011 July 14; 17(26): 3133-3139] on the factors that may influence the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening feasibility, encouraged our curiosity. Establishing a simple method for quickly assessing the educational level of patients and modulating a questionnaire for each type of patient, may be an effective protocol to increase the people participation, mainly in countries where sufficient medical resources and financial support are lacking. In fact, the knowledge directly affects the feasibility when screening is offered. Patient educational level influences the understanding of the knowledge and the screening method. This factor may affect patient's priority level on the study participation, the understanding of questions, and the motivation to complete the questionnaire and, consequently, the screening success. Recent studies have found a relationship between high educational level and CRC screening participation, and emphasized the questionnaire ineffectiveness in the illiterate people. Although the questionnaire is an excellent method for this kind of evaluation, physician's contribution could be the most important factor associated with the screening method. Thus, further studies should be conducted to explore the compliance of patients with low educational level and to look for the best solutions for their enrollment.
