 BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that caffeine might be capable to prevent colon cancer development. This activity is linked in part to its anti-inflammatory properties mediated through modulation of immune responses. It was the aim of the study to evaluate the role of caffeine in the immune balance between peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and those of HT-29 and RKO human colon cancer lines. METHODS: Cytokine production was evaluated following incubation of the two types of cancer cells without and with three concentrations of caffeine. RESULTS: A concentration-dependent inhibition of TNFα and IFNγ secretion by PBMC was observed only after their stimulation by cancer cells. Reduction of the anti-inflammatory IL-1ra and IL-10 production was observed using higher caffeine concentrations only. CONCLUSION: We presume that by changing the equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in favor of anti-inflammation, caffeine may reduce the inflammatory process with a consequent suppression of colorectal cancer progress.
