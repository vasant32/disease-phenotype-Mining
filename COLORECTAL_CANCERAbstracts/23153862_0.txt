BACKGROUND: Our aims were to evaluate adherence to guidelines on colorectal cancer surveillance and outcomes for patients enrolled in an innovative follow-up program at our cancer center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Canada. Patients with stage II/III colorectal cancer who completed treatment and who entered into the program from December 1, 2007, to December 31, 2009, were identified. The minimum standard of care follow-up was defined as (1) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) testing every 120 days for 3 years; (2) computed tomography of chest, abdomen, and pelvis at 10 to 14 months and 22 to 26 months after surgery; and (3) colonoscopy within 14 months of surgery. RESULTS: A total of 408 patients met inclusion criteria. Two hundred (49.0%) patients were adherent to all 3 components of surveillance. Among all patients, 57 (14.0%) were nonadherent to computed tomography imaging, 135 (33.1%) were nonadherent to colonoscopy, and 96 (23.5%) were nonadherent to CEA testing. Determinants of nonadherence are described. In total, 192 (47.2%) patients had an abnormal surveillance investigation that led to 307 follow-up events. After a median of 1.6 years, 69 (16.9%) patients had documented tumor recurrence. Sixty-one (88.4%) of these 69 patients had recurrence diagnosed via surveillance, and 31 (44.9%) patients were considered potentially resectable. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated an improvement in CEA testing since the program began; however, adherence rates for all components are not yet optimal. Alterations to surveillance program management are outlined. Further investigation will determine whether intense follow-up improves patient survival locally.
