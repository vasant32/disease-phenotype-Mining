 OBJECTIVES: Interleukin-12 (IL-12) plays an important role in antitumor immunity. Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a novel IL-12 family member. The present studies demonstrate that IL-27 mediates potent antitumor activity. However, No studies have examined the association of these polymorphism with colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, we investigated the relationship of IL-12 and IL-27 gene polymorphisms and CRC. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed polymorphisms of IL-12 gene 16974 A/C and IL-27 gene -964 A/G, 2905 T/G, 4730 T/C in 410 patients with CRC and 450 controls, using PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-12 and IL-27 gene polymorphisms between the group of patients with CRC and the controls. Furthermore, no association was found between IL-12 family gene polymorphisms and different clinical stages in patients with CRC. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that IL-12 and IL-27 gene polymorphisms may not be involved in susceptibility to CRC.
