 OBJECTIVE: It is a challenge to differentiate invasive carcinomas from high-grade intraepithelial neoplasms in colonoscopy biopsy tissues. In this study, microRNA profiles were evaluated in the transformation of colorectal carcinogenesis to discover new molecular markers for identifying a carcinoma in colonoscopy biopsy tissues where the presence of stromal invasion cells is not detectable by microscopic analysis. METHODS: The expression of 723 human microRNAs was measured in laser capture microdissected epithelial tumours from 133 snap-frozen surgical colorectal specimens. Three well-known classification algorithms were used to derive candidate biomarkers for discriminating carcinomas from adenomas. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR was then used to validate the candidates in an independent cohort of macrodissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colorectal tissue samples from 91 surgical resections. The biomarkers were applied to differentiate carcinomas from high-grade intraepithelial neoplasms in 58 colonoscopy biopsy tissue samples with stromal invasion cells undetectable by microscopy. RESULTS: One classifier of 14 microRNAs was identified with a prediction accuracy of 94.1% for discriminating carcinomas from adenomas. In formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical tissue samples, a combination of miR-375, miR-424 and miR-92a yielded an accuracy of 94% (AUC=0.968) in discriminating carcinomas from adenomas. This combination has been applied to differentiate carcinomas from high-grade intraepithelial neoplasms in colonoscopy biopsy tissues with an accuracy of 89% (AUC=0.918). CONCLUSIONS: This study has found a microRNA panel that accurately discriminates carcinomas from high-grade intraepithelial neoplasms in colonoscopy biopsy tissues. This microRNA panel has considerable clinical value in the early diagnosis and optimal surgical decision-making of colorectal cancer.
