Few studies have examined barriers and facilitators to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among Hispanics, particularly sociocultural factors that may be relevant. This paper examines the influence of sociocultural factors on adherence to fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and colonoscopy. A survey was conducted among a sample of 400 low-income Hispanics in East Harlem, New York. Fatalism and health literacy were both significantly associated with colonoscopy screening adherence in bivariate models, though fatalism became non-significant and health literacy became less significant in multivariable models. With respect to adherence to colonoscopy or FOBT, both fatalism and health literacy were associated in bivariate models, though only fatalism remained significant in multivariable models (p=.03; OR: .94; 95% CI: .881-.992). These findings suggest fatalism and health literacy may play a role in shaping CRC screening adherence among low-income Hispanics. Researchers should continue investigating how sociocultural factors influence screening adherence among Hispanics, using larger and more geographically diverse samples.
