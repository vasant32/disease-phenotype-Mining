 PURPOSE: This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the usefulness of KÃ¶hne's index(KI) for predicting the efficacy of first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for unresectable liver metastases of colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 84 patients with unresectable liver metastases of colorectal cancer in whom first-line oxaliplatin- based chemotherapy was administered. The outcome of treatment was analyzed in relation to the KI. RESULTS: The patients were classified into 3 groups: high risk group (n=12), intermediate risk group (n=20), and low risk group (n=52). There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to response rate, disease control rate, disease-free survival, overall survival, and the rate of conversion to hepatic metastatectomy. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that KI might not be useful for predicting the efficacy of first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy for unresectable liver metastases of colorectal cancer.
