There is a significant gap between China and the optimal international level in terms of the treatment outcomes of colorectal cancer. In recent years, progresses have been made while limitations still exist in the management of colorectal cancer. Advances are seen including use of multi-disciplinary therapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiation, laparoscopic surgery and management of liver metastasis. Individualized therapy is also applied in colorectal cancer. However, randomized controlled trials based on Chinese population are still lacking. Radiation therapy is inadequate and standardization of surgical technique is to be improved. Although standardization of management of colorectal cancer has gained attention from the government, there is a long way to go. The establishment of subspecialty training and practice has not been satisfactory. National efforts are needed to improve the treatment outcomes of colorectal cancer in China.
