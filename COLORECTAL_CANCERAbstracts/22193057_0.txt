The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy and the dose dependent toxicity of camptothecin nanosuspension (Nano-CPT) comparing with that of topotecan (TPT). A novel supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process-high pressure homogenization technique has been developed to prepare Nano-CPT. The cytotoxicity of Nano-CPT and TPT was investigated against MCF-7, HCT-8, and PC-3 cell lines using MTT assay, antitumor activity in vivo were evaluated against HCT-8 xenograft model, and the dose dependent toxicity in vivo during the treatment were investigated by body weight changes and relative organ weight variations. The Nano-CPT presents about 6 times in vitro cytotoxicity active than TPT against cell lines MCF-7, nearly the same in vivo antitumor activity with TPT and lower toxicity. The results confirm that Nano-CPT is a novel potential formulation with high antitumor efficacy and low toxicity.
