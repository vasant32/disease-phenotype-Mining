The objective of the study was to evaluate the computed tomographic (CT) features and growth rates of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) on serial CT scans. The study included 17 patients (28 pulmonary metastases) who underwent metastasectomy from CRC. The characteristic CT features include well-defined round or oval nodules in the peripheral or subpleural/fissural lung with frequent feeding vessel sign. The mean tumor volume doubling time was calculated as 160 days. With these growth rates, short-term follow-up (i.e., 5-6 months) would be helpful.
