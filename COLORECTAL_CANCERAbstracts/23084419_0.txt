Fatigue and sleep disorders impact the quality of life of cancer patients. They do not put the vital prognosis at stake, but are debilitating and as a whole poorly treated.

Special emphasis is put on the necessary clinical work up, on various available scales, indexes, inventories, questionnaires and on actigraphy and polysomnography, on the semiology of these disorders, on their mechanisms and on the recent therapeutic methods which are still insufficiently distributed.
