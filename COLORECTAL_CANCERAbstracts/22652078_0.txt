Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin combination (XELOX) is the first-line treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer. Here we report a case of acute, severe but substantially reversible, neuromuscular and cardiac toxicity following XELOX chemotherapy. Muscle biopsy findings were consistent with a toxic myopathy with necrotizing features and vacuolar changes; COX-negative fibers were also present. The time course could support a main role for capecitabine, which may have some neurotoxic effects (more frequently central), but a detrimental interaction between the two drugs cannot be ruled out and further studies are needed.
