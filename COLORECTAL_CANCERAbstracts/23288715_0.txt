 BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leakage is a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality in the treatment of colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the modified double-stapling technique (MDST), as an alternative for conventional double-stapling technique (DST), and whether it could reduce the anastomotic leakage rate in laparoscopic anterior resection (Lapa-AR). STUDY DESIGN: Between March 2009 and October 2010, a total of 189 patients who underwent Lapa-AR for the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon or rectosigmoid colon were divided into the MDST group (n = 95) and the DST group (n = 94) according to the anastomotic technique. Data were analyzed retrospectively. Morbidity and anastomotic leakage rate were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Patient demographics, preoperative comorbidity, tumor size, stage, and operative details were comparable between the two groups. There was no difference in operation time between the two groups. The overall complication rate was significantly lower in the MDST group than in the DST group (3.2 vs. 10.6 %, p = 0.042), including anastomotic leakage rate (0 vs.4.6 %, p = 0.029). The anastomotic technique was the only factor associated with anastomotic leakage in univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative study demonstrates MDST to have better short-term outcome in reducing anastomotic leakage compared with DST. This technique could be an alternative approach to maximize the patients' benefit in laparoscopic anterior resection.
