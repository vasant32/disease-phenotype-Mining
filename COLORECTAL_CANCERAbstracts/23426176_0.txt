SMAD4 mutations and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) show the importance of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signalling in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Loss of SMAD4 has been implicated as a predictive marker in CRC. As activation of the BMP and TGF-β pathways leads to phosphorylation of SMAD1,5,8 and SMAD2,3, respectively, and both need SMAD4 for translocation to the nucleus, we aimed to investigate whether nuclear staining of pSMAD1,5,8 and pSMAD2, 3 can be used as predictive markers in CRC. A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed using tissue from 209 patients diagnosed with CRC. TMA was stained and scored for the nuclear presence of SMAD4, pSMAD2,3 and pSMAD1,5,8. Loss of SMAD4, pSMAD2,3 and pSMAD1,5,8 was observed in 40, 38 and 73% of the cases, respectively. The incidence of SMAD4 loss was significantly higher in the advanced stages. There was a correlation between loss of SMAD4 and loss of pSMAD1,5,8, but not between loss of SMAD4 and loss of pSMAD2,3. Loss of SMAD4 correlated with a poorer survival. Loss of one of the pSMADs did not correlate with a poorer outcome. Combining different SMAD stainings did not improve the prediction. SMAD4 expression is a prognostic marker in CRC. Nuclear expressions of pSMAD1,5,8 and pSMAD2,3 are not useful prognostic markers in CRC.
