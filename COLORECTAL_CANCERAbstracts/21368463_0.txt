 PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to retrospectively assess if arterial hypertension induced during treatment with bevacizumab was associated with the clinical outcome in advanced, recurrent colorectal cancer patients treated with first-line bevacizumab. SUBJECTS: 13 patients( 7 men and 6 women) with advanced, recurrent colorectal cancer were treated by mFOLFOX6 regimen with first-line bevacizumab from August 2008 to July 2009. The median age was 64. 4 years (51 to 79 years old) with 10 and 3 patients having a PS score of 0 and 1. All patients received bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks in association with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid according to the mFOLFOX6 regimen. RESULTS: 9 patients (69. 0%) had hypertension, while 5 patients developed grades 2-3 hypertension on bevacizumab. Patients with hypertension tended to have a better response rate and disease control rate than patients without hypertension. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab-induced hypertension may represent a prognostic factor for clinical outcome in advanced, recurrent colorectal cancer patients treated with first-line bevacizumab.
