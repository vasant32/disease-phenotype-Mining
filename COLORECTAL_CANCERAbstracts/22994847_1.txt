The aim of this study was to develop novel colon targeted mucoadhesive microspheres (MAMs) for site specific delivery of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to colon without the drug being released in the stomach or small intestine. MAMs were prepared using Assam Bora rice starch, a natural mucoadhesive polymer, by a double emulsion solvent evaporation method. The microspheres were characterized for their shape, size, surface morphology, size distribution, incorporation efficiency, and in vitro and in vivo drug release studies. The release study confirmed the insignificant release of 5-FU in physiological condition of stomach and small intestine and major drug release in the cecal content. In vivo release study of the optimized MAMs was compared with immediate release (IR) 5-FU. 5-FU was distributed predominantly in the upper GI tract from the IR, whereas 5-FU was distributed primarily to the lower part of the GI tract from the MAM formulation. Enhanced levels of liver enzymes were found in animals given IR 5-FU as well as augmented levels of serum albumin, creatinine, leucocytopenia and thrombocytopenia was also observed. Thus to sum up, it can be appropriately established that the 5-FU release pattern from MAMs exhibits slow and extended release over longer periods of time with reduced systemic side effects.
