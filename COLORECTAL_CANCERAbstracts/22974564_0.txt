In both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the secondary prevention of colorectal cancer basically relies on the histological detection of dysplasia. In inflammatory bowel diseases, dysplasia identifies the subgroup of patients eligible for stricter surveillance (or prophylactic colectomy). In clinical practice, a number of issues may influence the benefits of clinico-pathological surveillance for inflammatory bowel disease patients with dysplasia, including: sampling errors, inconsistent biopsy assessments, patients' compliance with follow-up requirements, and how heath care is organized. Even in such a multifaceted context, it has been demonstrated that dysplasia surveillance is effective in reducing colorectal cancer-related mortality and morbidity. This paper focuses on current issues concerning the histological assessment of inflammatory bowel disease-associated dysplastic lesions.
