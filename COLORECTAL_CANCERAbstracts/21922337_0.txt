 BACKGROUND: Recent population-based studies in Alberta, Canada, found that approximately 50% of patients with stage III colon or stages II/III rectal adenocarcinoma did not receive guideline-recommended treatment (surgery plus chemotherapy or chemoradiation); a primary reason was not having an oncologist consult. We assessed the relationship between the hospital where the surgery was performed and the probability of a patient not having an oncologist consult. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with stage III colon or stage II/III rectal adenocarcinoma between 2002 and 2005 in Alberta who had surgery were identified from the Alberta Cancer Registry and included in the study. Multivariable logistic regression modeling with hospitals as random effects was used to estimate cancer-type-specific odds ratios of not having an oncologist consult for each hospital, adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities, relative to the overall nonconsultation rate. RESULTS: Overall, 21% of stage III colon, 25% of stage II rectal, and 13% of stage III rectal adenocarcinoma patients did not have an oncologist consult. Rates varied appreciably across hospitals and between cancer types within hospitals, even after the case-mix adjustment (adjusted odds ratios of nonconsultation ranged from 0.4 to 8.1). Small hospitals that performed 12 or fewer surgeries had nearly 100% consultation rates. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in oncologist-consult rates, particularly for stage II rectal cancer patients, is concerning. We are presenting the findings to the surgical community and discussing interventions to improve oncologist-consult rates.
