Colorectal cancer (CRC) largely affects older individuals; almost half of cases occur in patients >75 years old. The incidence increases with advancing age, doubling every 7 years in patients aged â‰¥50 years. The medical and societal burdens of CRC will probably worsen over the coming decades as the number of older individuals (>70) continues to grow. No evidence-based guidelines are available for this age group, as older patients with CRC are generally excluded from randomized clinical trials and the fit ones who are recruited are not representative of the general elderly population. When feasible, surgery is the most successful treatment option for eradicating the primary lesion, as well as any metastases. The operative risk under elective conditions is not markedly different in older than in younger patients; however, the acute setting is to be avoided as it is associated with high operative death rates. Well-selected older patients can tolerate chemotherapy, but benefits need to be balanced against potentially limited life expectancy and reduced quality of life. The use of combination chemotherapy is an area of much controversy, but this treatment should not necessarily be withheld because of the age of the patient. Careful monitoring of toxicities and early intervention is essential in older patients undergoing chemotherapy.
