In order to inform efforts to increase screening rates for colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted a survey of Alabama primary care physicians regarding CRC screening practices, educational preferences, and perceptions of obstacles to screening. A mail survey of 2,378 Alabama physicians in Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, and Obstetrics & Gynecology was conducted. Many physicians are not fully up-to-date with current CRC screening practices that could improve patient compliance with screening guidelines. One example is the potential use of high-sensitivity stool tests, such as the fecal immunochemical test, instead of the no longer recommended low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood tests. In addition, enhanced multimedia and web-based approaches to educating physicians and patients could be more fully utilized. Further, greater use of health information technologies could increase screening rates. Enhancing primary care physicians' knowledge of screening modalities and increasing their use of electronic technology could significantly improve colorectal cancer screening outcomes.
