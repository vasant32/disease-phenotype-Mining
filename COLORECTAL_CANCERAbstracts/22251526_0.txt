 BACKGROUND/AIMS: To demonstrate the feasibility of solo laparoscopic colorectal resection (SLCR) is performed by the laparoscopist only. This study is an evaluation of the feasibility of SLCR for patients with colorectal cancer. METHODOLOGY: Fifty-one consecutive patients received SLCR from 2008 to 2009. The procedure was performed with four trocars and one laparoscopist. The short-term outcomes and complications were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 67 years (range 42-81). The median operating time for SLCR was 168 minutes (range 90-268). For one patient (1.96%) conversion to open surgery was required. Anastomotic leakage developed in 1 (1.96%) patient and ileus developed in 2 (3.9%). The median postoperative hospital stay was 8 (range 6-60) days without in-hospital deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, SLCR for patients with colorectal cancer is feasible and compares favorably with the standard technique. The diminished need for human operative assistance provides significant economic and organizational benefits.
