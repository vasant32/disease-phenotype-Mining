 UNLABELLED: Colorectal cancer is the most common malignant tumor of digestive tract with high mortality due to local reccurences and metastases. These are due to micrometastases undetected by classical microscopic examination of regional lymph nodes. Sentinel lymph node SLN technique in colorectal cancer may lead to identification of micrometastases using immunohistochemistry. METHODS: We present our experience in SLN mapping in colorectal cancer using a limphofil dye, on 52 patients. We present the patients selection criteria in the study, the technique of SLN detection. RESULTS: Identification of SLN was performed in 48 cases, it failed in 4 cases. In 27 cases, 1 SLN was identified, in 21 cases 2 SLN were found. In 4 cases the SLN were false negative. In 30 cases SLN were negative on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. In 14 cases, SLN were positive, 4 cases presented micrometastases confirmed only by immunohistochemical methods. CONCLUSION: SLN technique in colorectal cancer: - doesn't change the surgical approach regarding the regional lymphadenectomy; - can modify the tumor stadialization by detecting lymph nodes micrometastases; - increase the number of patients who can benefit from the adjuvant chemotherapy and therefore, it may improve the prognosis.
