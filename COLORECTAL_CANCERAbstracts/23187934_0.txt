Colorectal carcinoma is, through to its high rate of liver metastasis (mCRC), the second most cause of cancer death worldwide. Tumor resection represents the only potential cure. In cases of unresectable disease systemic chemotherapy (sCHT) remains the therapy of choice. Modern sCHT regimens including biological agents can induce tumor response that leads to curative surgery of initially unresectable mCRC. However, liver-directed therapy via hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) may produce higher response rates than sCHT. Herein we studied whether a HAI of cetuximab (CE) plus bevacizumab (BE) with or without oxaliplatin (OX) can inhibit tumor growth in a rat model. WAG/Rij rats underwent subcapsular hepatic tumor implantation. After 10 days animals received either HAI or sCHT of CE plus BE, OX or all three drugs. Saline-treated animals served as controls. Tumor growth was estimated at day 10 and 13. On day 13 liver and tumor tissue was studied histologically and immunohistochemically. In controls the tumors grew about 50 %. OX alone was not capable of inhibiting tumor growth. In contrast, CE plus BE given as HAI significantly reduced tumor growth compared to sCHT (p < 0.05). HAI of CE plus BE combined with OX yielded an even more pronounced inhibition of tumor growth. Immunohistochemistry revealed a decreased tumor cell proliferation and tumor vascularization. The present study demonstrates that HAI of CE plus BE is effective to inhibit tumor growth. This effect is even more pronounced in combination with OX. Systemic application of these agents cannot achieve comparable effects.
