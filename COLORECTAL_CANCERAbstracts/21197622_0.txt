 BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks vascular endothelial factor. It demonstrated an efficacy in many cancer types. The standard recommendation of administration is the 90-, 60-, and 30-min infusion sequence for all doses. We evaluated in this study the possibility of reducing infusion time to 10 min for bevacizumab given at 5 or 7.5 mg/kg in metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients who received bevacizumab for MCRC were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: Group A (bevacizumab was given in the 90-, 60-, and 30-min infusion sequence) and group B (bevacizumab was given over 10 min). Patients' medical records were used to identify any hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) possibly related to bevacizumab. RESULTS: There were 38 patients in group A and 43 in group B. In group A, 459 doses of bevacizumab were given (286 doses at 5 mg/kg and 173 doses at 7.5 mg/kg). No HSR occurred in this group. In group B, 527 doses of bevacizumab were given (335 doses at 5 mg/kg and 192 doses at 7.5 mg/kg). Only two events of HSR grade 2 were reported in the 7.5 mg/kg infusions. Both of them were easily resolved with symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab 5 or 7.5 mg/kg in MCRC can be infused safely over 10 min.
