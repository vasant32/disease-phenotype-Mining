Failure of anti-cancer therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells involves resistance to death mechanisms. We investigated grape seed extract (GSE) ability to target CRC cells and delineated the mechanisms involved in GSE-induced CRC cell death. GSE selectively induced apoptotic death in human CRC cells; efficacy increased as the metastatic potential of the cancer cells increased. Oxidative stress, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, modulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, and involvement of both caspase-dependent/independent apoptotic pathways contributed to GSE-induced CRC cell death. GSE intervention may serve as a multi-targeted CRC therapeutic capable of inducing selective cancer cell death.
