 AIM: The adenoma detection rate is an important quality indicator for colonoscopy, but recently, serrated polyps of the large bowel have been recognized as important premalignant lesions. As they are often more difficult to see than adenomas, the detection rate of serrated polyps is set to become a more stringent indicator of quality in colonoscopy than adenoma detection rate. Here we aim to provide preliminary data on serrated polyp detection. METHOD: This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data. Colonoscopies were stratified by one of six colorectal surgeons, each of whom had performed more than 1000 colonoscopies. Exams were separated by indication and the number of patients with at least one adenoma or one serrated polyp recorded. Time of withdrawal in normal examinations was noted. RESULTS: Eighteen thousand and three colonoscopies were included. Average completion rate was 96.3 ± 1.2%. Mean serrated detection rate for all examinations was 20.6 ± 4.8% and for screening examinations only was 13.9 ± 5.0%. Corresponding means for adenoma detection were 31.5 ± 6.7% and 20.7 ± 4.1%, respectively. Simple regression of overall adenoma detection rate versus overall serrated detection rate was not significant (R = 0.571, P = 0.237), but was significant for screening exams (R = 0.854, P = 0.031). There was a strong relationship between time of withdrawal and serrated detection rate (screening, R = 0.908, P = 0.012; overall, R = 0.956, P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Taking time to withdraw the colonoscope is essential for maximum detection of serrated polyps. The ability to find adenomas does not necessarily correlate with an ability to find serrated polyps.
