Results of treatment of 277 patients with colorectal cancer stage IV complicated by the urinary tract invasion, were analyzed. Men were 168 (60.7%); women - 109 (39.3%). Patients aged 31-79 years (59.6Â±5.7) years. All patients were operated on radically with the resection of the invaded parts of the urinary tract en bloc. Both abdominal surgeons and urologists took part in the operation. The study proved that the invasion of the urinary tract by colorectal cancer should not become a reason for the surgery refusal. The subtotal resection of the urinary bladder by its cancer invasion demonstrated the appropriate radicalism and functional postoperative results. The efficacy of such combined operations was proved by the high level of social adaptation of the operated patients - 18 (51.4%) of 35 followed up patients came back to the previous level of social activity. Urinary tracts' resection did not influenced the level of postoperative lethality.
