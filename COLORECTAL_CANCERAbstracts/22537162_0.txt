This phase II, open-label, single-arm study investigated sunitinib + FOLFIRI in Japanese patients with treatment-na√Øve unresectable/metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients received i.v. FOLFIRI (levo-leucovorin 200 mg/m(2) + irinotecan 180 mg/m(2), followed by 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m(2) bolus then 2400 mg/m(2) 46-h infusion) every 2 weeks, and oral sunitinib 37.5 mg/day on Schedule 4/2 (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off), until disease progression or treatment withdrawal. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint, with a target median of 10.8 months (35% improvement over FOLFIRI alone). Seventy-one patients started a median of 3 (range 1-11) sunitinib cycles (median relative dose intensity, <60%). The median PFS was 6.7 months (95% confidence interval, 4.7-9.2) by independent review, 7.2 months (95% confidence interval, 5.4-9.5) by investigator assessment. Objective response rate (complete responses + partial responses) was 36.6% (independent review) and 42.3% (investigator assessment). Clinical benefit rate (complete responses + partial responses + stable disease) was 83.1% (independent review) and 88.7% (investigator assessment). Common all-causality, any-grade, adverse events were: neutropenia and leukopenia (both 97.2%); thrombocytopenia (84.5%); diarrhea and nausea (both 78.9%); decreased appetite (74.6%); and fatigue (66.2%). Neutropenia (96%) was the most frequent grade 3/4 adverse event. This study was closed early due to findings from a concurrent phase III study of sunitinib + FOLFIRI in non-Japanese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In conclusion, the median PFS for sunitinib + FOLFIRI in Japanese patients was shorter than the 10.8 month target, indicating that sunitinib did not add to the antitumor activity of FOLFIRI.
