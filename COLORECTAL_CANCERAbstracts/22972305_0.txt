The cellular prion protein (PrPc) is a glycoprotein anchored by glycosylphosphatidylinositol             to the cell surface and is abundantly expressed in various tissues. The putative             roles of PrPc are thought to be related to cell signaling, survival, and differentiation             and cancer progression. In this study, we demonstrated that the expression of             PrPc correlates with a more aggressive and histologically unfavorable disease             in colorectal carcinomas. Moreover, we found that PrPc mediates the process of             epithelial-mesenchymal transition and, thereby, promotes CRC metastasis. Transcriptome             profiling of PrPc-depleted cells revealed downregulation of the special AT-rich             sequence-binding protein-1 (SATB1). PrPc is demonstrated to be involved in regulating             SATB1 expression via the Fyn-SP1 pathway. Since SATB1 has been previously proposed             as a key protein that controls tumor development and progression, knockdown of             PrPc resulted in a reduced metastatic capacity in CRC cells, as well as a reduction             in distant metastases in vivo. In conclusion, our data characterize a novel molecular             mechanism that links PrPc expression to the regulation of CRC metastasis. Targeting             PrPc will, therefore, be a promising strategy to overcome the metastatic advantage             in colorectal tumors.
