We investigated the frequency of BKV, JCV and SV40 reactivation in three groups of Cuban patients by multiplex nested PCR assay of 40 paraffin-embedded colorectal neoplasm tissues, 113 urine samples, and 125 plasma samples from 27 transplant recipients, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 67 HIV-1-infected individuals with central nervous system (CNS) disorders. None of these polyomaviruses were detected in colorectal neoplasms. JCV DNA was detected in 2 of 67 patients (2.9%) with CNS disorders, but neither BKV nor SV40 was identified. BKV was found in urine from 38.5% and 28.6% of adult and pediatric transplant recipients, respectively. In adult renal transplant recipients, excretion of BKV in urine was significantly associated with episodes of acute rejection (p=0.012) and with excretion of HCMV in urine (p= 0.008). In Cuba, the polyomaviruses studied here could not be related to colorectal neoplasms, and JCV was rarely detected in CSFs of HIV-1-infected individuals, whilst BKV reactivation was found to occur frequently in organ transplant recipients.
