Recently, in patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastasis, liver resection sometimes becomes possible by intensive systemic chemotherapy, i.e. conversion therapy. However, among cases that do not respond well to first-line chemotherapy, it is rare that second-line chemotherapy results in a marked response allowing liver resection. We consider that the liver resection rate may be increased by initiating second-line treatment at an earlier stage before progression subsequent to first-line chemotherapy. We are conducting a multicentre Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential chemotherapy using six cycles of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and irinotecan) followed by six cycles of bevacizumab plus FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin) as conversion chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is the liver resection rate during the bevacizumab + FOLFOX phase. Fifty patients are required for this study.
