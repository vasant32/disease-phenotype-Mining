Evidence-based information is a prerequisite for informed choice. We compared the effect of evidence-based information on colorectal cancer screening with standard information in a randomised controlled trial. The primary endpoint was informed choice. We randomised 1 577 people insured by a large German statutory health insurance scheme, the Gm√ºnder Ersatzkasse (GEK). The evidence-based information significantly increased informed choices: 44.0% vs. 12.8%; (difference 31.2%, 99% CI 25.7-36.7%; P<0.001).
