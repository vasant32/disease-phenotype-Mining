 OBJECTIVES: The CHOICE study was a prospective, multicentre, observational study designed to assess levels of adherence in current clinical practice to the European product label and EORTC guidelines for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anaemia (CIA) with darbepoetin alfa (DA). Here we present data split by tumour types: breast, colorectal, ovarian and lung. METHODS: Haemoglobin (Hb) levels and red blood cell transfusion requirements were evaluated among patients with solid tumours in 11 European countries. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with a target Hb level of ≥10-≤12 g/dL. RESULTS: The full analysis set included 1887 patients (mean ± SD 62.4 ± 11.4 years); 1585 (84%) had a current disease stage of ≥3. Common chemotherapy regimens were non-platinum + non-taxane based (n = 696 [37%]) or platinum + non-taxane based (n = 660 [35%]). Breast cancer (n = 575): The mean ± SD Hb level at baseline was 9.9 ± 0.8 g/dL (n = 568). Target Hb level was reached by 187 (55%) patients. Colorectal cancer (n = 310): At baseline the mean ± SD Hb level was 9.8 ± 0.8 g/dL (n = 306). Target Hb level was reached by 107 patients (56%). Ovarian cancer (n = 301): The mean ± SD Hb level at baseline was 9.7 ± 0.8 g/dL (n = 294). Target Hb level was reached by 81 patients (44%). Lung cancer (n = 701): At baseline the mean ± SD Hb level was 9.8 ± 0.9 g/dL (n = 692). Target Hb level was reached by 142 patients (39%). Safety: Five severe or life-threatening adverse drug reactions were seen (three patients with breast cancer, one patient with colorectal cancer and one patient with ovarian cancer). Limitations: Potential bias could not be excluded due to the study's observational nature. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the recommendations are adhered to in clinical practice, with the mean starting Hb level <10 g/dL irrespective of tumour type. Furthermore, DA is likely to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of CIA in patients with breast, colorectal, ovarian or lung cancer.
