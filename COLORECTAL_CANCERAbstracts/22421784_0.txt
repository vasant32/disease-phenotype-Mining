A 55-year-old male had complained of melena.Colonoscopy revealed a type 2 tumor at the rectum.CT demonstrated hepatic lymph nodes and multiple liver metastases(stage IV).Low anterior resection was performed(tub2, RsRa, circ, type 2, pSS, pN1, sH3, cHN1, sP0, cM0: fstage IV).The patient was treated with mFOLFOX6 and sLV5FU2 after operation.CT revealed a partial response after 14 courses of systemic chemotherapy.sLV5 FU2 therapy was converted to capecitabine because he experienced bone marrow suppression.CT showed that the liver metastases had enlarged but the hepatic lymph nodes disappeared.Right portal vein embolization was performed.After 4 weeks, right hepatectomy and hepatic lymph node dissection were performed.Preoperative chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 seems beneficial as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy for hepatic lymph node-positive advanced colorectal cancer.
