This position paper of the Section of Gastrointestinal Oncology of the Israeli Gastroenterological Association recommends specific guidelines for colorectal cancer surveillance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a severe complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), generally developing into a longstanding disease. The Lifetime prevalence of CRC in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients is estimated to be 2% after 10 years, 8% after 20 years, and even 18% after 30 years of extensive disease. Screening colonoscopy should be initiated 8-10 years after onset of symptoms in extensive UC patients (pancolitis), and after 15 years in patients with left-sided colitis (UC or Crohn's). Surveillance should continue periodically at an interval of every 1 to 2 years. Surveillance colonoscopies should be performed in combination with an extensive biopsy protocol. High-grade dysplasia (HGD) in flat mucosa or a dysplasia associated Lesion or mass (DALM) is considered an indication for colectomy when the pathological findings are confirmed by a second experienced pathologist. Further research is directed toward improving detection of dysplasia during colonoscopy through the use of novel endoscopic imaging techniques which are hoped to impact the approach to cancer prevention in patients with IBD.
