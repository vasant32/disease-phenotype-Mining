Cancer is the leading cause of mortality in Singapore. The age-standardized incidence rates continue to increase as the population grows and ages, and the influence of environmental and lifestyle choices bear their consequences. The increase is most marked in colorectal, breast and prostate cancers, mirroring the most common cancers seen in other developed countries. The eradication of infectious disease such as hepatitis B, through the implementation of the hepatitis B immunization programme in 1985, has led to the decline in liver cancer. The Singapore Cancer Registry collates detailed information on newly diagnosed and existing cancer cases, enabling the study and understanding of cancer trends in the population and across the different ethnic groups. A coordinated approach to address cancer prevention and treatment through public education and increased awareness, screening and early detection, and the institution of appropriate multidisciplinary care, on a background of continued basic and clinical research is required to deliver quality cancer care.
