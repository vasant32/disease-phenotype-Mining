A 70-year-old man with operated colorectal cancer relapsed with a solitary lung metastasis. Dual time-point PET/CT performed at 60' (standard images) and after 2 hours (delayed images) showed focal uptake in the lung nodule. A second uptake in the liver dome was also visualized only in the delayed images. Radiofrequency of the lung metastasis was performed by CT-fluoroscopy guide. A PET/CT 1 month after radiofrequency showed significant reduction of activity in the delayed images, and the uptake at 3 months was virtually normal. A fine-needle biopsy of the liver lesion confirmed the final diagnosis of metastasis from adenocarcinoma.
