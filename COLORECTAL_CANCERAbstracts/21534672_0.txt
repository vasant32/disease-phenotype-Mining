 OBJECTIVE: We explored whether relationships among health perceptions differ depending on individuals' stage of readiness for colorectal cancer screening (CRCS). METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) were used to stage adults over 50 years of age (N = 2324) using a modified version of the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) staging algorithm. Health perceptions examined included perceived risk of cancer, worry about cancer, fatalism, and beliefs about ambiguity of cancer prevention recommendations. RESULTS: Meaningful differences in patterns of relationships among health perceptions by stage were found. CONCLUSIONS: The nonlinear patterns that emerged indicate support for the role of these health perceptions in screening, the idea that behavioral readiness may moderate the relationship between important health perceptions, and the use of the stage construct in this context.
