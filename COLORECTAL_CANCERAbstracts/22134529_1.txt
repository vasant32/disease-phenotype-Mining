MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in regulating diverse cellular pathways.             Although there is emerging evidence that various miRNAs function as oncogenes             or tumor suppressors in colorectal cancer (CRC), the role of miRNAs in mediating             liver metastasis remains unexplored. The expression profile of miRNAs in liver             metastasis and primary CRC tissues was analyzed by miRNA microarrays and verified             by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In 62 CRC patients, the expression             levels of miR-320a were determined by real-time PCR, and the effects on migration             and invasion of miR-320a were determined using a transwell assay. miR-320a target             genes were confirmed by luciferase assay, real-time PCR and western blot analysis.             A set of miRNAs was found to be dysregulated in the liver metastasis tissues compared             to matched primary CRC tissues, and the expression levels of miR-320a were significantly             decreased in the liver metastasis tissues examined. miR-320a was correlated with             tumor progression in CRC. miR-320a was downregulated in liver metastatic colon             cancer cells and inhibited liver metastatic colon cancer cell migration and invasion.             miR-320a directly binds to the 3'UTR of neuropilin 1 (NRP-1), a protein that functions             as a co-receptor of vascular epithelial growth factor. miR-320a downregulated             the expression of NRP-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. These data demonstrated             that miR-320a may be useful for identifying CRC patients that are at an elevated             risk for developing liver metastasis. Our findings suggest that miR-320a may be             a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
