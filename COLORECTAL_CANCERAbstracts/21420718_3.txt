TNM stage I colorectal cancer is commonly characterized by a good prognosis, with 5-year survival of around 80% to 90%. Nonetheless, disease progression occurs in a percentage of cases, although the causes of an adverse clinical course still remain to be clarified. In the present study, we analyzed and compared the immunohistochemical expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, an iron-binding protein, which is involved in colorectal cancer progression, in series a of 29 surgically resected colorectal carcinomas obtained from patients who died of the disease and in a cohort of 22 colorectal cancers from patients alive 5 years after the initial diagnosis. The prognostic value of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin expression on the overall survival to colorectal cancer was investigated. Variable neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin immunoexpression was demonstrated in 23 of the 51 analyzed cases, with a significantly higher frequency of positive cases among patients who died of the disease. Moreover, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin expression appeared to be a significant independent negative prognostic marker related to shorter overall survival in stage I colorectal carcinoma. If our findings are confirmed in further analyses, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin assessment might be used to select patients with a higher risk of progression and to find adjuvant therapies for the prevention of adverse outcomes.
