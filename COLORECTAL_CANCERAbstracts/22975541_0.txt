We herein present a case of IIc-like metastatic lung cancer that was detected early. A 65-year-old man presented with diarrhea and difficulty walking. Colonoscopy demonstrated a depressed lesion in the descending colon. However, the appearance of the lesion by endoscopy with a magnifying objective was not compatible with early colon cancer. Therefore, we performed diagnostic endoscopic mucosal resection to allow for an examination of the whole lesion. A histological examination demonstrated lung cancer metastasis to the colon. Only 1.6% of lung cancers metastasize to the large intestine, and metastatic colorectal cancer is not usually detected at an early stage. In the present case, however, endoscopy and a histological examination revealed alterations in the mucosal configuration of the lesion, which were unusual for early colon cancer.
