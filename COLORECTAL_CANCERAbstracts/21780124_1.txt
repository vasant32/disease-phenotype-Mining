 BACKGROUND: The combined treatment of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and perioperative chemotherapy (PIC) for colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) is a rigorous surgical treatment most suited for fit and young patients. With technical maturity and improved perioperative care, we examined the outcomes of elderly patients undergoing CRS and PIC for colorectal PC. METHODS: All consecutive patients treated in two tertiary centers for PC of colorectal cancer who were 70 years of age or older at the time of surgery were included. Data on patient characteristics, concomitant diseases, operation details, perioperative course, and follow-up were retrieved from medical charts. Primary outcomes were perioperative morbidity and mortality. Secondary outcomes were disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (11 male) were included in this study (mean age 73.5 years). In eight patients major complications occurred. In six patients the postoperative course was complicated by minor adverse events. There was no perioperative mortality. Median overall survival was 35 months with a 6, 12, and 18 months survival rate of 94%, 83%, and 68%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CRS and PIC for colorectal PC may be safely performed with acceptable morbidity in selected elderly patients. When considering patients for surgery, performance status, and the disease extent should be used as eligibility criteria rather than age.
