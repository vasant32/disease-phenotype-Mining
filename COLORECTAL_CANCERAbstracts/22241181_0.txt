To ascertain the approach and degree of consensus of pathologists in the handling and regression grading of colorectal cancer resection specimens treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation, a ten-part questionnaire was circulated to 18 gastrointestinal pathologists in eight countries. The questions were specific and addressed pertinent issues related to colorectal cancer with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. There is a lack of consensus on how to handle the specimen, number of sections taken, correlation with pre- and post-operative radiological imaging, and especially, regression grading schema employed. Consensus in the form of guidelines is required so that the pathological assessment of these specimens will provide clinically relevant information for patient management, irrespective of location.
