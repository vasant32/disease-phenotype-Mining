Hepatic sinusoidal injury arises occasionally after oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. As a result, portal hypertension associated with splenomegaly occurs in some cases. We report two cases of advanced colorectal cancer which showed splenomegaly after administration of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. In both cases, mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab was administered as a firstline chemotherapy. Splenic volume was determined by loading the CT images onto a commercially available workstation. In case 1, initial splenic volume was 137.82mL. Two months later, it increased to 160.96mL. After six cycles of chemotherapy, we removed oxaliplatin due to peripheral neuropathy. Consequently, the splenic volume decreased to 151.58mL. Subsequent to the reintroduction of oxaliplatin, the splenic volume increased to 177.48mL. Following two cycles of mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab, oxaliplatin was removed again. In a similar way, splenic volume decreased to 158.52mL. In case 2, initial splenic volume was 105.84mL. Ten months later, it increased to 228.54mL. After administration of mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab, we continued chemotherapy with sLV5FU2/bevacizumab and irinotecan. The splenic volume decreased to 197. 06mL. In conclusion, oxaliplatin- based chemotherapy induces an increase in splenic volume, however, it may be reversible after discontinuation of oxaliplatin.
