Association of aggressive jejunal carcinoid tumors and other primary gastrointestinal neoplasms are rarely observed. We describe the case of a synchronous jejunal carcinoid tumor and two colorectal polyps in a 78-year old woman. Surgical intervention was performed for the colorectal tumors and the carcinoid was incidentally found. It was well differentiated but was accompanied by lymph node metastasis and peritoneal carcinomatosis. In this case, the prognosis was not depending by the colorectal tumors but the aggressive feature of jejunal carcinoid lead to patient's death.
