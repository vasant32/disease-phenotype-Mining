 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of major urological procedures performed in patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data of 37 patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer who underwent major urological surgical procedures along with simultaneous cancer surgery between the years of 2005 and 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age was 58.3 years. Male/Female ratio was 2.7. 59% of the patients were primary, and 41% were recurrent cases of colorectal cancer. Bladder, ureters, urethra, kidneys and prostate were found as invaded in 19, 9, 5, 2 and 2 cases, respectively. The following single or combined procedures were performed; partial (n=11) or total (n=8; 2 combined with urethrocutaneostomy, 6 with ileal-conduit) cystectomy, urethroplasty (n=5), nephroureterectomy (n=2), radical nephrectomy (n=1), partial nephrectomy (n=1), ureteroneocystostomy (n=7), Boari's flap (n=4), transureteroureterostomy (n=3). Prolonged drainage was the most common surgical complication (27%). Urethrocutaneous fistula and total urinary incontinence were encountered in 1 and 1 patient, respectively. The incidence of hydronephrosis and elevated creatinine were 38% (preoperative 27%; postoperative 11%) and 24% (11% preoperative; 13% postoperative), respectively. Two deaths occurred in the first month of operations. Mean duration of follow up was 18(6-28) months for surviving 13 patients. Overall survival in 24 cases resulting in death was 21(1-42) months. CONCLUSIONS: Since the most important eventual effects of locally advanced colorectal cancer are on the kidneys from the urological point of view; the aim of an urologist, as a member of surgical team, should be preserving renal function in addition to helping complete removal of the tumor.
