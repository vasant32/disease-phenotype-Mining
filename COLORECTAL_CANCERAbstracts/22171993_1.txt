Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEM) promote tumor angiogenesis and growth in experimental cancer models. The role of TEM in cancer patients is unknown. We studied TEM in healthy volunteers and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Although TEM were detectable in the blood and tumor lesions of CRC patients, their frequency and functional phenotype showed no correlation with levels of angiopoietin-2 or vascular endothelial growth factor, microvessel density, tumor markers, tumor stage, or outcome of antiangiogenic therapy. These unexpected findings are at odds with murine tumor models and question the diagnostic or therapeutic value of TEM in human cancer.
