 BACKGROUND: Investigations concerned the mechanism of HT-29 cells radiosensitization by cis-9,trans-11-conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11-CLA), a natural component of human diet with proven antitumor activity. METHODS: The cells were incubated for 24h with 70μM c9,t11-CLA and then X-irradiated. The following methods were used: gas chromatography (incorporation of the CLA isomer), flow cytometry (cell cycle), cloning (survival), Western blotting (protein distribution in membrane fractions), and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (rejoining of DNA double-strand breaks). In parallel, DNA-PK activity, γ-H2AX foci numbers and chromatid fragmentation were estimated. Gene expression was analysed by RT-PCR and chromosomal aberrations by the mFISH method. Nuclear accumulation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) was monitored by ELISA. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: C9,t11-CLA sensitized HT-29 cells to X-radiation. This effect was not due to changes in cell cycle progression or DNA-repair-related gene expression. Post-irradiation DSB rejoining was delayed, corresponding with the insufficient DNA-PK activation, although chromosomal aberration frequencies did not increase. Distributions of cholesterol and caveolin-1 in cellular membrane fractions changed. The nuclear EGFR translocation, necessary to increase the DNA-PK activity in response to oxidative stress, was blocked. We suppose that c9,t11-CLA modified the membrane structure, thus disturbing the intracellular EGFR transport and the EGFR-dependent pro-survival signalling, both functionally associated with lipid raft properties. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results point to the importance of the cell membrane interactions with the nucleus after injury inflicted by X -rays. Compounds like c9,t11-CLA, that specifically alter membrane properties, could be used to develop new anticancer strategies.
