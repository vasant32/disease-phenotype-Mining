Cancer cells are characterized by an uncontrolled increase in cell proliferation.             G1 to S transition is one of the two main checkpoints used by cells to control             the cell cycle progress and cell proliferation. G1/S progression is highly regulated             by multiple intracellular signaling transduction cascades including Akt and p53             pathways, which therefore becomes a promising target for the development of novel             anticancer therapy. Scutellaria barbata D. Don (SB) is a major component in many             Chinese medicine formulas that have long been used in China to clinically treat             various cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently, we reported that             the ethanol extract of SB (EESB) is able to induce cancer cell apoptosis via activation             of the mitochondrion-dependent pathway and inhibit tumor angiogenesis through             suppression of Hedgehog signaling. To further elucidate the precise mechanisms             of its antitumor activity, in the present study we evaluated the effect of EESB             on the proliferation of human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells and investigated the             underlying molecular mechanism. We found that EESB could inhibit the proliferation             of HT-29 cells through blocking the G1/S cell cycle progression. In addition,             EESB treatment profoundly promoted antiproliferative p21 expression, but inhibited             the expression of pro-proliferative PCNA, cyclin D1 and CDK4 in HT-29 cells. Moreover,             the phosphorylation/activation of Akt was significantly suppressed by EESB treatment,             whereas that of p53 was enhanced. These results suggest that EESB could effectively             induce G1/S arrest in human colon carcinoma cells via modulation of multiple cell             cycle-related signaling pathways.
