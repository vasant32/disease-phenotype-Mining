 BACKGROUND: Candidate of metastasis-1 (COM-1) is a molecule which is stress-induced and cell growth-related. The current study investigated the impact of COM-1 and role of Peroxisome Proliferating Activator Receptor-gamma (PPARγ) agonists on COM-1 knock down in colorectal cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of COM-1 was knocked out in the colorectal cancer cell lines RKO and CaCO2 by transfection with ribozyme transgenes which specifically targeted COM-1. Cell growth, cell migration and apoptosis were measured in wild-type, control and COM-1 knock down cells. The impact or treatment with the PPARγ agonists on the function of COM-1 knock down cells was monitored. RESULTS: COM-1 knock-down cells grew slower than wild-type and control cells. When treated with the PPARγ agonist ciglitazone and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) at several different concentrations, all types of cells grew slower to some extent. Cells with COM-1 knock-down had the same mobility as wild-type and control cells. More apoptotic and dead cells were detected when cells were treated with ciglitazone at 3 μM, especially of COM-1 knock down cells. CONCLUSION: COM-1 is an anti-apoptotic gene and a cell growth promoter. Furthermore, the PPARγ agonist could increase the inhibitory effect seen in COM-1 knock-down cell growth and to promote apoptosis. In regards to metastasis, COM-1 appears to play no role in cell motility.
