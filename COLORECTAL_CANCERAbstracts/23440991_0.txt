Chromosomal instability is a potentially critical step in the development of colorectal cancer. The budding uninhibited by benzimidazole 1 (BUB1) gene is a highly conserved protein that plays a critical role at the spindle assembly checkpoint during cell division. BUB1 mutations function in a dominant-negative fashion and have been implicated in causing dysfunctional kinetochore attachments, premature chromatid separation, accelerated mis-segregation of whole chromosomes and aneuploidy. BUB1 mutations have been observed in patients with colorectal cancers. We report a remarkable case of BUB1 haploinsufficiency owing to a 1.7 Mb deletion of chromosome 2q13 in a 54-year-old man with no prior history of carcinoma. These mutant alleles were observed in both tissue from the hand and peripheral blood. Aneuploidy was not observed on cytogenetic analysis. These findings highlight the insufficiency of BUB1 haploinsufficiency to directly stimulate tumourigenesis, and suggest that other factors may be more critical to this process.
