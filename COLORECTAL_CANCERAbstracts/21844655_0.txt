Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play a vital role in the phase II biotransformation of many chemicals, including anticancer drugs. In this study, to elucidate the haplotype structures of the two closely related alpha-class genes GSTA1 and GSTA2, we screened for genetic variation in 214 Japanese colorectal cancer patients who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. By direct resequencing of the 5'-flanking region, all the exons, and their flanking introns for 107 patients, 29 and 27 variants were identified in GSTA1 and GSTA2, respectively. The known functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -567T>G, -69C>T, and -52G>A in GSTA1*B were found at allele frequencies of 0.140. Of the four major GSTA2 allelic variants reported previously (GSTA2*A, *B, *C, and *E), only GSTA2*B (frequency = 0.154), *C (0.706), and *E (0.140) were detected. Following linkage disequilibrium analysis, haplotypes of both genes were separately estimated. Then, rapid genotyping methods for 7 and 6 SNPs tagging common haplotypes of GSTA1 and GSTA2, respectively, were developed using the single-base extension assay, and an additional 107 patients were genotyped. Finally, haplotype combinations of both genes were classified into 3 major types: GSTA1*A-GSTA2*C, GSTA1*A-GSTA2*B, and GSTA1*B-GSTA2*E. These findings will be useful in pharmacogenomic studies on xenobiotics including anticancer drugs.
