 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Mini laparotomy is technical for the resection of colorectal cancer (CRC) in selected patients. The aim was to compare clinical outcomes of mini laparotomy with conventional laparotomy in CRC patients. METHODOLOGY: Between january 2007 and june 2010, 138 patients and 117 patients underwent elective resection using either mini laparotomy or conventional laparotomy respectively. Mini laparotomy involved a colorectal resection performed through a skin incision â‰¤8 cm in length. Clinicopathological factors, operative procedure and postoperative course were retrospectively analyzed to compare clinical outcomes between the two groups. RESULTS: Mini laparotomy seems to be an attractive alternative for resection of CRC in selected patients. Clinicopathological and histopathological features were similar between both groups, whereas intraoperative blood loss, operative time and harvested lymph-node numbers in conventional laparotomy were significantly greater (p=0.003, p=0.008 and p=0.024, respectively). Postoperative relapse, complications and hospitalization were significantly better in the mini laparotomy (all p<0.001). In comparison of postoperative complications between convention and mini laparotomy, ileus was more frequently encountered in conventional group (p=0.001). Interestingly, the disease-free survival and overall survival in mini laparotomy group were significantly better than control group (p=0.001 and p=0.017, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to conventional laparotomy, mini laparotomy seems a feasible, minimally invasive and attractive alternative in selected patients.
