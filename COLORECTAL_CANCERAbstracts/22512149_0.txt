Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is a rare disease characterized by the presence of gas into the colonic wall. Symptoms are non specific and, most of the time, the diagnosis is done by an abdominal CT scan. We report a case of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis which occurred in a patient with a colorectal cancer in palliative stage. This patient was treated by 5 fluorouracil (5FU), folinic acid and oxaliplatin chemotherapy, after a first lign of chemotherapy with 5FU, irinotecan and cetuximab. The association of chemotherapy is most likely probable.
