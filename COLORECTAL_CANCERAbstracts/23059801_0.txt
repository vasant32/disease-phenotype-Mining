Immunochemical stool blood tests have a significantly higher sensitivity for the detection of advanced neoplasia and colorectal cancer. Based on national and international studies it has been required to include them into the national cancer screening programme in Germany also. The sensitivity (detection limit) can be set by the manufacturer in order to achieve an optimal and balanced result between sensitivity and specificity. The present study was conducted with 639 patients who have undergone both the screening colonoscopy, as well as the immunochemical stool blood test. The test "immoCARE-C" provided by the company CARE diagnostica Laborreagenzien GmbH was used in the study. The test has been evaluated with seven levels of detection limits between 500  ng/mL and 25  ng/mL. The best sensitivity for detection of advanced lesions was demonstrated by a cut-off of 50 ng/mL and 25  ng/mL. The specificity did not fall below 90  %. These positive results lead to considerations to organise a primary access to such tests in the prevention of colorectal cancer as a kind of filter before offering the screening colonoscopy.
