The association between body composition parameters and toxicity from hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy regimens has not been analyzed. We assessed data from patients with advanced cancer and liver metastases treated on a clinical trial of a regimen of HAI oxaliplatin combined with systemic 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and bevacizumab. Correlations between patient characteristics, response, and toxicity and body composition data taken from CT images were analyzed. Forty-eight of 57 patients (mean age 56 yr; 60% women) had available CT scans. The most common diagnosis was colorectal cancer (22/48, 46%); 30/48 patients (63%) had body mass index (BMI) â‰¥25 kg/m(2). Twenty (42%) of 48 patients were sarcopenic. Grade 3-4 adverse events did not differ among patients with and without sarcopenia or according to BMI. The median survival (95% C]) was 167 (128-206) days for sarcopenic and 280 (214-346) days for nonsarcopenic patients (P = 0.271). Among patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose, the median survival was 103 days for sarcopenic and 312 days for nonsarcopenic patients (P = 0.173). Sarcopenia was present in 30% (6/20) of patients with reduction in tumor size posttreatment, and in 52% (14/27) of patients with increased tumor size (P = 0.171). In conclusion, body composition was not significantly associated with toxicities or survival in our small sample.
