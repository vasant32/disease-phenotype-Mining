BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastrointestinal polyposis is a common clinical problem, yet there is no consensus on how to best manage patients with moderate-load polyposis. Identifying genetic features of this disorder could improve management, and especially surveillance, of these patients. We sought to determine the prevalence of hamartomatous polyposis associated mutations in the susceptibility genes PTEN,BMPR1A, SMAD4, ENG, andSTK11 in individuals with 5 or more gastrointestinal polyps, including at least 1 hamartomatous or hyperplastic/serrated polyp. METHODS: We performed a prospective, referral-based study of 603 patients (median age 51 y; range, 2-89 y), enrolled from June 2006 through January 2012. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes and analyzed for specific mutations and large rearrangements in PTEN,BMPR1A,SMAD4, and STK11, as well as mutations in ENG. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to determine cutoffs for continuous variables. The prevalence of mutations was compared using Fischer's exact test. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine univariate and multivariate risk factors. RESULTS: Of 603 patients, 119 (20%) had a personal history of colorectal cancer and most (461; 76%) had fewer than 30 polyps. Seventy-seven patients (13%) were found to have polyposis-associated mutations, comprising 11 inENG (1.8%), 13 inPTEN (2.2%), 13 inSTK11 (2.2%), 20 inBMPR1A (3.3%), and 21 inSMAD4 (3.5%). Univariate clinical predictors for risk of having these mutations included age at presentation less than 40 years (19% vs 10%;P =.008), a polyp burden of 30 or more (19% vs 11%;P =0.014), and male sex (16% vs 10%;P =.03). Patients who had 1 or more ganglioneuromas (29% vs 2%;P <.001) or presented with polyps of 3 or more histologic types (20% vs 2%;P =.003) were more likely to have germline mutations inPTEN. CONCLUSIONS: Age less than 40 years, male sex, and specific polyp histologies are significantly associated with risk of germline mutations in hamartomatous-polyposis associated genes. These associations could guide clinical decision making and further investigations.
