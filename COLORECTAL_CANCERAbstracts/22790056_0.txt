A 76-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with diarrhea and weight loss in February 2007. A CT scan revealed a tumor in the abdominal cavity, and although a thorough investigation was conducted, no diagnosis was made. Therefore, she underwent diagnostic surgery in April 2007. Intraoperatively, the tumor was determined to have originated in the transverse colon, with invasion to other organs. The patient underwent a transverse colectomy, partial ileal resection, and partial resection of the bladder and peritoneum were performed. The pathological diagnosis was colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma. FOLFOX4 chemotherapy was initiated in May 2007. However, a CT scan in June 2007 revealed a recurrent tumor in the right pelvis. Although right hemicolectomy and right oophorectomy were performed in August, a CT scan in September 2007 revealed a recurrent tumor in the right pelvis. Following treatment with bevacizumab+levofolinate+5-FU, the tumor disappeared. The patient continued to receive this chemotherapy regimen until August 2010, and CT scans showed a complete response. Even though colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma is known to have a poor prognosis, the present case was effectively treated with bevacizumab+levofolinate+5-FU chemotherapy. Herein we provide discussion and suggestions about treatment for colorectal neuroendocrine carcinoma.
