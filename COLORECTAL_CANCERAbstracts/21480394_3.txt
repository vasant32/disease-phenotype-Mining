OCT4, a POU-domain transcription factor is considered to be a key factor in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells. Several OCT4 isoforms are differentially expressed in human pluripotent and non-pluripotent cells. Reactivation of OCT4 expression is postulated to occur in differentiated cells that have undergone tumorigenesis. To examine OCT4 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues, and to assess the efficacy of OCT4 as a potential biomarker for CRC, in this study, we investigated its expression in CRC tissues, evaluated its relationship to various clinicopathological parameters and defined the isoform of OCT4 that was found to be expressed in CRC cases. Primary tumor tissues and matching adjacent non-cancerous tissues were obtained from 84 CRC patients. OCT4 expression and isoform determination were documented by reverse transcription-PCR and real-time PCR. OCT4, Sox-2, and NANOG localization were performed using immunohistochemistry. The isoforms expressed in the studied cases were confirmed by sequencing. Twenty biopsy specimens representing healthy tissues, retrieved from colonoscopy were studied in parallel as controls. OCT4 expression levels were higher in CRC tissues compared to matching, adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and healthy controls. Additionally, the levels of OCT4 expression in CRC tissues correlated with tumor stage. OCT4 and Sox-2 were localized in the nuclei and the cytoplasm of CRC cells. In all CRC cases, we found that the OCT4B1 isoform is expressed. Over-expression of OCT4B1 was found in poorly and moderately differentiated CRC tissues. In conclusion, the data imply that OCT4B1 isoform may represent a potential biomarker for the initiation, progression, and differentiation of CRC.
