Loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (cachexia) is severe in patients with colorectal liver metastases because of the large increase in resting energy expenditure but remains understudied due to a lack of suitable preclinical models. Our aim was to characterize a novel preclinical model of cachexia in colorectal liver metastases. We tested the hypothesis that mice with colorectal liver metastases would exhibit cachexia, as evidenced by a reduction in liver-free body mass, muscle mass and physiological impairment. Twelve week old male CBA mice received an intrasplenic injection of Ringer's solution (sham) or murine colorectal cancer cells (MoCR) to induce colorectal liver metastases. At end-point (20-29 days), the livers of MoCR mice were infiltrated completely with metastases and MoCR mice had reduced liver-free body mass, muscle mass and epididymal fat mass compared with sham controls (P<0.03). MoCR mice exhibited impaired rotarod performance and grip strength (P<0.03). Histochemical analyses of tibialis anterior muscles from MoCR mice revealed muscle fiber atrophy and reduced oxidative enzyme activity (P<0.001). Adipose tissue remodeling was evident in MoCR mice, with reduced adipocyte diameter and greater infiltration of non-adipocyte tissue (P<0.05). These findings reveal the MoCR mouse model exhibits significant cachexia and is a suitable preclinical model of cachexia in colorectal liver metastases. This model should be utilized for identifying effective treatments for cachexia to improve quality of life and reduce mortality in patients with colorectal liver metastases.
