 BACKGROUND: Recently, Stein et al. identified the metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) gene by genome-wide search for differentially expressed genes in human colon cancer tissues and metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed MACC1 expression levels in 52 colorectal cancer samples using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). RESULTS: We found that MACC1 expression showed significant correlation with peritoneal dissemination (p=0.042) and higher stage of TNM classification (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MACC1 is more frequently expressed in advanced colorectal carcinomas.
