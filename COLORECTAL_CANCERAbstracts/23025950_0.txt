The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for postoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) and urinary retention (UR) in patients with colorectal cancer. Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2006-2009, a retrospective analysis of surgical patients with colorectal cancer was  conducted. Patients were stratified into groups, with or without UTI/UR. The LASSO algorithm for logistic regression identified independent risk factors. A total of 93,931 surgical patients with colorectal cancer were identified. The incidences of UTI and UR were 5.91 and 2.52 per cent, respectively.  Overall in-hospital mortality was 2.68 per cent. The UTI group demonstrated significantly higher in-hospital mortality rates compared with those without. Both UTI and UR groups were associated with prolonged hospital stay and increased hospital charge. Multivariate logistic regression analysis  revealed age older than 60 years, females, anemia, congestive heart failure, coagulopathy, diabetes with chronic complications, fluid and electrolyte, paralysis, pulmonary circulation disorders, renal failure, and weight loss were independent risk factors of UTI. Age older than 60 years, male  gender, rectal and rectosigmoid cancers, and postoperative anastomotic leakage and ileus were independent risk factors for UR. Postoperative UTI increases in-house mortality. Postoperative UTI/UR in patients with colorectal cancer increases length of stay and hospital charges. Knowledge of  these specific risk factors for UTI and UR is needed to counsel patients and prevent these complications in this high-risk population.
