 OBJECTIVES: Classical and proliferative tumour markers and matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors reflect the features of malignancy and are useful in prediction of prognosis in patients with colorectal liver metastases. There is very limited information about their physiological functions during regeneration and healing of liver parenchyma after any type of liver surgery for malignancy. METHODS: The presented study included the patients, who underwent following surgical procedures for CLM, benign liver lesions and inguinal hernias: Group A: 22 patients with inguinal hernias, Group B: 26 patients with benign liver lesions, Group C: 30 patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM) who were treated by radiofrequency ablation, Group D: 41 patients with CLM who underwent a radical surgical therapy - resection, and Group E: 22 patients with inoperable CLM who underwent an explorative laparotomy without any surgical procedure. RESULTS: The preoperative and postoperative serum levels of CEA, CA 19-9, TK, TPA, TPS, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were statistically analyzed and compared within the groups to estimate the influence of a surgical procedure type. These results reflect the influence of surgical procedure on the serum levels of studied tumour markers during operation. CONCLUSIONS: It was the first description using these types of comparison to all metalloproteinases, their inhibitors, and proliferative and classical tumour markers. It could help us to estimate the critical relations of these tumour markers in prognoses of disease free survival or overall survival in patients after a surgical procedure for CLM (Tab. 5, Ref. 26).
