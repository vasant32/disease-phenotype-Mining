Aim:  The inappropriate use of the 'two week wait' pathway for suspected colorectal cancer (CRC2ww) may overload urgent clinics and delay the assessment and investigation of other patients. Those who have been previously referred and investigated for suspected colorectal cancer may present one group that does not warrant repeat urgent referral. This paper aims to identify the incidence and diagnostic yield of repeat CRC2ww referrals. Method:  All CRC2ww patients referred to our unit over a 4-year period were identified retrospectively. Referral indication, outcome and instances of repeat referral were identified from MDT, endoscopy and imaging databases. Results:  2735 CRC2ww referrals were made over the study period. Of these, 122 were repeated CRC2ww referrals, with the incidence increasing from 2% in 2008 to 6% in 2010 (p=0.0006). The median time to repeat referral was 1070 days. 267 cancers were detected after initial referral, including 212 colorectal cancers. The diagnostic yield was lower but not significantly so after repeated referral (6 cancers) compared with initial referral (5% vs 10%, p=0.07). Conclusion:  The incidence of repeat referral is low but the diagnostic yield is not insignificant. Exclusion of these patients from urgent assessment and investigation will not significantly reduce workload and may risk missing some patients with cancer. © 2012 The Authors Colorectal Disease © 2012 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.
