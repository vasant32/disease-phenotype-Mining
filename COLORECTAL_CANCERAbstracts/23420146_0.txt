When confronted with a suspicious rise in CA 15.3 in asymptomatic breast cancer patients following primary treatment and negative or equivocal conventional imaging findings, FDG PET/CT allows assessment of the site and extent of the recurring disease with an accuracy of 83%. Both FDG PET and FDG PET/CT are superior when compared to CT alone for the purpose of recurrence detection in patients suffering from ovarian carcinoma who have completed primary therapy but demonstrate a rising serum CA-125 level. As the global accuracy of CT alone for detection of recurrence of ovarian cancer approximates 80%, CT scan should be performed upfront to identify the site of recurrence. When confronted with negative or equivocal CT findings, FDG PET alone or FDG PET/CT should be added. In patients with rising serum CEA levels that have undergone primary treatment for a colorectal carcinoma, both FDG PET and FDG PET/CT allow detection of tumor recurrence with an accuracy of 95%, well above that of CT and MRI. Available studies further suggest that FDG/PET findings will affect treatment management in 28-50% of these patients. The detection rate of both 11C-choline and 18F-choline PET and PET/CT for local, regional, and distant recurrence in prostate carcinoma patients with a biochemical recurrence increases with rising PSA value at the time of imaging and reaches about 75% in patients with PSA > 3 ng/mL. Furthermore, PET and PET/CT with [11C]- and [18F]-choline derivates may be helpful in the clinical setting for optimization of individualized treatment.
