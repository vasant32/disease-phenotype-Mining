One hundred and ten consecutive patients suffering from a colorectal cancer received chronotherapy infused over two days every two weeks. Each course comported 5 FU 3g/m(2), folinic acid (600mg/m(2) - l. form or 1200mg/m(2) - racemic form) and oxaliplatin (85/mg/m(2) - adjuvant indication or 100mg/m(2) - palliative indication). According to chronobiological concepts, 5 FU and folinic acid were infused from 10 pm to 10 am with a peak at 4 am while oxaliplatin was delivered from 10 am to 10 pm with a peak at 4 pm. The overall tolerance was excellent with a maximum of 17% patients experiencing a grade 3 toxicity. The toxicity was higher in women, in older patients (>=70) or in case of flat infusion. In adjuvant situation (60 cases), progression free and overall survivals established respectively at 76% (42+months) and 88% (45+months). Fifty-two percent response rate were recorded within the palliative group (50 cases) with an overall 68% disease control. Median progression free survival was seven months but median survival was not attained at 31+ months. Thirty percent patients could benefit from a curative surgery after chemotherapy. Older patients (>=70) experienced worsened survival. In conclusion, we think that our chrono-FOLFOX 2-12 should be proposed as standard treatment for colorectal cancer patients.
