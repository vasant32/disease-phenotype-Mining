 BACKGROUND: The common p53 codon 72 polymorphism has been investigated as a risk factor for cancer in different populations; however, the results have been inconsistent. This study investigated the risk of developing gastric or colorectal cancer associated with the p53 codon 72 polymorphism in a Korean population. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale case-control study that included 2,213 gastric cancer patients; 1,829 colorectal cancer patients; and 1,700 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using a TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping assay. RESULTS: The frequencies of Arg/Arg, Arg/Pro, and Pro/Pro genotypes of the p53 codon 72 polymorphism were 43.3, 42.0, and 13.0% in the gastric cancer patients; 40.5, 45.0, and 14.0% in the colorectal cancer patients; and 43.2, 45.6, and 11.2% in the controls, respectively. The Pro/Pro genotype was associated with an increased risk of gastric [age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.56, P = 0.04] and colorectal cancer (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.72, P = 0.01). There were no significant interactions between the p53 codon 72 polymorphism and smoking or drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the Pro/Pro genotype is associated with modest increases in the risks of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer in a Korean population.
