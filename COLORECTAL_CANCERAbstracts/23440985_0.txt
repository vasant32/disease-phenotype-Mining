Metastasis of colorectal carcinoma to testis is rare. The authors report a case of 35-year-old man with right testicular mass. Contrast-enhanced CT scan (CECT) of testes showed testicular mass with ascitis and enlargement of retroperitoneal lymphnodes. Thus, a provisional diagnosis of disseminated primary testicular tumour was made. On subsequent high orchidectomy pathological examination revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma with CDX2 positivity thereby suggesting the possibility of metastasis from adenocarcinoma. Further, the diagnostic evaluation revealed a colorectal mass, which was inoperable (stage IV) and found to be primary colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma. The authors conclude that occult colorectal carcinoma may rarely metastasise to testis and this unusual presentation may produce diagnostic dilemma. Although rare, metastases to testes should be considered as a differential diagnosis, especially where symptoms are unusual for primary malignancy.
