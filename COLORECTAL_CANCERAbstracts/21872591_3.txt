It has become increasingly clear that microRNAs play an important role in many human diseases including cancer. Here, we show that expression of miR-21 in HEK293 and several colorectal cancer cells was found inversely correlated with ras homolog gene family, member B (RhoB) expression. miR-21 expression significantly suppressed RhoB 3' UTR luciferase-reporter activity, but the inhibitory effect was lost when the putative target sites were mutated. Exogenous miR-21 over-expression mimicked the effect of RhoB knockdown in promoting proliferation and invasion and inhibiting apoptosis, whereas anti-miR-21 or RhoB expression yielded opposite effects, in colorectal cancer cells. These results suggest that miR-21 is a regulator of RhoB expression and RhoB could be a useful target in exploring the potential therapeutic benefits of miR-21 mediated tumor cell behaviors in colorectal cancer.
