 BACKGROUND: The immunochemical faecal occult blood test (IFOBT) is widely performed for colorectal cancer screening, but the usefulness of IFOBT in the detection of disorders of the small intestine is unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate what proportion of IFOBT-positive subjects with negative colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy has pathologies of the small intestine detected by capsule endoscopy (CE). METHODS: Between October 2008 and June 2010, asymptomatic IFOBT-positive patients with negative total colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy underwent CE. CE findings were classified into three categories: P0 (no abnormalities, or findings without potential for bleeding), P1 (findings with uncertain potential for bleeding), P2 and (findings with high potential for bleeding). RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (37 males, 16 females; 52.1 Â± 13.0 years) were included. There were no cases with P2, 19 cases with P1, and 34 cases with P0 (there were no abnormalities in 25 of 34 cases). As a result, lesions in the small intestine were detected in 28 cases. Additional examination was considered necessary for five patients after CE, but no abnormality was detected, and therapeutic intervention was not undertaken in any case. Caecal completion rate was 92.5%. CONCLUSIONS: No significant pathologies of the small intestine were detected in asymptomatic IFOBT-positive cases with negative colonoscopy and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. CE is of limited use in asymptomatic patients with positive IFOBT.
