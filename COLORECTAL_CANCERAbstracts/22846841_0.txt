Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a common presentation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and the overall survival is poor. In most patients, the disease remains limited to the peritoneal cavity. Therefore, investigators have applied cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic perioperative chemotherapy as the standard approach for selected patients with peritoneal metastases from colorectal cancer. Overall, very promising long-term survival has been shown in a subset of patients with a limited extent of peritoneal disease before treatment. Whether randomised, controlled trials are needed to definitively show the magnitude of benefit, if any, of this approach is an important question. This Debate outlines the arguments on each side of this issue.
