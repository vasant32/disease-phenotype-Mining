 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of casein kinase 2β (ck2β) in colorectal cancer in relation to the metastatic ability of the cancer cells. METHODS: The expression of ck2β in 46 normal colorectal mucosa, 20 colorectal adenomas and 66 colorectal cancers were detected immunohistochemically. In colorectal cancer cells, Ck2β protein expression was knockdown by RNA interference using ck2β-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) and the interference efficiency was assessed by Western blotting. The effect of ck2β gene knockdown on the proliferation of the colorectal cancer cells was tested with colony formation assay, and the changes in the invasive ability of the cells were observed using Transwell chamber assay. RESULTS: Negative or weak ck2β expression was detected in normal colorectal mucosa, with nuclear positivity in 8.7% and cytoplasmic positivity in 13.0% of the cases. Colorectal adenomas showed moderate ck2β expression, with 60% cases showing positivity in the cell nuclei and 40% in the cytoplasm. In colorectal cancers, significantly stronger expression of ck2β was found than that in colorectal adenomas and normal colorectal mucosa (P<0.05), and 75.8% cases showed positivity in the cell nuclei and 62.1% showed cytoplasmic positivity; the expression of ck2β protein in colorectal cancers with lymph node metastasis was even higher (P<0.05). Ck2β knockdown obviously inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of colorectal cancer cells in vitro. CONCLUSION: The high expression of ck2β in colorectal cancer is closely correlated to the carcinogenesis and metastasis of the tumor.
