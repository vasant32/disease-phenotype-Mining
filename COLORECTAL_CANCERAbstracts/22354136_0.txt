 PURPOSE: Despite the Government's National Cancer Screening Program for colorectal cancer (CRC), the number of individuals participating in screening in Korea is low. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify associations between relevant risk factors and the uptake of screening in Korea. METHODS: The Health Interview Survey sub-dataset derived from the Fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES IV) was used to evaluate participation in CRC screening and factors associated with attendance in individuals aged ≥50. Those that completed the questionnaire and not previously diagnosed with CRC were enrolled (8,042 subjects). Multi-dimensional covariates were considered as potential predictors for CRC screening in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 33.2% complied with the CRC screening recommendations. The following were associated with participation: age (aged 70 or older [ref], aged 70 or over; odds ratio (OR) 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-2.14), marital status (OR 1.43, 95%CI 1.23-1.66), urban-dwelling (OR 1.16, 95%CI 1.02-1.32), education level (elementary school or less [ref], high school (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.09-1.53), university or higher (OR 1.53, 95%CI 1.23-1.91)), household income (fourth quartile [ref], first quartile (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.07-1.56)), private health insurance (OR 1.38, 95%CI 1.21-1.58), smoking (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.43-1.60), self-reported depression (OR 0.79, 95%CI 0.68-0.92), and number of chronic diseases (0-3 [ref], ≥4 (OR 1.41, 95%CI 1.22-1.62)). CONCLUSION: To improve participation in CRC screening, appropriate strategies must be directed toward vulnerable populations, such as those with low socioeconomic status.
