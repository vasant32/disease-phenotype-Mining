The object of the study is to provide an epidemiological overview of the impact of neoplasms in an area that has no cancer registry. A descriptive study was conducted within the Local Health Authority of Vercelli. To estimate the number of cases, hospital discharge documents (including passive mobility) were used and integrated with the archives of pathology. The number of cases was calculated on the basis of SIR (specific rates of the Vercelli Local Health Authority divided by age in the years 2002-2009 in comparison with new cases of cancer in the city of Turin from 2005 to 2007, used as standard population). All readings were expressed including intervals of confidence at 95%. For tumors of low lethality for males, extending the period of observation confirms the excess for bladder cancer (SIR = 1.1, 1.07 to 1.21) and lymphoma aggregate (SIR = 1.4, 1.2 to 1.6). for females: thyroid (SIR = 1.5, 1.3 to 1.65) and lymphomas (SIR = 1.25, 1.1 to 1.4). In addition to these tumors in both sexes is observed to decrease colorectal cancer but excess for leukemias and brain. The extension of the study is intended as the base for the creation of a cancer register that will be established, naturally integrating further sources of information. In all cases, data observed indicated several epidemiological peculiarities in the region, probably linked to specific characteristics of local exposure, which should be addressed in terms of Public Health.
