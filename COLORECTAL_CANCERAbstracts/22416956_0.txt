The Institute of Medicine recommended that all patients receive survivorship care plans (SCPs) post-treatment to improve quality of follow-up care. However, little is known regarding how survivors utilize SCPs and the congruency between providers' and survivors' perspectives. Feedback from colorectal cancer survivors (in receipt of a personalized/individualized SCP) and oncology providers was obtained via interviews. Survivors noted SCPs benefits of reduced duplicative procedures and cancer worry with the synthesized treatment information. Providers noted billing/reimbursement and time investiture (for form completion) as potential barriers. Further investigation of SCPs is warranted regarding utility prior to widespread adoption in follow-up care.
