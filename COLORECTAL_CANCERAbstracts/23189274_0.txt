Oxidative stress is one of several factors which contribute to the development of colorectal carcinogenesis. The aim of the study was an assessment of the activity of antioxidant enzymes in tumour and corresponding normal distal mucosa in a group of patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma. Samples of tumour and corresponding normal mucosa were obtained during a resection of colorectal cancer from 47 patients aged between 26 and 82 years. The average distance of corresponding normal distal mucosa from the tumour was 4.49 cm. Activities of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and catalase (CAT) were measured in tissue homogenates. The patients were grouped according to the tumour stage (Duke's staging), grading, localization, and size of tumour, as well as age and sex. Statistical analysis was performed. The activity of SOD and GPx was considerably increased, while the activity of GST decreased significantly in tumour as compared with normal mucosa. GR activity in colorectal cancer was evidently higher in tumours of proximal location compared with the distal ones. The distance of corresponding normal distal mucosa from the tumour was analyzed and related to all assayed parameters. A decreased GST activity was observed in corresponding normal mucosa more than 5 cm distant from the tumour in patients with CD Duke's stage. The higher activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in tumour compared to corresponding normal mucosa could indicate higher oxidative stress in colorectal adenocarcinoma cells.
