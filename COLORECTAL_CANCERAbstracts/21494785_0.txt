 BACKGROUND: Emerging data suggest that in the current era of modern systemic therapies, resection of colorectal liver metastases with concomitant extrahepatic disease may be a curative option in selected patients. METHODS: A commentary of several key recent papers including an international multi-institutional registry study may provide directions in the future management of this disease entity. RESULTS: The premise of selecting patients for a surgical approach to resect colorectal liver metastases and concomitant extrahepatic disease should be individualized. Incorporation of key prognostic factors that include the site of extrahepatic disease, the ability to undertake a complete resection, disease responding to chemotherapy, and an assessment of tumor biology through examining an individual's disease history may guide the selection of suitable patients for this therapeutic pursuit. A 5-year survival of 30% may be realized in well-selected patients. CONCLUSION: Concomitant extrahepatic disease in patients with colorectal liver metastases should not be a contraindication to resection of colorectal cancer metastases.
