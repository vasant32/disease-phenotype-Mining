Complete cell reprogramming can be achieved by the introduction of specific transcription factors, Oct4 [also known as POU class 5 homeobox 1 (Pou5f1)]; sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 2 (Sox2); Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4); and myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc), into terminally differentiated mouse somatic fibroblasts. This reprogramming process may be accelerated or suppressed by various factors, including microRNAs (miRNAs). Introduction of these transcription factors or miRNAs considerably modifies the malignant phenotype of cancer cells. We studied the effect of introducing these transcription factors into two distinct colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines, HCT116 and DLD-1, in the presence and absence of Dicer 1, ribonuclease type III (Dicer1), a critical miRNA processing enzyme. We assessed cell reprogramming based on the number of cells exhibiting alkaline phosphatase staining and an increase in embryonic stem cell-like gene expression, indicating the return of cells to an immature state. Dicer1-deficient CRC cells showed a reduced number of alkaline phosphatase-positive reprogrammed cells than wild-type (WT) cells. Before reprogramming, endogenous expression of an immature carbohydrate epitope, TRA-1-60, was high in Dicer1-deficient CRC cells, whereas after reprogramming, the expression of this epitope was increased in Dicer1-sufficient more than in Dicer1-deficient CRC cells. Our data demonstrate the critical role of miRNAs in the reprogramming process and determination of a differentiated phenotype of CRC cells.
