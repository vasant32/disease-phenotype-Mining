Translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases have low processivity and fidelity compared with replicative polymerases. Defective function of TLS polymerases result in chromosome instability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of TLS genes on susceptibility and metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs462779, rs11153292, rs373572 and rs2233004) of TLS genes were genotyped in the pilot cohort consisted of 516 patients with CRC and 503 controls, and then replicated in the replication cohort of 421 cases and 446 controls. The genotype frequencies of rs462779 and rs373572 were significantly different between CRC patients and controls in both two cohorts, even after it was adjusted by age, gender and smoking status. Stratified analysis showed that rs462779 and rs373572 were significantly associated with both colon and rectum cancer. In patients with metastatic CRC, the frequency of AA genotype of rs373572 was significantly increased as compared with those without metastasis CRC (P=0.001). Furthermore, rs462779 and rs373572 exhibited remarkably cumulative effect on the risk of CRC (trend P value=0.001). No significant difference was observed between other SNPs and CRC. These results suggest that polymorphisms in TLS genes are associated with susceptibility to CRC in Chinese and might be a novel biomarker for the predication of metastasis risk of CRC.
