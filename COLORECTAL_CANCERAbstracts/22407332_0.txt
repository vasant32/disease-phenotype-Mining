Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in both genders with a high             death rate, accounting for about 56,000 each year in the USA only. In this study             we examined the differences in CRC between the genders. We also looked for differences             in the staining of the tumors and adjacent colonic mucosa to estrogen receptor             β1 and its possible prognostic value. Fifty-five specimens from patients who underwent             resection of colon cancer in our institute were sectioned and stained for estrogen             receptor β1. The histopathological slides were evaluated for positive staining             in the tumor and the normal colonic mucosa as well. The results were statistically             analyzed. Positive estrogen receptor β1 stain was found in the nuclei of the tumor             cells. We noted positive stain also in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Similar             findings were observed in the normal colonic mucosa. Statistically significant             differences were found regarding the positivity of the staining between the deceased             and surviving patients, men/women and those who had metastases vs. the non-metastatic             ones. Our data suggest that there is an estrogen influence on the development             and progression of colon cancer. Furthermore, it was found to be higher in the             more severe cases.
