 BACKGROUND: There have been few studies of tailored interventions to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. PURPOSE: We conducted a randomized trial of a tailored, interactive intervention to increase CRC screening. METHODS: Patients 50-70 years completed a baseline survey, were randomized to one of three groups, and attended a wellness exam after being exposed to a tailored intervention about CRC screening (tailored group), a public web site about CRC screening (web site group), or no intervention (survey-only group). The primary outcome was completion of any recommended CRC screening by 6 months. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in screening by 6 months: 30%, 31%, and 28% of the survey-only, web site, and tailored groups were screened. Exposure to the tailored intervention was associated with increased knowledge and CRC screening self-efficacy at 2 weeks and 6 months. Family history, prior screening, stage of change, and physician recommendation moderated the intervention effects. CONCLUSIONS: A tailored intervention was not more effective at increasing screening than a public web site or only being surveyed.
