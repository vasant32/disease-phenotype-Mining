 BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the correlation between the expression of stem cell makers and prognosis in colorectal cancer. METHODOLOGY: Eligible studies evaluating the correlation between stem cell makers and prognosis were selected based on the references in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane libraries. Outcome measures included overall survival, relevant pathological parameters. Meta-analyses were performed by RevMan 5.0. RESULTS: Seventeen eligible articles involving 3098 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed CD44 expression is not significant difference of 5-year overall survival rate (OR=0.69, p=0.22) and relevant clinical parameters, such as histological grade (OR=1.98, p=0.06), dukes grade (OR=0.77, p=0.43) and metastasis (OR=1.03, p=0.89). Likewise, there is no correlation between CD44v6 and dukes stage (OR=0.56, p=0.23), metastasis (OR= 2.81, p=0.33), except for histological grade (OR=0.48, p=0.02). However, CD44v6 positive cells (OR=0.36, p=0.02) were significantly associated with poor overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current retrospective evidence, a stem cell maker, CD44 cannot become a prognostic marker in colorectal cancer. In contrast, CD44v6, an isoform of CD44 plays a significant role to predict clinic outcome.
