 BACKGROUND: Prognostic value of perioperative change in peripheral blood leukocyte subset count of cancer patients have not been fully investigated. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated the relation between perioperative change in peripheral blood monocyte count and disease-free as well as overall survival after hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). METHODS: The subjects were 64 patients who underwent hepatic resection for CRLM between January 2000 and December 2008. We retrospectively investigated the relation between perioperative change in peripheral blood monocyte count and disease-free as well as overall survival. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, more than four lymph node metastases (P = 0.0298) and extrahepatic disease (P = 0.0423) were significant predictors of disease-free survival, while significant predictor of overall survival were more than four lymph node metastases (P = 0.0011), bilobar disease (P = 0.0024), and increase in perioperative monocyte less than twice (P = 0.0029). Morover, increase in perioperative monocyte of less than twice positively correlated with intraoperative blood transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative change in peripheral blood monocyte count is an independent risk factor for overall survival after hepatic resection for CRLM, and may reflect immunosuppressive state.
