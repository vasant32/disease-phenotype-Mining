 UNLABELLED: AIM/PURPOSE: We investigated the expression of melanoma-associated antigen gene (MAGE), human synovial sarcoma on X chromosome (SSX) and their clinical implications in sporadic colon cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fresh tissue samples from 37 patients with colorectal adenocarcinomas were analyzed for MAGE and SSX mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and their paraffin-embedded tissues were used for immunohistochemistry for cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and survivin. RESULTS: Expression of MAGE and SSX was not detected in normal tissues. Colon cancer expressed SSX in 32.4% and MAGE in 51.4% of cases. Co-expression of MAGE and SSX was directly correlated with liver metastasis (p=0.024) and also correlated with nuclear expression of survivin (p=0.016), yet did not correlate with expression of COX2 and VEGF. Nuclear survivin expression (83.3%) was found in the cancer tissues exclusively. No significant relationships between the expression of COX2 (73.9%) and VEGF (72.4%) and other clinicopathologic variables were found. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that nuclear expression of survivin, lymph node metastasis, vascular and perineural invasion, and co-expression of MAGE and SSX may be associated with the metastasis of colorectal cancer to the liver.
