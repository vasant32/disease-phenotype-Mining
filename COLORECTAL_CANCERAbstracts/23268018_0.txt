The clinical outcomes, including adverse events, in 34 unresectable advanced colorectal cancer patients with wild-type K-ras, who were treated with bevacizumab and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy as a first-line treatment, were analyzed for confirmation of the effectiveness and safety of this treatment. The response rate of the patients was 44% (complete remission, 2 patients; and partial remission, 13 patients). The median progression-free survival and overall survival in these patients was 11.1 and 25.1 months, respectively. Adverse events of greater than grade 3 were observed in 18 patients. Of these patients, 10 exhibited grade 3/4 neutropenia, and 6 had peripheral neuropathy. Our results were similar to those of randomized phase III trials from abroad, including those using anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, with respect to effectiveness and safety. Furthermore, patients with liver metastasis had poor prognosis compared to those with metastasis to organs other than the liver. Further analysis will be required to better understand these results.
