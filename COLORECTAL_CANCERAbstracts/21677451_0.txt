 OBJECTIVES: The prophylactic effect of FOLFOX regimen, a standard regimen for unresectable colorectal cancer (CRC), was investigated in the adjuvant setting of CRC cases with distant metastases. METHODS: The study population included 116 CRC patients with synchronous metastases and 91 patients with metachronous metastases who had undergone curative operation in our hospital between 2000 and 2009. Clinicopathological parameters of CRC, postoperative chemotherapeutic regimen, recurrence rate, and relapse-free survival (RFS) were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: After resection of CRC and synchronous metastases, 53 (84%) out of 63 patients without chemotherapy, and 38 (83%) out of 46 that received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone or with leucovorin (LV) developed recurrent tumors. By contrast, only 1 (17%) among 6 patients who underwent FOLFOX treatment showed recurrence. The FOLFOX group exhibited significantly improved RFS as compared to the 5-FU (+ LV) or surgery-alone group (p = 0.03, p = 0.007, respectively). On the other hand, in patients with metachronous metastases, tumor-relapse rate and RFS were not significantly influenced by post-metastasectomy therapies. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, the adjuvant administration of FOLFOX appeared to reduce the risk of relapse in a small group of CRC patients with synchronous metastases. Prospective randomized trials will be required to confirm the benefits of this management strategy.
