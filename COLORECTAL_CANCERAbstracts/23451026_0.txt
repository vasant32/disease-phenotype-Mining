 BACKGROUND: Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that elderly patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) can benefit from chemotherapy, yet compliance in real-world practice is low. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, compliance and reasons for refusal of postoperative chemotherapy for elderly patients with CRC and to provide corresponding strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinico-pathological and biochemical data of the chemotherapy group and chemo-refusing group were compared among 386 elderly patients (>70 years old) with CRC who underwent surgery. 226 patients received chemotherapy and 160 patients refused. Follow-up of the subjective reasons for refusal was investigated using the elderly cancer patients' chemo-refusal reason questionnaire (ECPCRRQ) prepared by the authors and a group of psychologists. The questionnaire is administrated by telephone. A predictive model for 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) was constructed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis, logistic and Cox regression. RESULTS: Among stage III patients, receiving chemotherapy was associated with a significantly higher OS (68%) compared to those who refused ( OS 50%) (HR: 2.05, 95%CI: 1.12-3.77, P = 0.02). The Chemo-refusal group had more female and elderly patients, significantly higher rate of severe complications, and lower body mass index (BMI). Follow-up phone questionnaire analysis showed the doctors' uncertainty of chemotherapy benefit, economic difficulties, uncomfortable feeling, superstition of Traditional Chinese Medicine, concealing information and lack of social support were the main factors for elderly CRC patients to decline chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The receipt of post-operative chemotherapy in elderly patients with resected stage III CRC was associated with a more favorable survival. The low compliance rate (160/386) of postoperative chemotherapy was influenced by various subjective and objective factors.
