 AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the correlation between time-intensity curve (TIC) parameters and colorectal tumour angiogenesis using double contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCEUS), in which an intraluminal contrast agent was used in combination with an intravascular contrast agent. METHOD: Thirty nine patients with colorectal tumours were examined preoperatively. During hydrocolonal examination with the intraluminal contrast agent, an intravascular contrast agent, SonoVue, was used to perform the DCEUS. The parameter arrival time (AT), time to peak (TTP), peak intensity (PI) and area under the curve (AUC) were measured. Postoperative specimens were assessed for microvessel density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The correlation between TIC parameters and the expression of VEGF or MVD was studied. RESULTS: The mean values of AT, TTP, PI and AUC of the colorectal tumours were 14.32 ± 11.36 s, 30.61 ± 18.65 s, 20.38 ± 17.45 dB and 221.10 ± 156.09 dB.s, respectively. Both AUC and MVD were significantly higher in colorectal adenocarcinomas than in adenomas (all P < 0.05). A positive linear correlation was found between the AUC and MVD in colorectal tumours (r = 0.686, P = 0.0019). No correlation was found between VEGF and any TIC parameter. CONCLUSION: DCEUS is a valuable method for evaluating angiogenesis in colorectal tumours in vivo. The AUC has a positive linear correlation with MVD and could form a new index for assessing angiogenesis and the biological behaviour of colorectal tumours.
