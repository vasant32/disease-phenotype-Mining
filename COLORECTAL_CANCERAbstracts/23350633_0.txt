AIM: Patients with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) seem to have a better prognosis than those with sporadic colon cancer (CC)s. The aim was to compare survival after stage III CC in patients with HNPCC with those having sporadic CC. METHOD: 230 patients with hereditary cancer from The Danish HNPCC-Register and 3557 patients with sporadic CC from The Danish Colorectal Cancer Database, diagnosed during May 2001-December 2008 were included. HNPCC patients were classified according to Mismatch Repair mutation status and family pedigree. Sporadic cases had no known family history of cancer. Patient characteristics, geographic differences and survival data were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall survival (OS) was better in HNPCC patients compared to sporadic CC after stratification for sex and age (p=0.02; CI 1.04-1.7). The 5-year survival was 70% in HNPCC patients compared with 56% in sporadic CC (p<0.001). No survival difference was found between HNPCC subgroups but a tendency of better OS was seen in patients with Lynch syndrome. No geographic differences in OS were found. The median follow-up was 3.9 (0-9.5) years for HNPCC vs 3.2 (0-9.6) years for sporadic CC. CONCLUSION: HNPCC patients with stage III CC have a better OS compared with sporadic CC. Within HNPCC subgroups, no significant difference in OS was found. © 2013 The Authors. Colorectal Disease © 2013 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.
