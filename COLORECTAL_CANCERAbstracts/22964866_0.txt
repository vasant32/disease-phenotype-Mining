BACKGROUND:: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer in Taiwan. Colorectal cancer screening can prevent or detect cancer early, but the acceptance rate in rural southern Taiwan is unknown. OBJECTIVE:: The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of CRC screening and related factors in rural south Taiwan. METHODS:: Cross-sectional study was conducted. Sample population was recruited from 2 rural areas in southern Taiwan. A structured questionnaire was completed by 635 participants. The following outcomes were studied: sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of CRC screening, acceptance of CRC screening, and the reasons for having or not having CRC screening. RESULTS:: The results indicated that 4.7% of the respondents had undergone a fecal occult blood test, 3.1% had undergone a sigmoidoscopy, and 2.7% had undergone a colonoscopy. For overall CRC screening, knowledge that CRC was the most common form of cancer was significant (P < .01). Among participants who knew that CRC was the most common form of cancer, the odds of undergoing CRC screening were 4.20-fold greater than among participants who did not know that CRC was the most common form of cancer (P < .01; confidence interval, 1.62-10.89). CONCLUSIONS:: This study demonstrates that the acceptance of CRC screening among men remains higher than among women in rural southern Taiwan. Efforts to improve CRC screening in rural areas should focus on increasing community residents' knowledge about cancer incidence and prevention. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:: Colorectal cancer screening is a useful cancer prevention measure, and community health center nurses should assess and promote rural residents' acceptance for CRC screening.
