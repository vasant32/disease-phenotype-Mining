 BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) on liver metastases of Stage III colorectal cancer patients after curative resection. METHODOLOGY: We randomly assigned 287 Stage III colorectal cancer patients after curative resection between 2002 and 2008 to receive 2 cycles of HAIC plus 4 cycles of systemic chemotherapy (combined therapy) or 6 cycles of systemic chemotherapy alone (monotherapy). Both the HAIC and systemic chemotherapy regimen consisted of a 2-hour infusion of Oxaliplatin (85mg/m2) on day 1 followed by folinic acid 200mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on days 2 and 3 and by 5-fluorouracil 2400mg/m2 as a 48-hour infusion on days 2 and 3. The treatment repeated every 4 weeks. The disease-free survival, overall survival and liver metastases-free survival were compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in adverse effects between two groups. Significant differences were found in 3-year disease-free survival (Combined therapy, 75.00%; Monotherapy, 63.27%; p=0.0035), overall survival (Combined therapy, 84.29%; Monotherapy, 65.31%; p=0.0006) and liver metastases-free survival (Combined therapy, 80.00%; Monotherapy, 69.39%; p=0.0451). CONCLUSIONS: HAIC effectively and safely prevents metachronous liver metastases and improves the prognosis of patients with Stage III colorectal cancer after curative resection.
