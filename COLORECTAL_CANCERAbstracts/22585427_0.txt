BACKGROUND: We evaluated the safety, efficacy, and compliance of 1-year treatment with S-1 in patients with stage II/III resectable colorectal cancer. METHODS: S-1 was administered orally in two divided doses daily. The dose was assigned according to body surface area (BSA) as follows: BSA <1.25 m(2), 80 mg/day; BSA ≥1.25 to <1.5 m(2), 100 mg/day; and BSA ≥1.5 m(2), 120 mg/day. S-1 was given for 28 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day rest. The study objects were the rate of completion of treatment as planned at 1 year, the ratio of the actually administered dose to the planned dose at 1 year, and the total number of days of treatment. RESULTS: At 1 year, the rate of completion of treatment as planned was 77.7 % (42/54 patients), and the ratio of the actually administered dose to the planned dose was 82.9 %. The mean and median total numbers of days of treatment were 209 and 252, respectively. Grade 3 or higher toxicity (watery eyes) occurred in only 1 patient. CONCLUSION: S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy had acceptable compliance, safety, and efficacy in patients with colorectal cancer. S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy is considered a possible standard treatment regimen for colorectal cancer.
