Quaking (QKI) proteins are important regulators of RNA metabolism and cellular signal transduction. Recent studies have shown that isoforms of QKI proteins, which include QKI5/6/7/7b in human cells, play important roles in the development of neurological diseases and human cancers. In comparison with QKI5/6/7, however, there are little data on QKI7b due to lack of specific antibodies. Here, we reported the preparation and initial characterizations of polyclonal antibodies against human QKI7b. Utilizing a chemically synthesized C-terminal peptide fragment of human QKI7b, we raised two preparations of rabbit antiserum. We found that these antibodies were able to recognize human QKI7b, but not QKI5/6/7. Our immunofluorescence staining showed that in LO2 hepatocytes, QKI7b localizes predominantly in the perinuclear cytoplasm and less abundantly in the nucleus. In clinical samples, we showed that like QKI5/6/7 proteins, QKI7b protein was also significantly downregulated in most human colorectal cancer tissues. These antibodies, therefore, might be useful in future functional studies of QKI7b.
