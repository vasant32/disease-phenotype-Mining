 BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutic options for patients with metastasised colorectal cancer and impaired liver function are limited. Although oxaliplatin and 5-FU are well tolerated as single therapeutic agents, data supporting their use as combination chemotherapy in the setting of severe hepatic dysfunction are insufficient. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Here, we report on 2 patients with colorectal cancer and severe liver dysfunction secondary to hepatic metastases. On admission both patients displayed a bilirubin of > 22 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase (AP) of > 350 U/L as signs of extensive hepatic tumor spread. We initiated a 5-FU/oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy in both patients. RESULTS: Liver function and clinical performance improved dramatically within the first cycles of therapy in both patients. On radiologic evaluation, we observed 1 partial response and one long-term (10 months) disease stabilization. The toxicity was acceptable in both patients. CONCLUSION: We concluded that oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapies (eg FOLFOX4) may achieve good tumor response without significant side effects in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and hepatic dysfunction.
