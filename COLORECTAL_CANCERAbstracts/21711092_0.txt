The glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme encoded by the GSTP1 gene is one of the critical enzymes involved in detoxification of carcinogens. The substitution of isoleucine to valine residue at position 105 of the GSTP1 protein results in decreased enzyme activity and hence less capability of effective detoxification. Hence, we investigated the role of GSTP1 I105V polymorphism in modulating the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) associated in a Kashmiri population. We designed a case-control study in which 86 CRC cases were studied for GSTP1 I105V polymorphism against 160 controls taken from the general population employing the polymerase chain reaction-restriction length fragment polymorphism technique. There was no significant association between GSTP1 I105V genotypes and the disease, but the Val/Val genotype was associated with an increased risk with some clinicopathological parameters (odds ratio=1.5; 95% confidence interval=0.55-4.57). This study suggests that the GSTP1 I105V polymorphism may modulate CRC risk in the Kashmiri population.
