The aim of this study was to identify novel and reliable serum markers related             to the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and to assess the association             between selected markers and clinical outcome. We performed experiments using             cytokine arrays to investigate the cytokine profiles in serum from stage IV CRC             patients, compared with those of stage I patients. Serum CXCL10 was measured using             an ELISA in 218 CRC patients and 17 normal volunteers to clarify the association             of CXCL10 with clinical outcome. The mean serum CXCL10 concentration in CRC patients             was significantly higher compared to that in normal volunteers. Serum CXCL10 levels             increased significantly in accordance with the progression of UICC stage classification.             Serum CXCL10 was significantly associated with high pathological T stage, the             presence of vascular invasion and distant metastasis. Elevated serum CXCL10 levels             were significantly associated with poor survival in all stages or in stage I-III             with curative patients, respectively, and were an independent marker in predicting             liver metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CXCL10 was expressed             in cancer cells at primary tumor and liver metastases sites, and in normal liver             tissue surrounding metastatic cancer cells. Comprehensive analysis using cytokine             arrays identified the novel serum prognosis marker CXCL10. Preoperative high serum             levels of CXCL10 were associated with poor prognosis and liver metastasis in CRC.
