We analyzed 170 tumors (polypoid, 98; non-polypoid, 72) of early colorectal carcinoma with or without submucosal invasions (Tis and T1 of TNM classification) from 161 patients to evaluate correlations between clinicopathological factors and immunohistochemical expressions of CD10, MUC2, and MUC5AC. The coexistence of adenomatous components was significantly less common in non-polypoid carcinomas (4.2%) than in polypoid carcinomas (66.3%) (P < 0.0001). Non-polypoid carcinomas were smaller in size and tended to infiltrate into the submucosa with higher incidence of lymphatic and venous permeations. CD10 was more frequently expressed in non-polypoid carcinomas (70.8%) than in polypoid carcinomas (51.0%) (P= 0.01). Total carcinomas with high grade atypia showed higher incidence of CD10 expression (60.6%) than those with low grade atypia (28.9%) (P < 0.0001). Carcinomas with low grade atypia exhibited a higher incidence of MUC2 and MUC5AC expression (91.1% and 57.8%, respectively), when compared with carcinomas with high grade atypia (41.6% and 20.0%, respectively) (both, P < 0.0001). In submucosal invasive carcinomas with residual intramucosal carcinoma component (IMCC), CD10 expression in IMCC and submucosal invasive carcinoma component (SMCC) simultaneously exhibited identical positive or negative results, regardless of the polypoid or non-polypoid growth pattern. The CD10 expression may occur in the early stage of carcinogenesis within the mucosa, and these neoplasms may retain CD10 in SMCC, possibly resulting in more advanced stages of stromal invasion and distant metastases. In conclusion, our data suggest that the CD10 expression and mucin phenotypes may be potentially useful markers for estimating biological properties of early colorectal carcinomas.
