 BACKGROUND: No standard treatment exists for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed after treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, irinotecan and an anti-EGFR antibody. The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab and capecitabine in heavily pre-treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, who had been exposed to 5-FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan in the first- and second line setting and mainly with irinotecan and cetuximab as third line treatment, were treated with capecitabine and bevacizumab. Four patients had received bevacizumab earlier. RESULTS: From January 2009 to August 2010 34 patients started treatment with capecitabine and bevacizumab. The combination was well tolerated. Progression free survival was 5.4 months and median overall survival was 12.2 months. CONCLUSION: The combination of capecitabine and bevacizumab was safe with an acceptable toxicity profile and induced a significant rate of disease control in heavily pre-treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
