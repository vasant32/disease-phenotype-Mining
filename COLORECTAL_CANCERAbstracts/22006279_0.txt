Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is still the only routinely used biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC), but its utility is hampered by poor specificity and sensitivity, and the search for novel biomarkers is highly warranted. The nonspecific cross-reacting antigen 2 (NCA-2), a truncated CEA species molecule which is transcribed from the same gene, has been suggested as an alternative biomarker to CEA. In the present work, specific immunofluorometric assays were used for detection of NCA-2 and full-length CEA in bone marrow plasma from 277 CRC patients to assess their value as prognostic biomarkers, and detection was also performed in tumor tissue and a CRC cell line. Elevated plasma CEA was associated with advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and adverse patient outcome, while for NCA-2, although the same trends were observed, no additional prognostic information was gained. While specific detection of NCA-2 was clearly achieved in plasma samples, cross-reactivity with full-length CEA was observed when the antigen was exposed to common fixation chemicals. The results from this study indicate that NCA-2 is probably not a prognostic biomarker in CRC and, furthermore, underline the issue of antibody specificity when investigating CEA species molecules.
