The patient was a 77-year-old woman with multiple liver metastases of sigmoid colon cancer. She underwent low anterior resection for sigmoid colon cancer. After surgery, she selected oral administration of UFT and LV for liver metastases and multiple lymph node metastases. After two courses, the liver metastases had markedly diminished. Thirty-two months later, liver metastases had disappeared on computer tomography. This therapy was continued for five years, and recurrences are no longer shown. Severe adverse effects were not observed. Oral anti-cancer drugs can serve as effective therapy for advanced colorectal cancer of old patients.
