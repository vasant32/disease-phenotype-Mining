CONTEXT: Prescription of opioid analgesics is a key component of pain management among persons with cancer at the end of life. OBJECTIVES: To use a population-based method to assess the use of opioid analgesics within the community among older persons with colorectal cancer (CRC) before death and determine factors associated with the use of opioid analgesics. METHODS: Data were derived from a retrospective, linked administrative database study of all persons who were diagnosed with CRC between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2005 in Nova Scotia, Canada. This study included all persons who 1) were 66 years or older at the date of diagnosis; 2) died between January 1, 2001 and April 1, 2008; and 3) resided in health districts with formal palliative care programs (PCPs) (n=657). Factors associated with having filled at least one prescription for a so-called "strong" opioid analgesic in the six months before death were examined using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In all, 36.7% filled at least one prescription for any opioid in the six months before death. Adjusting for all covariates, filling a prescription for a strong opioid was associated with enrollment in a PCP (odds ratio [OR]=3.18, 95% CI=2.05-4.94), residence in a long-term care facility (OR=2.19, 95% CI=1.23-3.89), and a CRC cause of death (OR=1.75, 95% CI=1.14-2.68). Persons were less likely to fill a prescription for a strong opioid if they were older (OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.95-0.99), male (OR=0.59, 95% 0.40-0.86), and diagnosed less than six months before death (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.41-0.93). CONCLUSION: PCPs may play an important role in enabling access to end-of-life care within the community.
