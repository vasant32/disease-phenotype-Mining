Evaluation of: Kanaan Z, Rai SN, Eichenberger MR et al. Plasma MiR-21: a potential diagnostic marker of colorectal cancer. Ann. Surg. 256(3), 544-551 (2012). Few studies have assessed circulating miRNAs in the blood of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. In the evaluated article, Kanaan et al. demonstrated that miR-21 may be a promising diagnostic plasma biomarker for CRC. They assessed miRNAs dysregulated in both tissue and blood samples from patients with CRC. A high-throughput microarray was used to first detect miRNAs deregulated in CRC compared with adjacent normal tissue. The three most upregulated and downregulated miRNAs were then measured in blood samples. Plasma miR-21 was able to correctly identify CRC with 90% specificity and sensitivity. In this article, we have considered the use of miRNAs as blood-based biomarkers for CRC.
