So the Scottish poet Robert Burns drew an analogy between the suffering of a field mouse whose nest has been overturned by a plough to the unexpected way in which human life can be disrupted by events beyond our control. Burns is saying that mice and humans facing unforseen catastrophes such as cancer have much in common. Unfortunately, whilst it is clear that there are some similarities between mouse models of cancer and cancer as seen in the clinic, the artificial conditions presented by animal models are very different to those found in humans with cancer. It cannot be assumed that even basic pathophysiologic processes found in animal models are anything more than a model (literally a 'likeness') of similar processes found in the clinic. With these caveats, Barone et al's paper published in this edition of Colorectal Disease (REF1) provides important insights into the pathophysiology of cytokeratin positive cells in the bone marrow of patients with colorectal cancer. © 2013 The Authors.
