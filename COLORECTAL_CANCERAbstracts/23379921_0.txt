Introduction: The immediate early response gene X-1 (IEX-1) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and metabolism. Deregulation of IEX-1 expression has been confirmed in multiple cancers in humans, in association with either poor or better prognosis depending on the type and progression stages of the cancer. Areas covered: This review summarizes clinical studies of altered IEX-1 expression in ovarian, pancreatic, blood, breast and colorectal cancers, lymphoma and myeloma. The authors also outline the current understandings of the complex functions of IEX-1 gained from studies with animal models and tumor cell lines so as to help us comprehend the significance of the clinical findings. Expert opinion: IEX-1 holds great promise to be a valuable biomarker, either alone or in combination with other genes, for monitoring progression of some cancers. IEX-1 expression is highly sensitive to environmental cues and distinct between normal and cancer cells. However, use of IEX-1 as a biomarker remains a significant challenge because too little is understood about the mechanism underlying the diverse activities of IEX-1 and a standardized clinical assay for IEX-1 detection and validation of clinical results across different studies are still critically lacking.
