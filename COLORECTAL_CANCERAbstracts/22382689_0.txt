 BACKGROUND: To evaluate a treatment protocol with repeated transarterial-chemoembolisation (TACE) downsizing before MR-guided laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) using different chemotherapeutic combinations in patients with unresectable colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-four patients were included in the current study. Transarterial-chemoembolisation (mean 3.4 sessions per patient) was performed as a downsizing treatment to meet the LITT requirements (number5, diameter <5 cm). The intra-arterial protocol consisted of either Irinotecan and Mitomycin (n=77), Gemcitabine and Mitomycin (n=49) or Mitomycin alone (n=98) in addition to Lipiodol and Embocept in all patients. Post TACE, all patients underwent LITT (mean 2.2 sessions per patient). RESULTS: Overall, TACE resulted in a mean reduction in diameter of the target lesions of 21.4%. The median time to progression was 8 months, calculated from the start of therapy and the median local tumour control rate was 7.5 months, calculated as of therapy completion. Median survival of patients calculated from the beginning of TACE was 23 months (range 4-110 months), in patients treated with Irinotecan and Mitomycin the median was 22.5 months, Gemcitabine and Mitomycin 23 months and Mitomycin only 24 months with a statistically significant difference between the groups (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Repeated TACE offers adequate downsizing of CRC liver metastases to allow further treatment with LITT. The combined treatment illustrates substantial survival rates and high local tumour control with statistically significant differences between the three protocols used. Further randomised trials addressing the current study results are required.
