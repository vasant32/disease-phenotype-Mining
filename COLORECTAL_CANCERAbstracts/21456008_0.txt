 BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that BRAF mutant cancers represent a discrete subset of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) defined by poorer survival. This study investigates whether BRAF mutant CRC is further defined by a distinct pattern of metastatic spread and explores the impact of BRAF mutation and microsatellite instability (MSI) on prognosis in metastatic CRC. METHODS: By using prospective clinical data and molecular analyses from 2 major centers (Royal Melbourne Hospital and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center), patients with known BRAF mutation status were analyzed for clinical characteristics, survival, and metastatic sites. RESULTS: The authors identified 524 metastatic CRC patients where BRAF mutation status was known; 57 (11%) were BRAF mutant tumors. BRAF mutant tumors were significantly associated with right-sided primary tumor, MSI, and poorer survival (median, 10.4 months vs 34.7 months, P < .001). A distinct pattern of metastatic spread was observed in BRAF mutant tumors, namely higher rates of peritoneal metastases (46% vs 24%, P = .001), distant lymph node metastases (53% vs 38%, P = .008), and lower rates of lung metastases (35% vs 49%, P = .049). In additional survival analyses, MSI tumors had significantly poorer survival compared with microsatellite stable tumors (22.1 months vs 11.1 months, P = .017), but this difference was not evident in the BRAF mutant population. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of metastatic spread observed in this study further defines BRAF mutant CRC as a discrete disease subset. The authors demonstrated that, unlikely early stage disease, MSI is associated with poorer survival in metastatic CRC, although this is driven by its association with BRAF mutation.
