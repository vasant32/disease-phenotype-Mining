 PURPOSE: The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been increasing in Asian countries including Thailand. Double contrast barium enema (DCBE) is one of the investigation tools used in CRC screening. This study aimed to determine the incidence of colorectal neoplasm detected at screening by DCBE in Thai people. METHODS: The computerized radiology database of screening DCBE in Thai adults between June 2009 and October 2011 at the Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, was reviewed. DCBE examination performed in a surveillance program after curative CRC resection or the removal of colorectal polyps was also considered as a screening DCBE. RESULTS: A total of 819 screening DCBEs performed during this 28-month period were analyzed. The mean age of patients was 59.8 âˆ“ 13.6 years. Of the total, 467 (57%) were male. A family history of CRC and a previous history of curative CRC resection or polyp removal were noted in 34 patients (4%) and 124 patients (15%), respectively. A total of 31 patients (3.8%; 95%CI = 2.7%-5.3%) were reported to have colorectal polyp or mass demonstrated on DCBE. Of these, follow-up endoscopy was performed in 20 cases (65%). According to pathological results, the incidence of advanced adenoma and CRC detected at screening DCBE was 0.7% (95%CI = 0.3%-1.6%; n=6) and 0.4% (95%CI = 0.1%-1.1%; n=3), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The screening DCBE performed in Thai adults had a diagnostic yield of 0.7% for advanced adenoma and 0.4% for CRC.
