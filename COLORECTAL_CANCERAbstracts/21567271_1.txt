Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the major causes of cancer-related morbidity, mortality, and human health problem worldwide. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in different genes are reported to be effective in increased risk of CRC in different ethnic population. We conducted a case-control study in patients diagnosed with sporadic colorectal cancer (n = 115) and healthy controls based on colonoscopy evidences (n = 120).In this replicative study, we aimed to investigate the association of two previously reported polymorphisms, rs6983267 and rs4444903, with sporadic colorectal cancer in a subset of Iranian patients. Genotyping was performed via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. A significant relation was found between rs6983267 variant in the 8q24 region and colorectal cancer. The distribution of G/G genotypes among sporadic CRC patients was more frequent than that in the control group (P value = 0.001). The frequency of the G allele in the colorectal cancer patient group was also higher than that in the control group (65% vs. 48%; P value = 0.001). Compared with GG genotype, individuals with G/T and T/T genotypes had lower risk to develop sporadic CRC (OR = 0.357, 95% CI = 0.201-0.635). For the rs4444903 SNP, no significant association (P value = 0.149) was found with colorectal cancer risk. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the 8q24 rs6983267 SNP may play a pivotal role in the development of sporadic CRC in Iranian population. Therefore, it may be included as a potential genetic susceptibility marker for sporadic CRC.
