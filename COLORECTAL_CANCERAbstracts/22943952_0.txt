 OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between the expression of transgelin-2 and the clinicopathological factors of colorectal carcinoma and evaluate the value of transgelin-2 in prognostic assessment of the colorectal cancer patients. METHODS: Using tissue microarray and immunohistochemical methods, we examined transgelin-2 of 120 colorectal cancer patients received surgical treatment from September 2002 to April 2004, including 74 male and 46 female, age from 26 to 89 years. Analyzed the relationship between transgelin-2 and both the clinicpathologcial features and prognosis of the colorectal cancer by using χ² test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Cox proportion hazard regression analysis was used to study the independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: The positive rate of transgelin-2 expression was 69.2% in colorectal carcinoma. The transgelin-2 expression correlated with differentiation degree (χ² = 5.420), lymph nodes metastasis (χ² = 45.577), distant metastasis (χ² = 12.009), and TNM staging (χ² = 47.577). The survival time was (39 ± 5) months in patients with positive expression of the trangelin-2, while (59 ± 3) months in patients with negative expression. The patient's survival time was statistically correlated with the transgelin-2 expression (P = 0.003). Distant metastasis (RR = 8.318, 95%CI: 4.119 - 16.790), lymph nodes metastasis (RR = 2.794, 95%CI: 1.246 - 6.263) and transgelin-2 expression (RR = 1.834, 95%CI: 1.118- 2.973) were independent prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of transgelin-2 is correlated with clinicopathological features and prognosis in colorectal cancer, may be the potential marker of metastasis and the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients.
