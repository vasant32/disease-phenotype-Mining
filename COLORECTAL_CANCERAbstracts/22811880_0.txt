The management of colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases is a common clinical problem. If patients can undergo resection of liver metastases, long-term survival can be achieved. Converting a patient from unresectable to resectable, however, remains a major challenge. The majority of patients who undergo liver resection for colorectal metastases recur; therefore, adjuvant treatment following resection should be considered. Emerging literature suggests that hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) can be combined with systemic chemotherapy. Both therapies can be given at nearly full doses, thus improving resectability and outcomes for patients with colorectal liver metastases. HAI plus systemic can also be a useful option for adjuvant treatment after hepatic resection.
