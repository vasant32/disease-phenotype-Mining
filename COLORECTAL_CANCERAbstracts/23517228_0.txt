BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for screening of colorectal cancer (CRC) do not offer specific recommendations for cessation of antithrombotic agents prior to fecal occult blood test (FOBT). AIM: To asess the accuracy of FOBT in patients taking ASA or warfarin. METHODS: A literature search was conducted for studies that investigated the accuracy of FOBT in patients taking ASA and warfarin. The primary outcome was the pooled relative risk (RR) for true positive FOBT for detecting significant colonic neoplasia in patients taking ASA or warfarin compared to controls. The secondary outcome was a pooled RR for true positive in g-FOBT compared to i-FOBT. RESULTS: Five observational studies included 759 patients taking ASA and 1652 control subjects. In patients taking ASA, pooled RR for true positive FOBT was 0.82 (95% CI 0.73-0.93, p=0.0009), pooled RR for true positive g-FOBT was 0.69 (95% CI 0.60-0.79, p<0.0001) whereas pooled RR for true positive i-FOBT was 1.013 (95% CI 0.81-1.30, p=0.8182). Five observational studies included 806 patients taking warfarin and 10 338 control subjects. In patients taking warfarin, pooled RR for true positive FOBT was 1.559 (95% CI 1.349-1.801, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The results of our meta-analysis demonstrate in patients taking ASA, there is a decrease in the PPV of g-FOBT, but no significant difference in the PPV of i-FOBT compared to control subjects for detecting significant neoplasia. In patients taking warfarin, the PPV of FOBT was increased for detection of CRC compared to control subjects.
