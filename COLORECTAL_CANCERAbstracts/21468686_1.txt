 BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin is frequently used in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Our previous work shows that oxaliplatin induces the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa in CRC cells. The Bcl2-inhibitor ABT-737 is particularly effective in cells with high Noxa levels. Therefore, we tested whether oxaliplatin and ABT-737 display synergy in killing CRC cells. METHODS: A panel of CRC cell lines was treated with oxaliplatin and ABT-737, either alone or in combination. Apoptosis was measured by FACS analysis of sub-G1 DNA content and by Western blot analysis of caspase-3 processing. Noxa expression was suppressed by lentiviral RNA interference. RESULTS: Oxaliplatin and ABT-737 displayed a strong synergistic apoptotic response, which was dependent on wildtype TP53 and oncogenic KRAS. TP53 and KRAS were required for drug-induced Noxa expression and this was essential for tumor cell apoptosis. Oxaliplatin, but not ABT-737, induced p53 accumulation, but both drugs stimulated Noxa expression. Combination treatment of mice with subcutaneous tumor xenografts drastically reduced tumor volume, while single drug treatment had no effect. CONCLUSION: ABT-737 synergizes with oxaliplatin to kill colorectal cancer cells. This requires induction of Noxa by wildtype TP53 and oncogenic KRAS. Future studies should explore the anti-tumor efficacy of this drug combination in mouse models for spontaneous CRC development and in patient-derived tumor cell cultures and xenografts.
