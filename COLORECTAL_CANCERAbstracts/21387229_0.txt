 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer occurs more frequently in older patients. Since the older population is increasing, a better understanding of the characteristics of colorectal neoplasm according to the age would be useful. AIM: To determine the differences of clinical characteristics of colorectal neoplasm including polyps between the elderly and young patients. METHODS: Colonoscopy database from 2004 to 2008 was retrospectively analyzed. There were 1510 eligible patients who underwent colonoscopy with a mean age of 54 years. Patients were classified into two groups: the older age group (Group 1, aged Â³ 60 years, n = 626) and the younger age group (Group 2, aged < 60 years, n = 884). Data were recorded on age, gender, colonoscopic indications, colonoscopic findings, and their related histological findings and tumor location. RESULTS: The risk of finding polyps and cancer at colonoscopy increases with age (29.4% in the older age group and 11% in the younger age group (p < 0.05). Left-sided lesions were noted to be more frequent in both age groups (66% and 67% respectively). CONCLUSION: The chance of detecting colorectal neoplasm by colonoscopy was higher in the elderly. However, both groups had the lesions predominately located in the left side.
