Skin rash is an early and frequent phenomenon during treatment with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies. The objective of this review is to assess the predictive value of skin rash in patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab and panitumumab. We searched PubMed and ASCO Meetings for publications reporting the correlation of skin rash with survival and/or response rate. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95 % confidence intervals for progression and/or survival, and/or risk ratios (RRs) for response rate in patients with rash were obtained from publications and pooled in a meta-analysis. Fourteen publications (for a total of 3,833 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. The occurrence of skin toxicity represents a predictive factor for survival (HR 0.51; p < 0.00001) and progression (HR 0.58; p < 0.00001). Similarly, patients who developed moderate or severe rash had an increased chance of response (35 vs 13 %; RR 2.23, p < 0.00001). The occurrence of skin rash during treatment with cetuximab and panitumumab represents a significant predictor of the efficacy of these drugs. The hypothesis that, in patients who lack substantial skin toxicity, this treatment is not beneficial and requires early discontinuation deserves further study.
