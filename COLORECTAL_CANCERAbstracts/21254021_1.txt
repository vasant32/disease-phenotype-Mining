 BACKGROUND: Palliative resection of the primary tumour in asymptomatic patients with stage IV colorectal cancer is associated with improved survival and fewer complications. Laparoscopic surgery is widely employed in the curative treatment of colorectal cancer, but its value in advanced colorectal cancer remains unclear. METHODS: All patients who underwent laparoscopic resection of primary colorectal cancer in this unit between June 1991 and Jan 2010 were entered into a prospective computerized database. Outcomes for patients with laparoscopic resection of stage IV colorectal cancer were compared with those of patients who had laparoscopic surgery for stage I disease. RESULTS: Some 185 patients with stage IV colorectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic resection were compared with 310 patients who had stage I colorectal cancer. Some 94·1 and 98·4 per cent of operations respectively were completed laparoscopically. Hospital stay was slightly longer in the group with stage IV disease (mean 6·2 versus 5·3 days; P = 0·091). The 30-day mortality rate was 2·7 per cent in patients with stage IV disease and 0·6 per cent in those with stage I tumours (P = 0·061). There was no difference in complications. One-year survival rates were 77·8 and 99·0 per cent respectively (P < 0·001). CONCLUSION: Short-term outcomes after laparoscopic surgery for stage IV colorectal cancer in selected patients are equivalent to those for stage I cancers.
