 PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of caspase-10 mRNA expression in stage II colorectal cancer. METHODS: Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze caspase-10 expression in cancer tissue and corresponding normal mucosa from 120 patients with stage II colorectal cancer. Variables were analyzed by Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Survival was evaluated with method of Kaplan-Meier. Multivariate analysis was performed with Cox's proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The expression of caspase-10 mRNA was found to be downregulated in cancer tissue compared to normal mucosa (P = 0.001). Poorly differentiated cancer showed lower mRNA expression than cancer with greater differentiation (P = 0.031). Univariate survival curves, estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier, defined a significant association between caspase-10 expression and both overall survival (P = 0.012) and disease-free survival (P = 0.021). A multivariate analysis, performed by Cox's proportional hazards regression model, confirmed that a low caspase-10 expression was the only significant factor to predict poor prognosis in patients with stage II colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that caspase-10 expression, measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, is a possible prognostic factor in patients with stage II colorectal cancer.
