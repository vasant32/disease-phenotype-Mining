 OBJECTIVE: Deoxyribonucleoside kinase of Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) mutants have been reported to exert suicide gene effects in combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer. Here, we aimed to further evaluate the capacity of the mutanted enzyme and its potential for inhibiting cancer cell growth. METHODS: We altered the sequence of the last 10 amino acids of Dm-dNK to perform site-directed mutagenesis and constructed active site mutanted Dm-dNK (Dm-dNKmut), RT-PCR and western bloting studies were used to reveal the expression of lentivirus mediated Dm-dNKmut in a breast cancer cell line (Bcap37), a gastric cancer cell line (SGC7901) and a colorectal cancer cell line (CCL187). [3H]-labeled substrates were used for enzyme activity assays, cell cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assays, cell proliferation using a hemocytometer and apoptosis induction by thenannexin-V-FITC labeled FACS method. In vivo, an animal study was set out in which BALB/C nude mice bearing tumors were treated with lentivirus mediated expression of Dm-dNKmut with the pyrimidine nucleoside analog brivudine (BVDU, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-(2-deoxyuridine). RESULTS: The Dm-dNKmut could be stably expressed in the cancer cell lines and retained its enzymatic activity. Moreover, the cells expressing Dm-dNKmut exhibited increased sensitivity in combination with BVDU, with induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: These findings underlined the importance of BVDU phosphorylated by Dm-dNKmut in transduced cancer cells and the potential role of Dm-dNKmut as a suicide gene, thus providing the basis for future intensive research for cancer therapy.
