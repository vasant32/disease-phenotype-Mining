 BACKGROUND/AIMS: We analyzed colorectal resections in patients over 80 years old, performed for all benign and malign diseases. METHODOLOGY: We collected 300 consecutive colorectal resections between 2002 and 2008. Patients were divided into two groups: group A was composed by patients younger than 80 years old and group B by patients older than 80. Data were evaluated with t-test and chi-square test. RESULTS: We analyzed 180 women and 120 men. The median age was 66 years old (range, 30-90). Most frequent indications were colorectal cancer (46%), diverticulitis (35%) and extra-colic cancers (10%). Group B was composed of 60 patients (20%). Old patients had more concomitant diseases (62% vs. 33%, p<0.005), but complications, mortality and hospital stay were comparable in both groups. Surgical emergency increases morbidity (38% vs. 9%) and mortality (13.45 vs. 0.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal resections can be performed with good results in elderly patients. A colic disease must be detected before the patient develops a surgical complication because urgent surgery has more complications and deaths compared to elective surgery, especially for older patients.
