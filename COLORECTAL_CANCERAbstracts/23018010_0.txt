Colorectal cancer is one of the neoplasms most suitable for preventive measures, especially screening. Several cost-effective screening strategies are available: detection of fecal occult bleeding through chemical (guaiac tests) or immunological tests and endoscopic procedures such as flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This article reviews the most important studies on colorectal cancer screening presented at the annual congress of the American Gastroenterological Association, held in San Diego in May 2012, with special emphasis on its effectiveness in reducing the incidence and/or mortality associated with this neoplasm.
