 PURPOSE: To compare colonoscopy screening/surveillance rates by level of risk for colorectal cancer based on age, personal history of adenomatous polyps or colorectal cancer, or family history of colorectal cancer. METHODS: Participants were aged 30-90 years, were seen within 5 years at Intermountain Healthcare, and had family history in the Utah Population Database. Colonoscopy rates were measured for those with/without risk factors. RESULTS: Among those aged 60-69 years, 48.4% had colonoscopy in the last 10 years, with rates declining after age 70 years. Percentages of those having had a colonoscopy in the last 10 years generally increased by risk level from 38.5% in those with a familial relative risk <1.0 to 47.6% in those with a familial relative risk >3.0. Compared with those with no family history, the odds ratio for being screened according to guidelines was higher for those with one first-degree relative diagnosed with colorectal cancer ≥ 60 years or two affected second-degree relatives (1.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.46-1.61) than those with one affected first-degree relative diagnosed <60 years or ≥2 affected first-degree relatives (1.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.14-1.37). CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with colonoscopy guidelines was higher for those with familial risk but did not correspond with the degree of risk.
