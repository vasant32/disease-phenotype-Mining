While the most frequent, surgery for colorectal cancer is avoided in patients with metastases to the regional lymph nodes (stage III) or distant ones (stage IV). Hence, it is being increasingly substituted with neoadjuvant treatment. Our investigation is concerned with prospective evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity profile of capecitabine (XELODA) in combination with oxaliplatin (XELOX) and adjuvant Mayo treatment (stage IIb-III). Patients had undergone radical surgery (somatic status < or = 2-ECOG). The prospective group (166) received 8 courses of adjuvant polychemotherapy (XELOX); the retrospective (2001-2005) one (152)--6 (Mayo). The groups matched one another as far as number, gender, age and primary tumor localization are concerned. Regional lymph node involvement in group 1 was 64.5%; group 2--59.8%. Lympho-vascular invasion by tumor was typical of group 1; gastrointestinal toxicity - 9.2% (Mayo) vs. 7.2% in group 1. Hematological complications were 5.4% (XELOX) and 5.3% (Mayo); neutropenia-- 5.0% (Mayo) and 3.0% (XELOX); polyneutropenia-- 3.6% (XELOX); capecitabine-related Papillon-Lefevre syndrome-- 8.4%. Three-year relapse-free survival was 53.0% (XELOX) and 47.5 % (Mayo). After adjuvant treatment, toxicity profile with XELOX was lower than that after Mayo, with the survival tending to improve.
