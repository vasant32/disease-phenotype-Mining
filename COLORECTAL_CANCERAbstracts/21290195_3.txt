 BACKGROUND: Lymph node (LN) metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC) is a critical factor in making accurate prognoses and therapeutic decisions. This study evaluated the clinical performance of the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay in accurately diagnosing LN metastases in CRC patients through the specific detection of cytokeratin 19 mRNA levels in LNs. METHODS: The OSNA assay was performed on 121 LNs dissected from early-stage CRC patients (pStage 0 or I) or from patients with benign colorectal disease (study 1). Separately, 385 LNs were dissected from 85 CRC patients (any stage); the OSNA assay was performed on half of each LN, and the results were compared with histopathological examination in 2-mm intervals of the other LN half (study 2). RESULTS: In study 1, all 121 histopathologically negative LNs were also negative by the OSNA assay (concordance rate for metastasis negative: 1.0, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.976-1.0). In study 2, the concordance rate between the OSNA assay and the 2-mm-interval histopathological examination was 0.971 (95% CI: 0.950-0.984), with a sensitivity of 0.952 (95% CI: 0.881-0.987) and a specificity of 0.977 (95% CI: 0.953-0.991). CONCLUSIONS: The OSNA assay provided a judgment performance equivalent to a 2-mm-interval histopathological examination, a more detailed assay than the common pathological examination. Therefore, the OSNA assay is considered a new molecular examination method for the diagnosis of LN metastases in CRC patients in clinical settings.
