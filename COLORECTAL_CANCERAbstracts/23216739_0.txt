 UNLABELLED:  BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a role in cancer progression by degrading extracellular matrix and basement membranes, assisting in tumour neovascularization and in supporting immune response in cancer. METHODS: We studied the prognostic value of immunohistochemical expression of MMP-2, MMP-8, and MMP-9 in a series of 619 colorectal cancer patients using tissue microarray specimens. RESULTS: Of the samples, 56% were positive for MMP-2, 78% for MMP-8, and 60% for MMP-9. MMP-9 associated with low WHO grade (p < 0.001). In univariate analysis of Dukes' B tumours, MMP-9 negativity associated with poor survival (p = 0.018), and MMP-9 positivity was an independent prognostic marker in multivariate analysis of these tumours (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Negative MMP-9 expression can predict poor prognosis in Dukes' B colorectal tumours and may prove useful for identifying patients, who should be offered adjuvant treatment.
