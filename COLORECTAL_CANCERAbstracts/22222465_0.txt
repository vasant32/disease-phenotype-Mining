 PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan; it ranks top three in the cancer mortality rate. Curcuminoids are derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa. It has shown anti-cancer activity and apoptosis induction in a variety of cancer cell lines. This aims to study the potential of Poloxamer 407 as the thermogelling and mucoadhesive polymer for development of a site-targeting delivery system to enhance the localized delivery of curcuminoids to the colorectal cells for CRC chemotherapy. METHODS: The mucoadhesive strength and rheological properties were measured as a function of poloxamer loaded with curcuminoids. RESULTS: The gelation temperature of Poloxamer 407 was found to vary with its concentration and start gelling at 37Â°C at the concentration of 15.5% (w/v). To ensure gelation at physiological temperature after intra-rectal application, gelation temperature was determined by rheological measurement as well as by its physical appearance. The results indicated that its mucoadhesive strength also shows a dependency on temperature, which appears to be related to the increment in the maximum strength and average strength of the polymer. CONCLUSION: The results have suggested that Poloxamer 407 could be a potential thermogelling and mucoadhesive polymer for the development of a site-targeting colorectal drug delivery system for curcuminoids in colorectal cancer therapy.
