 AIM: St Mark's Bowel Cancer Screening Centre commenced screening in October 2006 as a contributor to the national programme. The first 35 months' experience is reported. METHOD: Individuals with a positive faecal occult blood test (FOBT) were offered colonoscopy or alternatives if they had significant comorbidity. All screening data were collected prospectively. RESULTS: Of the 98 815 FOBT kits issued, 42 523 were returned (43% uptake; 20.79% men). In total, 1339/1488 (90%) FOBT-positive participants attended the nurse clinic (57% men). Of these, 1057 had an index colonoscopy, 115 had a computed tomography colonoscopy (CTC) and eight had a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Five hundred and seventeen (44%) procedures were 'normal' (no polyps/cancers). Eighty (6%) individuals had colorectal cancer. The polyp detection rate in index procedures, including colonoscopy, CTC and flexible sigmoidoscopy, was 50%. The adenoma detection rate of all colonoscopies was 62.8%. The median polyp size was 5 (1-80) mm. In total, 1200 colonoscopies were performed by five accredited colonoscopists (96% completion rate). There were 13 (1%) adverse events with < 1 in 500 patients undergoing polypectomy requiring a transfusion. There was one 30-day postsurgical mortality, one perforation and no colonoscopy-related mortality. Almost all 39/40 (97%) patients in the BCS programme felt that the findings were adequately explained compared with 21/32 (64%) elective patients (P < 0.001) within the same unit. CONCLUSIONS: At this bowel cancer screening single centre, colonoscopy completion rates were high (unadjusted caecal intubation rate of 96%) and complication rates were low. In contrast to other published data, the uptake and cancer-detection rates were lower.
