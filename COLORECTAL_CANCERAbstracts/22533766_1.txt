Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was invented in Japan and is now permeating into the rest of the world. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the desirable ESD training by knowing the current status of ESD training in Japan. After this, we mainly discussed the following three topics: (i) requirements for preceptees to start ESD training; (ii) requirements for competent endoscopists in ESD; and (iii) requirements for preceptors in the first half of the upper gastrointestinal tract session at the Endoscopic Forum Japan 2011. Additionally, we discussed what Japanese endoscopists can do for further permeation of ESD outside Japan, especially in Asia in the second half. The session was wrapped up by the conclusions that it was absolutely necessary to establish official training courses authorized by the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society with certification for trainees and trainers and our Japanese endoscopists had a responsibility to spread ESD safely and reliably by collaborating with enthusiastic endoscopists in each country which have different backgrounds in terms of incidences and screening systems of target diseases, accessibility to endoscopy, medical economics, national characters, and so on.
