Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is a rare phenotypic variant of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC, Lynch syndrome), in which patients, in addition to visceral carcinomas, develop skin tumors. Multiple keratoacanthomas and basal cell carcinomas with sebocytic differentiation are characteristic as well as multiple benign and malignant tumors of the sebaceous glands, such as sebaceous adenoma, sebaceous epithelioma (sebaceoma) and sebaceous carcinoma. Particularly Cystic tumors of the sebaceous glands are especially suggestive of MTS. In genetically predisposed persons, cutaneous and visceral tumors are diagnosed at an average age of 53 years. Here we present an interesting case of a 65-year-old man in whom molecular genetic tests revealed a novel mutation in the MSH2 gene, leading to a frame shift within the gene.
