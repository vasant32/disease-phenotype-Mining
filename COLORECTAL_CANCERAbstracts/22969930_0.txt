microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs of endogenous origin. They have been increasingly shown to have aberrant expression in a number of tumor types. miR-192, -194 and -215 have not been comprehensively investigated using a large number of cases in colorectal cancer (CRC). We extracted total RNA from 107 CRC tissues and three CRC cell lines. Following polyadenylation and reverse transcription, the expression levels of miR-192, -194 and -215 were determined for evaluation of the association between expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) method. Finally, we studied the impact of miR-194 on cell proliferation in HCT-116 cells by MTT assay. miR-192, -194 and -215 were significantly downregulated in CRC tissues (all p<0.001, paired t-test) and cancer cell lines (all p<0.05) compared to non-tumor counterparts. Moreover, the expression levels of miR-192, -194 and -215 were demonstrated to be associated with increased tumor sizes (p=0.027, p=0.018, and p=0.027, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test). Also, there were marked correlations among these miRNAs in CRC tissues (all p<0.001, Pearson's regression analysis). Furthermore, we found that the overexpression of miR-194 could significantly inhibit cell proliferation in HTC-116 cells. miR-192, -194 and -215 may be important biological markers as tumor suppressors in the carcinogenesis of CRC.
