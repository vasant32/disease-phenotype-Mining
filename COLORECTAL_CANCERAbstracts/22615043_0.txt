Cancer of the colon does not always present with the familiar symptoms. Perforation and penetration of adjacent organs, with abscess formation as the initial presentation, is uncommon. Splenic abscess is a rare clinical entity. The four causes of a splenic abscess described are: primary pyogenic infection, splenic trauma, hemoglobinopathies and contiguous disease. In this paper we report a case of splenic abscess from colon cancer in an 50-year-old man who had a left lower chest contusion two-week before and review pertinent literature. Only 11 reported cases of splenic abscess from colorectal cancer were found in Medline.
