 PURPOSE: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibition by reducing tumoral interstitial fluid pressure might increase the efficacy of chemotherapy. Imatinib inhibits PDGFR kinase activity at therapeutically relevant doses. This phase I study aimed to assess the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of imatinib in combination with mFOLFOX6-bevacizumab in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and to identify pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions and toxicities. METHODS: Eligible patients had measurable disease and adequate organ function. On day-14, patients commenced imatinib daily plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg/2 weekly). Two weeks later (day 1), patients were also treated with full dose mFOLFOX6-bevacizumab for 12 cycles. Blood samples were taken for PK. DLTs defined in the first 6 weeks. Standard dose escalation of imatinib, with 3 patient cohorts: planned dose levels (DL): DL1; 400 mg, DL2; 600 mg, DL3; 800 mg daily. RESULTS: Ten patients enrolled. DL1 3 patients, DL2 7 patients. DLTs observed in 3 of 6 patients in DL2: febrile neutropenia (2); Grade 3 infection and Grade 4 neutropenia (1). Neutropenia was most frequent AEs: Grade 3/4 in >60 % of patients overall. In DL2 pts, imatinib clearance was reduced post-chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Oxaliplatin and 5FU PK unchanged by imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: MTD was imatinib 400 mg plus full dose mFOLFOX-bevacizumab. Dose escalation of imatinib limited by neutropenia. Further study is warranted as imatinib can be delivered at levels that inhibit PDGFR.
