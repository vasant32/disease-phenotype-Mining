Constitutional epimutation is one of the causes for MLH1 gene inactivation associated with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome. Here we investigate MLH1 promoter hypermethylation in 110 sporadic early-onset colorectal cancer patients. Variable levels of hypermethylation were detected in 55 patients (50%). Importantly a reduced MLH1 gene expression was found in patients with high-level methylation, with the association of microsatellite instability (MSI) in their tumor cells. Such high-level methylation accounts for 7.4% of all patients included in this study. Furthermore, we found that in one case constitutional methylation affected both alleles, indicating a post-zygotic methylation dysregulation. Our findings suggest that constitutional epimutation is a mechanism underlying early-onset colorectal cancer, although it is involved in only a small proportion of patients, who require appropriate surveillance. Our findings provide further insight into the role of aberrant constitutional methylation in colon carcinogenesis and raise the question of whether prevalent low-level methylation constitutes a potential risk factor for cancer development.
