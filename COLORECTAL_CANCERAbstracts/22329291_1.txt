Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignant tumour in males and the fourth most common malignancy in women in the Republic of Croatia. It is usually manifested as stool forming disorders, feeling that bowel does not empty completely, finding blood in the stool, weight loss and fatigue. In-time diagnosis, confirmed by pathohistological findings, is cornerstone of successful treatment. The decision about treatment is made based on clinical assessment of disease stage and other risk factors, after completion of the diagnostic process. Depending on that, treatment options include surgery, the application of systemic therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy) and radiotherapy. The following text presents the clinical guidelines in order to standardize procedures and criteria for the diagnosis, management, treatment and monitoring of patients with colorectal cancer in the Republic of Croatia.
