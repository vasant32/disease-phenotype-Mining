Patient prognosis in colorectal cancer is determined as in most solid cancers by the extent of local invasion and the presence of lymph node and distant metastases. The invasive potential of a tumor depends on the ability to degrade extracellular matrix proteins, for example, by matrix metalloproteinases. An important inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases is reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK), a membrane-anchored glycoprotein. This study investigated the prognostic relevance of RECK expression in colorectal cancer in a cohort of 283 patients. Analysis of immunohistochemical tissue microarray data showed that RECK protein levels did not seem to correlate with clinicopathologic parameters (Spearman rank correlation coefficients between -0.14 and -0.18) and that decreased RECK expression was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival, with a mean survival of 70 months in RECK-negative (146 cases) versus 97 months in RECK-positive patients (137 cases) (log-rank test, P = .002).
