 PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of two tablet formulations containing 500 mg of capecitabine (CAS number 154361-50-9) in patients with colon, colorectal or breast cancer. METHODS: The study was a multicentric, open label, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose, crossover bioequivalence study in patients of either sex with colon, colorectal or breast cancer. Eligible patients received each treatment in a crossover manner under fed conditions according to the randomization schedule. The pre-dose blood sample was taken within 90 min prior to dosing, and serial blood sampling was done up to 10.00 h post-dose under monochromatic light. The analysis of plasma samples for concentrations of capecitabine and 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) was carried out using a validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. Bioequivalence was to be concluded if the confidence intervals so constructed were within the range of 80-125 % for C(max), AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞) of capecitabine and 5'-DFCR. Patients were monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. RESULTS: The 90 % confidence intervals for the "test/reference" mean ratios of the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic variables C(max), AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-∞) were clearly within the conventional bioequivalence range of 80-125 %. Both the formulations were reasonably tolerated after a single oral dose in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Both the capecitabine tablet formulations demonstrated equivalent rate and extent of systemic absorption, and hence were considered bioequivalent. Therefore, the two formulations can be considered as equivalent in terms of pharmacokinetics and safety profiles.
