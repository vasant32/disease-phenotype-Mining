Colorectal cancer is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in Western countries, the second cause of cancer mortality in the USA and a major public health problem in Mexico. A diet rich in legumes is directly related to the prevention of colon cancer, showing an inverse relationship with the development of colorectal adenomas in human subjects. The present study shows the results of molecular changes involved in the Tp53 pathway at an early stage in the distal colon tissue of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon cancer in rats evaluated by PCR array after exposure to diets containing the non-digestible fraction (NDF) of cooked bean (cultivar Bayo Madero). Significant differences were detected in seventy-two genes of the Tp53-mediated signalling pathway involved in apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation and arrest, inhibition of proliferation and inflammation, and DNA repair. Tp53, Gadd45a, Cdkn1a and Bax were highly expressed (9·3-, 18·3-, 5·5- and 3·5-fold, respectively) in the NDF+AOM group, whereas Cdc25c, Ccne2, E2f1 and Bcl2 were significantly suppressed ( - 9·2-, - 2·6-, - 18·4- and - 3·5-fold, respectively), among other genes, compared with the AOM group, suggesting that chemoprevention of aberrant crypt foci results from a combination of cell-cycle arrest in G1/S and G2/M phases and cell death by apoptotic induction. We demonstrate that the NDF from common bean modulates gene expression profiles in the colon tissue of AOM-induced rats, contributing to the chemoprotective effect of common bean on early-stage colon cancer.
