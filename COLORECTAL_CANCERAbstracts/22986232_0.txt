In the search for new strategies to efficiently fight colorectal cancer, efforts are being increasingly focused on targeting regulatory signaling pathways involved in cancer-specific features. As a result, several studies have recently addressed the therapeutic potential of molecularly-targeted drugs capable of inhibiting the activity of protein kinases involved in relevant signaling cascades. Here we show that simultaneous inhibition of the DFG-in and DFG-out conformations of p38Î± by means of type-I and type-II inhibitors is beneficial to impair more efficiently its kinase activity. Moreover, we found that SB202190 (type-I) and sorafenib (type-II) synergize at the molecular and biological level, as co-treatment with these compounds enhances tumor growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis both in colorectal cancer cell lines and animal models. These results support the need to reconsider sorafenib as a therapeutic agent against colorectal cancer and provide new insights that underline the importance to elucidate the activity of protein kinase inhibitors for the treatment of colorectal carcinoma.
