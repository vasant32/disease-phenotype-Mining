 UNLABELLED: Epidemiological studies prove that incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing. The first line therapy of colorectal cancer is surgical resection of the primary tumor and elimination of regional and remote metastases. THE AIM OF THE STUDY was to determine expression of adhesion molecules CD134 and CD137 in the peripheral blood in colorectal cancer patients, depending on clinical cancer stage, size and invasion of the tumor. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study enrolled 72 patients with primary colorectal adenocarcinoma. An average patient age was 64.55 years. Clinical tumor stage was assessed using two scales: Dukes: A and Astler-Coller scale. Expression of adhesion molecules was determined in the peripheral blood collected on the day of the procedure and 10 days after the procedure. RESULTS: An average activity of CD134 molecules (12.66%) was significantly higher than that of CD137 (6.26%) (p<0.001). Clinical tumor stage was assessed on Dukes scale and was unrelated to CD134 activity, while activity of CD137 was related to clinical cancer stage. CONCLUSIONS: CD137 activity is directly proportional to colorectal cancer stage. Surgical resection of the tumor results in increased CD134 and CD137 expression. Long term studies, enrolling larger groups of patients, including their subdivision to colon and rectal cancer, are required to utilize CD134 and CD137 in immune therapy of colorectal cancer.
