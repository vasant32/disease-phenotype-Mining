Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was first applied in the resection of large colorectal tumors 10 years ago. Frequent complications and technical difficulties were serious problems at first, but were gradually improved with experience. Here, we describe the indications, technical aspects and management of complications of ESD for colorectal tumors. In 2009, we introduce the use of small tip insulation-tipped diathermic (IT) knife. Features separating it from the IT knife and IT Knife2 are a smaller ceramic tip and small round disk at the root of the tip. During submucosal dissection, the small tip IT knife could dissect large pieces of tissue intact. This allows us to shorten the procedure time, particularly the submucosal dissection component. A total of 146 ESD for 140 patients were performed between January 2009 and July 2011. En bloc, and en bloc and R0 resection rates were 92.5% and 83.6%, respectively. Median procedural time was 48.5 min for 40.5 mm specimens. Perforation and delayed bleeding occurred in 2.1% and 1.4%, respectively. We successfully performed ESD for colorectal tumors with a shortened procedure time while preserving quality and safety.
