Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC) is exceedingly rare in the pediatric population (fewer than 2 cases per 1 million children). There are 2 major categories of pediatric colorectal adenocarcinoma syndromes: polyposis-related and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, also known as Lynch syndrome. Germ line mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (eg, MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6) have been established as the molecular genetic basis of Lynch syndrome. Another prognostic factor in adult CRAC is the reduced expression of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), which has been associated with poor outcome in some adult CRAC cases; however, its role in predicting prognoses in pediatric cases remains unclear. Seven pediatric patients with primary CRAC were reviewed. Available molecular genetic test results were evaluated, and immunohistochemical labeling for MMR proteins and E-cadherin were performed on 5 patients. Four of the 5 patients in our study with available paraffin blocks showed loss of MMR protein expression, consistent with Lynch syndrome. In cases stained for E-cadherin, 3 were strongly positive and 2 were weakly positive; however, with the small sample size and the relatively short follow-up period, an accurate correlation between E-cadherin and prognosis cannot be reached with any degree of certainty. Our findings highlight the importance of genetic testing for MMR gene mutations in children with colorectal cancer and suggest further investigation into the prognostic role of E-cadherin in pediatric CRAC.
