 INTRODUCTION: In Mexico during 2008, were reported 127,604 new cancer cases, 6,347 of them were colorectal cancer cases and 4,276 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate health related quality of life in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and colorectal cancer cases in different clinical stages, attended in a High Specialty Medical facility at the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, during a 13 month period. RESULTS: 162 patients were included, 56.8% (n=92) with NHL and 43.2% (n=70) with colorectal cancer. The scores obtained in the NHL group were: Global health status/QoL: 67.75 (± 27.55), physical functioning 69.64 (± 29.98), role functioning 71.38 (± 33.73), emotional functioning 69.7 (± 26.57), cognitive functioning 75.36 (± 28.01), social functioning 79.35 (± 29.38), fatigue 35.27 (± 28.27), nausea and vomiting 13.41 (± 21.85), pain 28.08 (± 30.25), dyspnea 19.20 (± 32.11), insomnia 30.80 (± 38.03), appetite lost 26.45 (± 36.16), constipation 19.20 (± 32.11), diarrhea 12.32 (± 26.48), financial difficulties 26.09 (± 35.57). In colorectal cancer patients the scores were: Global health status/QoL: 68.21 (± 24.46), physical functioning 67.38 (± 30.45), role functioning 65.48 (± 35.70), emotional functioning 66.43 (± 26.84), cognitive functioning 78.57 (± 26.49), social functioning 75.24 (± 31.05), fatigue 37.78 (± 31.62), nausea and vomiting 20.00 (± 28.32), pain 37.38 (± 34.45), dyspnea 11.90 (± 26.64), insomnia 28.09 (± 35.73), appetite lost 23.81 (± 36.40), constipation 19.05 (± 32.88), diarrhea 20.95 (± 31.17), financial difficulties 34.76 (± 38.67). CONCLUSIONS: With these basal results is important a follow-up with special attention to the treatment and attendance processes, in patients with this neoplasms and their impact on the quality of life.
