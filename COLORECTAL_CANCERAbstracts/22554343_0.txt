 BACKGROUND: In Japan, a study comparing the effectiveness and safety of irinotecan plus S-1 (IRIS) with those of a combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as second-line treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer demonstrated that IRIS was non-inferior to FOLFIRI. We previously reported that IRIS is also effective as first-line treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria included inoperable recurrent colorectal cancer with a confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, age â‰¥20 years, and no history of prior chemotherapy. S-1 (40-60 mg twice daily) was given orally on Days 1 to 14, and irinotecan (100 mg/m(2)) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) were given intravenously on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was safety. The secondary endpoints included overall response (OR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 52 eligible patients were enrolled from October 2007 through March 2009. In safety analysis, the incidences of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were as follows: neutropenia, 27%; hypertension, 21%; and diarrhea, 17%. The overall response rate was 57.7%. Median progression-free survival was 16.7 months. CONCLUSION: IRIS plus bevacizumab is a well-tolerated, highly effective chemotherapeutic regimen that is easy to administer.
