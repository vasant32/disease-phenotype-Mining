Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) acts as a netrin-1 receptor and mediates attractive response of axons to netrin-1 in neural development. However, the signaling mechanisms of netrin-DSCAM remain unclear. Here we report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) interacts with DSCAM through its Î³ subunit, but does not interact with DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), another major receptor for netrin-1. Netrin-treatment of cultured cortical neurons leads to increased phosphorylation of AMPK. Both AMPK mutant with dominant-negative effect and AMPK inhibitor can significantly suppress netrin-1 induced neurite outgrowth. Together, these findings demonstrate that AMPK interacts with DSCAM and plays an important role in netrin-1 induced neurite outgrowth. Our study uncovers a previously unknown component, AMPK, in netrin-DSCAM signaling pathway.
