In a previous report, we demonstrated the efficacy of an intervention to promote colorectal cancer screening among African Americans in a controlled community intervention trial. Participants in the intervention, named EPICS (Educational Program to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening), were twice as likely to be screened after six months as those in the control group. In the current project, we put the intervention into practice through an academic-health department partnership, and the intervention performed as well as it had in the controlled trial. This success may be due to the community-based participatory methods used in designing and testing the intervention.
