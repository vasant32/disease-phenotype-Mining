Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies. Therapeutic options depend on location of the primitive tumor, its expandability, its hormonal symptoms and its differentiation. Though relatively rare, with an increasing incidence and a high prevalence digestive neuroendocrine tumors (DNETs) are ranked just behind colorectal cancer as the most common digestive cancers in developed countries. Three main therapeutic axes have been individualized in the field of well-differentiated DNETs (corresponding to grades 1 and 2 of new WHO classification 2010), firstly, antitumor activity of somatostatin analogs, particularly in slowly progressive metastatic DNETs with limited hepatic invasion, secondly, targeting angiogenesis in these hypervascular tumors and thirdly targeting the mTOR pathway involved in DNETs carcinogenesis. As a consequence of two major randomized phase III trials in 2011, sunitinib and everolimus have been considered as new therapeutic options for well-differentiated, advanced and progressive pancreatic NETs. For everolimus, another phase III study, although non-significant with the chosen criteria, showed effectiveness notably against small intestine NETs. These targeted therapies are new therapeutic weapons in management of well-differentiated DNETs, but its exact role in care strategy, in comparison with other treatments (somatostatin analogs, chemo-embolization, chemotherapyâ€¦) deserves to be precise in the future.
