 AIM: To clarify the correlation between morphological features and the mRNA expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 29 colorectal tumors, cancer cells were isolated by laser microdissection, and the mRNA expression of metalloproteinases was compared between the tumor center and the invasive front. RESULTS: Regarding the central region as the standard, the mRNA levels of ADAM-12, MMP-1, -2, -7, and -9 at the invasive front were up-regulated. The degree of up-regulation was significantly higher in solid cancer nest (SCN)-positive tumors than in SCN-negative tumors for the mRNA levels of ADAM-12, MMP-2, -7, and - 9 (SCN-positive, median 5.1-, 3.9-, 9.9-, and 2.7-fold; SCN-negative 2.0-, 1.0-, 2.4-, and 0.8-fold; p<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Up-regulation of the mRNA expression of particular metalloproteinases was significantly associated with the SCN at the leading edge of colorectal tumors.
