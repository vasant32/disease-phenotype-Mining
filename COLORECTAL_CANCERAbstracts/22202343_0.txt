We report three cases of patients in their eighties who received anti-EGFR antibody mono-therapy as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. CASE 1: An 86-year-old woman who received cetuximab after a colostomy for unresectable rectal cancer with synchronous liver and lung metastases. Serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 showed a significant decrease at 2 months, after which they showed a gradual increase. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a reduction in the rectal tumor. CASE 2: An 82-year-old woman who received cetuximab for peritoneal metastases after a transverse colectomy. Serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 decreased to normal levels at 2 months, and CT imaging revealed disappearance of the tumor in the peritoneal cavity. CASE 3: A 79-year-old man who received panitumumab for lung, liver and para-aortic lymph node metastases after a descending colectomy. Serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 showed a decrease at 1 month, after which they showed a gradual increase. No marked change in the tumor was observed by CT. No change was observed in performance status or Vulnerable Elders Survey( VES-13) score, and the effect on overall condition was minimal. Grade 1-2 acneiform skin rash, paronychia, and desquamation, and grade 2-3 dry skin and pruritis were observed. More precise instructions on measures for dealing with skin rash are necessary to obtain higher drug compliance.
