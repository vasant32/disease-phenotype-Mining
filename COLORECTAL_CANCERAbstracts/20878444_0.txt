 BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a common toxicity of anti-VEGF agents, but its optimal treatment remains to define. This study aimed to describe the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, in patients with metastatic malignancies treated with bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to VEGF. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty-seven patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, colorectal or ovarian cancer receiving bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks) and chemotherapy were eligible for this analysis. Blood pressure was measured at home twice daily according to international guidelines. Patients received amlodipine 5 mg daily for grade â‰¥ 2 bevacizumab-induced hypertension. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients received amlodipine 5 mg daily for de novo hypertension (group A), and another 10 patients received amlodipine for exacerbation of previously existing hypertension (group B). Hypertension was controlled within 7 days under amlodipine in 23/26 (88.5%, 95%CI: 76.2-100) patients in group A, and 8/10 (80%, 95%CI: 55.2-100) patients in group B, with a favourable toxicity profile. CONCLUSIONS: Amlodipine 5 mg daily appears safe and efficient for the treatment of hypertension in patients receiving bevacizumab at a dose-intensity of 2.5 mg/kg/week. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these results.
