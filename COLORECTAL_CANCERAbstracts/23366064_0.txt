Intraoperative histopathological investigation plays an important role during surgery. Since the pathologist performs a diagnosis with a limited level of specimen, it may sometimes be difficult to reach a correct diagnosis. To improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, quantitative data from the whole specimen are helpful. It said that the detection capability for DNA aneuploidy (aneuploidy) is low for solid cancer compared with hematopoietic organ cancer. A new method that includes fresh tissue is introduced, the histogram from cancer tissue (cancer) and normal tissue (normal) is compared, new classification criteria are introduced, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) pattern (FFT pattern) obtained from FFT on the histogram is analyzed, and the area under the FFT pattern of the histogram (AUC) is compared. This method, named the "FFT-AUC method", which includes comparisons of AUC and the FFT pattern, shows good results.
