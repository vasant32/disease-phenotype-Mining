According to current scientific investigations radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a local ablative tumor therapy for unresectable liver malignancies is currently accepted as the best therapeutic choice. The results of randomized trials justify RFA for small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and RFA is considered to be a viable alternative to resection for inoperable patients with limited hepatic metastatic disease, especially from colorectal cancer (CRC LM). However, surgical resection still remains the gold standard for resectable CRC LM. The intraprocedural image guidance modality of choice is computed tomography (CT) alongside CT fluoroscopy. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for preprocedural lesion detection and differentiation as well as for follow-up and can be used to perform RFA procedures as well. This article highlights new developments in RFA.
