The aim of the present study was to investigate the chromosomal aberrations that are linked with the crucial clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its prognosis by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Fresh-frozen tumor tissues of 94 cases of CRC were analyzed by using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) CGH slides spotted with 4030 human BAC clones, which covered the whole range of the human genome at an average interval of 0.83 mega base pairs. DNA copy number aberrations (DCNAs) were identified in association with clinicopathological features: a gain of 8q24.3 and losses of 9q33.1 and 20p12.2 were associated with lymph node metastasis, gain of 8q24.3 and loss of 9q33.1 with disease stage, gain of 8q21.11 and loss of 10q21.3 with lymphovascular invasion and losses of 3p25.1, 10p15.3, 12q15 and 17p13.1 for venous invasion. These aberrations can be regarded as genomic biomarkers to predict the clinical outcome of patients with CRC, and are expected to serve to individualize the treatment of CRC patients.
