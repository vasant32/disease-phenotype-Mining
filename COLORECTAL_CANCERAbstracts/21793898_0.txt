Introduction of new agents for the treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) has been accompanied by the publication of guidelines. The COLCHIC cohort was set up to evaluate CRC treatment practices and the use of these innovative and expensive agents. Patients initiating CRC treatment at the Bordeaux teaching hospital between 1 March 2005 and 1 March 2006 were identified, and treatment courses from 1 March 2005 to 31 December 2006 were studied; 192 patients were included, 188 with analysable data: 43 patients initiated 51 courses for non-metastatic cancer, 153 initiated 366 courses for metastatic cancer, eight patients initiated courses for both non-metastatic and metastatic cancer. Most treatments were used for indications found in guidelines published during the study (83.9%). Of the others, nearly half were approved in guidelines published subsequently. In this teaching hospital, prescribing practice was generally in line with recommendations, with an anticipation of future guidelines. This mostly concerned monoclonal antibodies, which were new at the time of the study.
