Analysis of blood and lymphatic vessel in colorectal cancer is controversial in the literature, possibly due to variations in the methods of analysis. In this study, it was aimed to search for a reliable approach in the quantification of angio- and lymphangiovascular density and area as a prognostic factor and to compare such vessel counts in normal mucosa, adenomas and cancer. A retrospective study was performed on 60 sporadic colorectal cancer, 30 colorectal adenomas, and 10 colorectal non-neoplastic lesions. Archival tissues were submitted to immunohistochemical evaluation using antibodies to CD31, CD34, CD105, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and D2-40. Microvessel density and total vascular area were determined by computer image analysis and values were compared in the three groups of lesions; the prognostic value of these parameters was evaluated in the group of colorectal cancer. Most markers showed progressive vessel counts from non-neoplastic tissue to carcinoma, both for microvessel density and total vascular area. Only microvessel density determined by CD34 in the central areas of the cancer correlated with recurrence/metastasis (p = 0.04) and survival (p = 0.02). Different methods of quantification (microvessel counting versus estimation of total vascular area), immunohistochemical markers (pan-endothelial marker versus neovessels and lymphatic markers), and areas of analysis (periphery versus inner portions of the lesion) were assessed using image analysis. The results corroborate the increase in vascularization of carcinoma and suggest that microvessel density determined by immunostaining for CD34 in the inner portion of the tumor might represent a prognostically relevant parameter in colorectal cancer.
