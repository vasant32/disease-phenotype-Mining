 OBJECTIVES: Minimal preparation CT of the colon (MPCT colon) is used for investigation of suspected colorectal cancer in frail and/or elderly patients who would be expected to tolerate laxative bowel preparation poorly. Although it has good sensitivity for colorectal cancer it has a poor specificity. We wished to investigate whether distension of the colon with carbon dioxide alone would reduce the number of false-positives, but without making the test arduous or excessively uncomfortable. METHODS: 134 patients were recruited and underwent MPCT colon with gas insufflation and antispasmodics. Results were compared with a cohort of 134 patients undergoing standard protocol MPCT colon. The numbers of false-positives were compared, as was reader confidence. All trial patients were given a questionnaire documenting their experience. RESULTS: The number of false-positives was 15% in the control group and 5% in the trial group; this difference was statistically significant, (p=0.01). Reader confidence was increased in the trial group. Patient tolerance was good, with 95% saying they would have the test again. CONCLUSION: Use of gas insufflation and antispasmodics reduces the false-positives from 15% to 5% without adversely affecting patient tolerance.
