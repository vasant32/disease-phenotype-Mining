BACKGROUND: There are still concerns about the oncologic safety of stent insertion for colorectal cancer obstruction. This study investigated whether the use of stents as a bridge to surgery negatively affect the long-term outcome compared to curative surgery for left-sided colorectal cancer obstruction. METHODS: Between January 2004 and December 2009, patients with left-sided colorectal cancer obstruction without distant metastasis were retrospectively reviewed. Forty-three patients underwent radical resection after preoperative stent insertion (stent group), whereas 48 underwent emergency surgery with curative intent (surgery group). The short- and long-term outcomes between the two groups were compared. RESULTS: The stent and surgery groups had similar demographics. There were no significant differences in primary anastomosis, laparoscopic-assisted surgery, operation time, time until first defecation and oral intake after surgery, postoperative hospital stay, and reoperation. The stent group had an average hospital stay 7 days longer than the surgery group. During the median follow-up period of 48.1 months, the 5-year disease-free survival rates were not significantly different between the stent and surgery groups (47.2 vs. 48.9 %, respectively; p = 0.499). Overall, the 5-year survival rate was also similar in the two groups (70.4 vs. 76.4 %, respectively; p = 0.941). CONCLUSIONS: For left-sided colorectal cancer obstruction, stent insertion followed by surgery showed short-term advantages and similar oncologic outcomes compared to surgery without preoperative intervention. Stent insertion as a bridge to surgery is a safe and feasible treatment option for patients with colorectal cancer obstruction.
