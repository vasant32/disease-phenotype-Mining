It is common to use systemic chemotherapy, instead of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or other cytotoxic agents, for unresectable hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients. Nevertheless, systemic administration of anticancer agents such as FOLFOX or FOLFIRI is sometimes difficult to continue for infirm patients. A 71-year-old female who had undergone sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer received HAI for 12 months because of big bilobar hepatic metastases and poor performance status. Thereafter, a two-stage hepatectomy(first, left lobe: second, S7+8 and S5) was performed successfully. She has been alive for 2.5 years after the first operation but with two small lung metastases in the left lobe. Because of bad performance status and her weak social and familial conditions, treatment with standard systemic chemotherapy could not be continued. In such cases, HAI should be performed if the metastases are limited to the liver.
