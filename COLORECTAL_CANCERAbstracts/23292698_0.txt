PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to explore the participation in physical activity (PA) by colorectal cancer survivors across cancer trajectories and based on selected demographic and medical variables. METHODS: A total of 431 participants were surveyed individually at the Shinchon Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea, to determine their PA levels before diagnosis, during treatment and after completion of cancer treatment. RESULTS: Percentage of survivors meeting American College of Sports Medicine guideline significantly reduced from 27 % before diagnosis to 10 % during treatment due to reduced strenuous intensity PA (28.8 ± 106.2 vs 11.8 ± 95.9 min, p = 0.042), while total PA and mild intensity PA did not change. Total (187.2 ± 257.7 vs. 282.6 ± 282.0 min, p < 0.001) and mild (99.1 ± 191.5 vs. 175.1 ± 231.2 min, p < 0.001) intensity PA significantly increased after the completion of treatments compared with their PA level before diagnosis. Further analyses showed that age (more vs. equal or less than 60 years) and chemotherapy (chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy) significantly influenced the level of physical activity (p = 0.004). Survivors who were older or received chemotherapy increased their total PA and mild intensity PA after the completion of treatment more than those who did not receive chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The level and the pattern of physical activity by colorectal cancer survivors differed across cancer trajectories, which were significantly influenced by age and adjuvant chemotherapy.
