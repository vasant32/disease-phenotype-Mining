In this manuscript, we describe a shotgun proteomics approach for a comprehensive proteomic analysis of samples including total lysates, membrane, secretome, and exosome fractions from a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines. We will present an analysis of our proteomics data in two alternative formats. First we will discuss a traditional analysis of our data, in which we identify a number of cancer-associated proteins using various proteomic data analysis tools. In a second approach, we use a chromosome format to organize the proteomic data on chromosome 7, allowing the identification of clusters of cancer-associated genes with boundaries defined by physical proximity on different chromosomes.
