BackgroundCD163 is a 130-kDa transmembrane protein expressed in human monocytes and macrophages, and the aberrant expression of CD163 in breast and colorectal cancer associated with patients' poor prognosis was reported. Here, we analyzed the expression of CD163 in meningioma, a common intracranial tumor, and its molecular mechanism in association with meningioma progression.MethodsFirst, we performed immunohistochemical analysis using 50 human meningioma specimens. Next, we established CD163-overexpressing human meningioma cell lines and investigated its roles in tumor progression in vitro and in vivo.ResultsImmunohistochemically, 26 of 50 human meningioma specimens (52.0%) were positive for CD163 in tumor cells, including benign grade I (48.5%) and grade II (71.4%) cases. Furthermore, CD163 expression was correlated with histological atypical parameters that directly predict the prognosis of meningioma. CD163-overexpressing meningioma cells showed significant suppression of apoptosis and accelerated tumor growth in nude mice. In addition, unexpected splenomegaly affiliated with the xenograft predicted tumor-derived granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, which was confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates CD163 expression in meningioma not only by immunohistochemistry but also by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, using primary culture cells, and provides the novel molecular function of CD163 to prevent apoptosis through the production of G-CSF in meningioma.
