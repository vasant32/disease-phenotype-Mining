 BACKGROUND: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advocates use of a 5A's framework (assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange) for preventive health recommendations. PURPOSE: To describe 5A content of patient-physician colorectal cancer (CRC) screening discussions and physician-recommended screening modality and to test if these vary by whether patient previously received screening recommendation. METHODS: Direct observation of periodic health examinations in 2007-2009 among average-risk primary care patients aged 50-80 years due for screening. Qualitative content analyses conducted 2008-2010 used to code office visit audio-recordings for 5A and other discussion content. RESULTS: Among study-eligible visits (N=415), 59% contained assistance (i.e., help scheduling colonoscopy or delivery of stool cards), but the assess, advise, and agree steps were rarely comprehensively provided (1%-21%), and only 3% included the last step, arrange follow-up. Almost all physicians endorsed screening via colonoscopy (99%), either alone (69%) or in combination with other tests (30%). Patients nonadherent to a prior physician screening recommendation (31%) were less likely to have the reason(s) for screening discussed (37% vs 65%) or be told the endoscopy clinic would call them for scheduling (19% vs 27%), and more likely to have fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) alone (34% vs 25%) or FOBT and colonoscopy recommended (24% vs 14%), and a screening plan negotiated (21% vs 14%). Significance level is p<0.05 for all contrasts. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients due for CRC screening discuss screening with their physician, but with limited application of the 5A's approach. Opportunities to improve CRC screening decision-making are great, particularly among patients who are nonadherent to a prior recommendation from a physician.
