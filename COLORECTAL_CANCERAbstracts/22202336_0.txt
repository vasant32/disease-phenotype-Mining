The aim of this study was to determine whether mRNA levels of thymidylate synthase (TS), excision repair cross-complementing -1 (ERCC-1), excision repair cross-complementing-2 (ERCC-2) and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase( MTHFD) mRNA in the primary tumor could predict a tumor response in patients with unresectable liver metastasis from colorectal cancer treated with mFOLFOX6 therapy as a first-line treatment. Eighteen patients with unresectable liver metastasis from colorectal cancer treated with mFOLFOX6 therapy as a first-line treatment were enrolled in this study. There were no significant differences between the response rate and these enzymes mRNA levels. In ERCC-1 and MTHFD mRNA expression, the progression-free survival time tended to be longer in patients with low levels than in patients with high levels( ERCC-1: p=0.08, MTHFD: p=0.07). The progression-free survival time was significantly longer in patients with both ERCC-1 and MTHFD mRNA were low levels than in patients with other( p=0.03). The levels of ERCC-1 and MTHFD were low in patients who could perform a conversion therapy. There were no significant differences between an overall survival time and these enzymes mRNA levels. In this study, the ERCC-1 and MTHFD mRNA expression may be useful for the prediction of progression-free survival time in patients with unresectable liver metastasis from colorectal cancer treated with mFOLFOX6 therapy.
