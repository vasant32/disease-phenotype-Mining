 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of neural salient serine/arginine-rich protein 1 (NSSR1) in colorectal cancer. METHODS: RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemical staining were used to detect the expression of NSSR1 mRNA and protein in different mouse tissues and human colorectal cancer, respectively. RESULTS: NSSR1 mRNA was expressed in mouse cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, liver, intestine, kidney and lung tissue, but NSSR1 protein was only expressed in neural tissues. In normal human intestinal mucosa, NSSR1 was expressed in the colorectal epithelial cells. In colorectal cancer, NSSR1 was highly expressed in the nucleus of tumor cells. CONCLUSION: The extensive expression of NSSR1 in colorectal cancer cells may hint it's roles in the biological function of colorectal cancer.
