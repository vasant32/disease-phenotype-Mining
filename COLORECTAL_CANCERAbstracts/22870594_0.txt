CD133, a marker which has been advocated to mark colorectal carcinoma "stem or tumour initiating cells" is amongst the frequently studied markers in colorectal cancer. A study was conducted at the Department of Pathology, University of Malaya Medical Centre to determine the expression of CD133 in 56 archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded colorectal adenocarcinoma in comparison with adjacent benign colorectal epithelium by immunohistochemical staining for CD133 expression. CD133 immunopositivity was determined as staining at the glandular luminal surface or in the intraluminal debris. Expression was semiquantitated for (1) proportion of CD133 immunopositivity in the malignant or adjacent benign colorectal epithelium and (2) intensity of staining. The final score of CD133 immunopositivity was arbitrarily taken as proportion of CD133 immunopositivity multiplied by intensity of staining in both the malignant and adjacent benign colorectal epithelium. CD133 expression was observed in significantly increased frequency in 49 (87.5%) colorectal adenocarcinoma compared with 15 (26.8%) of the adjacent benign colorectal epithelium (p<0.05). In terms of immunopositivity score (proportion of CD133 immunopositivity multiplied by intensity of staining), colorectal adenocarcinoma had a mean arbitrary score of 8.5 which was significantly higher than the mean immunopositivity score of 0.5 of the adjacent benign colorectal epithelium (p<0.05). In addition, the maximum immunopositivity score for the adjacent benign colorectal epithelium was 4, while 38 (67.9%) of colorectal adenocarcinoma had scores >4. This study shows that CD133 is able to mark colorectal adenocarcinoma but it is still unclear at this juncture whether CD133 is indeed a marker for colorectal adenocarcinoma "stem cells".
