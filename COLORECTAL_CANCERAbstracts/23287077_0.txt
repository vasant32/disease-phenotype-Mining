Multiple intracellular signaling pathways, such as Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, epidermal growth factor receptor/Ras signaling, and p53 signaling are frequently dysregulated in colorectal cancer. Recent evidence also points to the involvement of signaling pathways in the developmental process, including Notch signaling, Hedgehog signaling, and Hippo signaling. Dysregulation of these signaling pathways contribute to the acquisition of malignant phenotypes, including unchecked cell cycle progression, evasion of apoptosis, induction of genetic instability, and enhanced invasiveness and metastasis. Understanding their relative importance and crosstalk will provide a rational basis for anticancer drug development.
