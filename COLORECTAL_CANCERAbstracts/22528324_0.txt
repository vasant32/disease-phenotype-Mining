 BACKGROUND: Many properties of cancer cells are reminiscent of those in normal stem cells. Genes important to stem cell development have been significantly implicated in the etiology and clinical outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the associations of genetic variations in these genes with CRC prognosis have not yet been elucidated. METHODS: We analyzed the effects of eight potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six stem cell-related genes on the prognosis of a well-characterized population of 380 Chinese CRC patients diagnosed from February 2006 to January 2010. RESULTS: The most significant finding was related to rs879882, a variant in the 5' region of POU5F1 gene which encodes a protein essential for embryonic stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency, and induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming. The variant-containing genotypes of rs879882 were associated with an increased risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-3.76, P = 0.01). In chemotherapy-stratified analysis, the association remained borderline significant in patients receiving chemotherapy (HR = 1.97, 95% CI 0.89-4.34, P = 0.09). In addition, a nonsynonymous SNP of APC gene was also significantly associated with recurrence risk in chemotherapy-treated patients (HR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.14-6.06 P = 0.02). Further analyses showed a combined effect of the two SNPs in predicting CRC recurrence in patients receiving chemotherapy (P = 0.04) but not in those without chemotherapy (P = 0.43). Moreover, an exploratory multivariate assessment model indicated that these two variants enhanced the power to predict recurrence after chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: We presented one of the first epidemiologic studies showing that stem cell-related genetic variants may impact CRC clinical outcomes, especially in chemotherapy-treated patients.
