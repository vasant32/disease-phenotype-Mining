Disturbance of miRNA expression may play a key role in the initiation and             progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC should be viewed as a heterogeneous             disease, but previous studies have only screened dysregulated miRNAs in CRC from             a panel of 96, 145, 287 and 455 miRNAs, respectively. It is necessary to identify             new aberrantly expressed miRNAs in rectal cancer. In this study tissue samples             were derived from patients undergoing a surgical procedure to remove a portion             of cancers. The expression profile of 904 miRNAs was analyzed using a miRCURYâ„¢             LNA Array from 6-paired rectal cancers and normal tissues. The expression levels             of 4 miRNAs were compared by real-time PCR between colon and rectal cancer, and             also the expression levels of metastatic miRNAs in different stages of rectal             cancer were analyzed. We found that 67 miRNA precursors are upregulated in rectal             cancer (p<0.05) and 21 of those have never been reported in colorectal cancer             (CRC); 39 miRNA precursors are downregulated (p<0.05) and 24 novel dysregulated             miRNAs were identified in rectal cancer. miR-31, miR-126 and miR-143 are differentially             expressed between colon cancer and rectal cancer. Here, we report an miRNA profile             of rectal cancer, and we identified differential expression patterns of miRNAs             between rectal and colon cancers. This novel information may suggest the potential             roles of these miRNAs in the diagnosis of rectal cancer.
