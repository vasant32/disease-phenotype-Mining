Colorectal cancer is (CRC) one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Various genetic factors have been reported to be involved in the development of colorectal cancers including Axin gene. Axin, a major scaffold protein, plays an important role in various bio signaling pathways. We aim to study mutational pattern of Axin gene in colorectal cancer patients of Kashmiri population. The paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue specimens of 50 consecutive patients with CRC were used in our study. The DNA preparations were evaluated for the occurrence of Axin 1 and Axin 2 gene mutations by direct DNA sequencing. We analyzed exon 1a, 1b, 1c, 2, 4, 6, and 10 of Axin 1 and exon 7 of Axin 2. In this study, we found a novel mutation of G>T (GCT>TCT) transversion in exon 7 of Axin 2 gene at codon G695T (p.alanine >Â serine) at a frequency of 6% (3/50). In the same exon of Axin 2 gene a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected in codon L688L (CCT>CTT) at a frequency of 36% (18/50). In exon 1c of Axin 1 a SNP was detected at codon D726D (GAT>GAC) at a frequency of 62.5% (31/50). Both the SNPs were synonymous hence do not lead to change of amino acid. Although Axin 1 and Axin 2 gene mutations have been found to be involved in the development of colorectal cancers, it seems to be a relatively rare event in Kashmiri population. However, an interesting finding of this study is the novelty of Axin 2 gene mutations which may be a predisposing factor in ethnic Kashmiri population to CRC.
