 BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: It is critical that the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is evaluated for determining the suitability of endoscopic resection for T1 colorectal cancer (CRC). Reported risk factors for LNM in completely resected T1 CRC are deep submucosal invasion, grade 3, angiolymphatic invasion, and budding. The aim of the present study was to identify the histopathologic factors associated with LNM in T1 CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 435 patients with T1 CRC treated by endoscopic or surgical resection between January 2001 and April 2010 at the National Cancer Center, Korea. The 435 patients were classified into two groups - those undergoing surgical resection (n = 324) and those undergoing endoscopic resection (n = 111). In the surgically resected group, details regarding depth of submucosal invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, tumor grade, budding, and background adenoma (BGA) were evaluated with respect to presence or absence of LNM. In the endoscopically resected group, the results of follow-ups and additional salvage surgeries were studied. RESULTS: In the surgically resected group, LNM was detected in 42 patients (13.0 %). Grade 3, angiolymphatic invasion, budding, and the absence of BGA were identified as factors associated with LNM in univariate and multivariate analyses (P < 0.05). Among the 50 patients in the endoscopically resected group with high risk, three were diagnosed as being LNM-positive during the follow-up period. There was no LNM in the endoscopically resected group with low risk. CONCLUSIONS: Grade 3, angiolymphatic invasion, budding, and the absence of BGA are the risk factors that predict LNM in patients with T1 CRC. In cases where endoscopically resected T1 CRC has no risk factor, cautious follow-up could be recommended. However, if the tumor has any risk factor, additional surgical resection should be considered.
