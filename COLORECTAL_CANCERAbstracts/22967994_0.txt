 BACKGROUND: As studies on gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinoma (WHO G3) (GI-NEC) are limited, we reviewed clinical data to identify predictive and prognostic markers for advanced GI-NEC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from advanced GI-NEC patients diagnosed 2000-2009 were retrospectively registered at 12 Nordic hospitals. RESULTS: The median survival was 11 months in 252 patients given palliative chemotherapy and 1 month in 53 patients receiving best supportive care (BSC) only. The response rate to first-line chemotherapy was 31% and 33% had stable disease. Ki-67<55% was by receiver operating characteristic analysis the best cut-off value concerning correlation to the response rate. Patients with Ki-67<55% had a lower response rate (15% versus 42%, P<0.001), but better survival than patients with Ki-67â‰¥55% (14 versus 10 months, P<0.001). Platinum schedule did not affect the response rate or survival. The most important negative prognostic factors for survival were poor performance status (PS), primary colorectal tumors and elevated platelets or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced GI-NEC patients should be considered for chemotherapy treatment without delay.PS, colorectal primary and elevated platelets and LDH levels were prognostic factors for survival. Patients with Ki-67<55% were less responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy, but had a longer survival. Our data indicate that it may not be correct to consider all GI-NEC as one single disease entity.
