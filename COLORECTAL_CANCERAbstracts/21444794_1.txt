Primary culture of the cancer cells from patients' tumors can provide crucial information of individual tumors, yet the technology has not been optimized until now. We developed an innovative culture method for primary colorectal cancer cells, based on the principle that cell-cell contact of cancer cells was maintained throughout the process. When tumor tissue was dissociated into cell clusters, in which cell-cell contact was retained, they rapidly formed spheroids that we termed cancer tissue-originated spheroids (CTOSs). CTOSs of colorectal cancer consisted of highly purified and viable cancer cells, and they were prepared with high efficiency. In immunodeficient mice, CTOSs formed xenograft tumors that retained the features of the parental tumors. Moreover, CTOSs were able to be cultured and expanded in vitro using a 3D culture system and stem cell culture medium. This method allowed evaluation of chemosensitivity and signal pathway activation in cancer cells from individual patients. Easy preparation and culture of pure primary cancer cells provides an innovative platform for studying cancer biology and developing personalized medicine.
