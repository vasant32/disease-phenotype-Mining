 OBJECTIVE: To investigate mRNA expression of caspase apoptosis pathway genes in colorectal cancer, polyps and normal mucosa. METHODS: Nineteen patients with colorectal cancer, 86 patients with polyps and 10 normal controls were enrolled from 2008 to 2010. Fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expression of caspase apoptosis pathway genes (caspase-2,-3,-6,-7,-8,-9 and -10) in colorectal cancer, polyps and normal mucosa. RESULT: There were no statistically significant differences of demographic characteristics between patients with colorectal cancer, patients with polyps and normal controls. Compared with normal control group, the mRNA expression of all selected genes except for caspase-3 were lower; however, the P values did not reach statistic significance. Highly positive correlations were observed between mRNA expression of all selected genes except caspase-9. CONCLUSION: There are no significant changes in mRNA expression levels of caspase apoptosis pathway genes from normal mucosa to polyps to cancer. The mRNA expressions of most caspase pathway genes are highly correlated with each other.
