 BACKGROUND: Several oxaliplatin-specific scales have been proposed in clinical practice to evaluate oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity. We investigated whether there might be a discrepancy between the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) and the Neurotoxicity Criteria of Debiopharm (DEB-NTC), the commonly used oxaliplatin-specific scales, in the evaluation of peripheral neurotoxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 42 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who received more than 6 cycles of first-line therapy with modified FOLFOX6 and more than 6 cycles of second-line therapy with FOLFIRI. The median number and cumulative dose of oxaliplatin administrations were 10.5 (range 6-22) and 889.4 mg/m(2) (range 484.5-1875.0 mg/m(2)), respectively. The peripheral neurotoxicity was evaluated during mFOLFOX6 therapy and after its discontinuation using NCI-CTCAE ver. 3.0 and DEB-NTC. Data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The concordance rate of the peripheral neurotoxicity grade determined by these criteria was low: 48.8% during mFOLFOX6 and 47.3% after discontinuation of therapy. The cumulative dose of oxaliplatin-related peripheral neurotoxicity in 50% of the patients was lower when evaluated by DEB-NTC for both grades 1 (P = 0.09) and 2 (P < 0.001). The cumulative rate of improvement from grade 2 to 1 (P < 0.001) and from grade 2 to 0 (P < 0.05) after discontinuation of mFOLFOX6 therapy was higher when NCI-CTCAE was used for the evaluation. CONCLUSION: We found a discrepancy between the NCI-CTCAE and DEB-NTC scales in the evaluation of oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity and suggest that the concomitant use of NCI-CTCAE and DEB-NTC would be useful to maintain oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy at higher quality.
