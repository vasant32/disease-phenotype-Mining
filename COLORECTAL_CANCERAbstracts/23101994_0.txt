Abstract   At the time of diagnosis, 20% to 25% of patients with colorectal cancer already have liver metastases, the presence of which is a most important prognostic factor. A 64-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for investigation of anemia and multiple liver tumors. Examinations revealed ascending colon carcinoma with more than 40 liver metastases and 2 lung metastases. We performed right hemicolectomy with lymph node dissection, which was followed by 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, oxaliplatin, plus bevacizumab (FOLFOX-BV). After 4 courses of chemotherapy, the lung metastases were in complete remission and the liver metastases had shrunk. We suggested the option of radical liver resection, but the patient declined initially as he had not suffered any severe side effects of FOLFOX-BV. After 23 courses of the chemotherapy, he agreed to undergo hepatectomy. We performed extended right lobectomy with partial left and caudal lobe resection. All of the macroscopic metastatic lesions were resected. Histopathologically, viable cancer cells were recognized in 7 of the 43 liver metastatic lesions. Postoperatively, FOLFOX-BV was restarted and continued for 10 months. At the time of writing, 15 months after the hepatectomy, the patient was well without evidence of recurrence of the cancer.
