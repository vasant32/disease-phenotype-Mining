 OBJECTIVE: Yttrium-90 radioembolisation (Y90-RE) is recommended for unresectable, chemorefractory liver-dominant disease; however, the incidence of extrahepatic disease (EHD) is high. FDG-PET may have additional value to CT in demonstrating EHD. Our aim was to evaluate the added diagnostic value of FDG-PET to abdominal CT and study the influence of FDG-PET findings on treatment decisions. METHODS: All consecutive patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM) referred for Y90-RE were included. Patients who underwent both CT and FDG-PET in the diagnostic workup were selected. Imaging reports were scrutinised for documented sites of EHD, and changes of management due to FDG-PET findings were determined. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included. Findings on CT and FDG-PET matched in 20 patients (no EHD, n = 15; identical EHD, n = 5). In 4 patients, lesions detected on CT were not FDG-avid, and in 18 patients, FDG-PET showed more lesions than CT (P < 0.05). In 7/42 patients (17 %) a change of management was made based on the additional FDG-PET findings, i.e. exclusion from Y90-RE treatment (n = 6) and change in treatment plan (whole liver rather than segmental treatment, n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRCLM referred for Y90-RE, FDG-PET showed significantly more EHD and led to a considerable change of management. KEY POINTS : • Yttrium-90 radioembolisation is a locoregional treatment for liver tumours • Detection of extrahepatic lesions, for which CT is widely used, is crucial • FDG-PET shows significantly more extrahepatic lesions compared to CT • FDG-PET findings led to a considerable change in treatment decisions.
