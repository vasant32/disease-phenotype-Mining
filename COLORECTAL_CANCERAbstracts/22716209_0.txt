The traditional staging system is currently inadequate for identifying those patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC) who carry a high risk for poor outcome. In this study, the expression of E-cadherin was evaluated in CRC to determine its correlation with clinico-pathological variables, and association with disease outcome in patients with long-term follow-up. The present series consisted of tissue samples obtained from 230 patients with stage I, II, III, or IV CRC treated during 1981-1990 at Turku University Hospital. Archival paraffin-embedded samples were used to build up tissue microarray blocks, and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry using an automated staining system. Different grading systems were tested for expression of E-cadherin. Fifty-nine percent of all tumors were positive for E-Cadherin. There was no significant correlation between E-cadherin expression and gender (p < 0.83), localization (p < 0.45), tumor invasion (p < 0.32), or histologic grade (p < 0.41). However, loss of E-cadherin expression was significantly associated with older age (p < 0.03) and lymph node involvement (p < 0.02), and with borderline significance with advanced stage (p < 0.09) and tumor metastasis (p < 0.09). In univariate (Kaplan-Meier) survival analysis, positive E-cadherin significantly (p = 0.009) predicted longer disease-free survival (DFS), and the same was true with disease-specific survival (DSS) as well (p = 0.007). In multivariate (Cox) survival analysis, E-cadherin retained its significance as independent predictor of DFS (HR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.01-2.42, p = 0.043), but not DSS. A sub-group analysis revealed that E-cadherin expression also predicts DFS (p < 0.01) and DSS (p < 0.04) in stage II CRC. Our results implicate the usefulness of E-cadherin expression in predicting disease recurrence and long-term survival in CRC.
