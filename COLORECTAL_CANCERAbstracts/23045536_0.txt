 BACKGROUND: Patient navigation (PN) has been suggested as a way to reduce cancer health disparities; however, many models of PN exist and most have not been carefully evaluated. The goal of this study was to test the Ohio American Cancer Society model of PN as it relates to reducing time to diagnostic resolution among persons with abnormal breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening tests or symptoms. METHODS: A total of 862 patients from 18 clinics participated in this group-randomized trial. Chart review documented the date of the abnormality and the date of resolution. The primary analysis used shared frailty models to test for the effect of PN on time to resolution. Crude HR were reported as there was no evidence of confounding. RESULTS: HRs became significant at 6 months; conditional on the random clinic effect, the resolution rate at 15 months was 65% higher in the PN arm (P = 0.012 for difference in resolution rate across arms; P = 0.009 for an increase in the HR over time). CONCLUSIONS: Participants with abnormal cancer screening tests or symptoms resolved faster if assigned to PN compared with those not assigned to PN. The effect of PN became apparent beginning six months after detection of the abnormality. IMPACT: PN may help address health disparities by reducing time to resolution after an abnormal cancer screening test.
