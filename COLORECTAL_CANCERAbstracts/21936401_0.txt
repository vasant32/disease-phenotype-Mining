Resveratrol (Res) can modulate multiple cellular pathways relevant for tumorigenesis but is less effective in colon cancer compared to breast cancer. To increase the chemopreventive potential of Res in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a systematic study was carried out in colon cancer cells. HCT-116 cells were treated with Res and 5-FU and several cell-based assays, such as MTT, clonogenic, wound healing, DAPI, comet assay, and Western blot, were performed. A significant inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and increased apoptosis were observed when moderate concentration of Res (15 microM) was associated with very low concentration of 5-FU (0.5 microM). This combination caused apoptosis by blocking the cells at S phase and enhanced the DNA damage. Expression levels of p-JNK and p-p38 were increased without affecting pERK. 5-FU could be used as a therapeutic modality to improve efficacy of Res-based chemotherapy against colon cancer.
