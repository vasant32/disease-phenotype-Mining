The purpose of this study was to accurately detect lymph-node micrometastases, i.e., metastatic cancer foci that have a size between 2.0 and 0.2 mm, in nodes excised from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, and to determine how frequently micrometastases might be missed when standard histological examination procedures are used. A total of 311 lymph nodes were removed and examined from 90 patients with Stage I to IV CRC. The number of slices of histology sections ranged from 6 to 75 per node (average = 25.5; SD = 11.1), which provided a total of 7,943 slices. Lymph nodes were examined in their entire volume at every 50-μm and 100-μm intervals for nodes smaller and larger than 5 mm respectively. The total number of thin sections examined in each node and the number of thin sections where metastatic foci were present were counted. The number of thin sections with metastatic foci and the total number of slices was determined for each node. In addition, the presence or absence of metastatic foci in the "central" slice was determined. Micrometastases were found in 12/311 (3.9%) of all lymph nodes. In the 12 lymph nodes with micrometastases, the rate of metastatic slices over all slices was 39.4% (range = 6.3 to 81.3%; SD = 25.8%) In the central slice of each node, micrometastases were present only in 6 of 12 lymph nodes (50%); accordingly, they were not present in the central slice for half the micrometastatic nodes. These 6 nodes represented 1.9% of the 311 nodes and 11.1% of the 54 metastatic nodes. This study suggests that a significant fraction of micrometastases can be missed by traditional singleslice sectioning; half of the micrometastases would have been overlooked in our data set of 311 nodes.
