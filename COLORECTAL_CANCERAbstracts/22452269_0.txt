 PURPOSE: To study quality of life (QoL) in patients with liver metastases from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) following liver transplantation (Ltx). METHODS: Ten patients participated in a prospective explorative pilot study. Inclusion criteria were nonresectable liver-only metastases determined by CT/MRI-, PET/CT- scans and colonoscopy, and ECOG 0-1. Primary outcome was QoL assessed by the EORTC-C30 questionnaires at baseline, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after Ltx. RESULTS: The patients' age ranged from 50 to 63 years. Nine of 10 patients were observed for 12 months. One patient did not return the form at 6 months and died shortly after because of recurrence of the malignant disease. Compared to baseline, Ltx resulted in sustained excellent global health status scale (score of 100) in one patient, improved scores in 4 and unchanged scores in 3 patients at 12 months. The majority of the patients also reported good functional scores at follow-ups. Although two patients had marked symptoms both before and after Ltx, the patients in general reported low levels of pain and fatigue before and after surgery. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that CRC patients with liver-only metastases who receive Ltx have good QoL and have mostly minor symptoms the first year after Ltx.
