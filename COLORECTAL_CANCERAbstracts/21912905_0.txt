Our aim was to examine cell transition events by detecting the frequency of intrapithelial α-smooth muscle actin (SMA)(+)/cytokeratin (CK)(+) cells during colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence, in relation to E-cadherin expression. Our further aim was to determine the proliferative activity of intraepithelial α-SMA(+) cells. Histologically healthy, adenoma, and colorectal cancer (CRC) biopsy samples were taken during routine colonoscopy and were included into tissue microarrays (TMAs). Slides immunostained for Ki-67, α-SMA, E-cadherin and pan-cytokeratin were digitalized and analyzed by using a digital microscope software. The proportion of α-SMA(+)/CK(+) cells was significantly higher in CRC samples (3.34 ± 1.01%) compared to healthy (1.94 ± 0.69%) or adenoma (1.62 ± 0.78%) samples (p < 0.01). E-cadherin expression negatively correlated with the number of α-SMA(+) cells. The majority of intraepithelial α-SMA(+) cells were in the proliferative phase. During tumor progression, the appearance of dot-like α-SMA staining in CK positive cells may indicate the initial phase of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The high proportion of intraepithelial α-SMA(+) proliferating cells may refer to their increased plasticity compared to differentiated cells. The negative correlation between E-cadherin and intraepithelial α-SMA expression suggests that EMT is facilitated by a loss of epithelial cell contact.
