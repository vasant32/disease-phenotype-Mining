Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between Rho-kinase (ROCK1 and ROCK2) gene polymorphisms and colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Methods: Eighty-five patients operated due to CRC and 178 healthy controls with similar age and sex were included to this study. Genomic DNA from the patients and the healthy control cases was analyzed by a BioMark 96.96 dynamic array system. The protein expressions of ROCK1, ROCK2 and p53 were determined by immunohistochemical staining. Results: There were significant associations between ROCK1 (rs73963110 and rs35996865) and ROCK2 gene polymorphisms (rs2290156, rs10178332, rs35768389, rs10929732 and rs34945852) with CRC development. However, no marked associations were found between ROCK2 gene rs965665, rs2230774, rs6755196 and rs1515219 polymorphisms and the risk of developing CRC. Rho-kinase and p53 immunohistochemical stainings were markedly elevated in the tumor tissue. There were significant correlations between vascular and perineural invasions with ROCK2 or p53 protein expressions. Conclusions: These results are the first to demonstrate the contribution of Rho-kinase in CRC development in patients. Our data showed that the ROCK1 and ROCK2 genes might be a risk factor for CRC development and that genetic polymorphisms in these genes may modify individual susceptibility to CRC in the Turkish population.
