Induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-like cancer cells (iPC) by the introduction             of defined transcription factors reduce the prevalence of the malignant phenotype             of digestive system cancer cells, but the induction efficiency is low. The role             of hypoxia and TP53 deficiency in iPC cell generation remain unclear. Cellular             reprogramming was performed by retroviral infection with OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and             c-MYC of wild-type HCT116 colorectal cancer cells and mutant TP53-deficient HCT116             cells. Cells were cultured in normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (5% O2) for 30 days             after transduction, and the response to hypoxia and comparison of cellular proliferation,             invasion and tumourigenesis before and after iPC cell generation were studied.             iPC cell generation from wild-type HCT116 cells in hypoxia was approximately 4-times             greater than in normoxia (p<0.05), and TP53 deficiency increased conversion             efficiency significantly in normoxia (p<0.05). Significant involvement of hypoxia-inducible             factors was observed in an immature carbohydrate epitope, Tra-1-60+, colony formation.             Generated iPC cells exhibited multi-differentiation potential. Although the iPC             cells in hypoxia exhibited reduced proliferation, invasiveness and tumourigenicity,             TP53 deficiency in iPC cells resulted in higher tumourigenicity than in wild-type             cells. Both hypoxia and TP53 deficiency increase iPC cell generation. TP53 deficiency             can also result in deleterious mutations, whereas hypoxia may impact molecular             targets of epigenome normalisation.
