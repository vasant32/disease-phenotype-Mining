Aim:  The study involved a large nationwide Danish cohort to evaluate the hypothesis that a high lymph node harvest has a positive effect on survival on curative resected Stage I-III colon cancer and a low lymph node ratio has a positive effect on survival in Stage III colon cancer. Method:  Analysis of overall survival was conducted using a nationwide Danish cohort of patients treated with curative resection of stage I-III colon cancer. All 8901 patients in Denmark diagnosed with adenocacinoma of the colon and treated with curative resection in the period 2003-2008 were identified from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG). The impact of lymph node count and lymph node ratio was analysed. Results:  Overall 5-year survival was 56.8% and 66.6%, (p< .0001) for lymph node counts of <12 and >= 12, respectively. The percentages of lymph node positive patients in the two groups were 29.8% and 40.3% (p< .0001), respectively. When subgrouping the stage III patients into four groups according to the lymph node ratio (cut-off points: 1/12, 1/4 and 1/2) we found an overall 5-year survival rate of 68.1%, 57.2%, 49.3% and 32.4% (p< .0001). Lymph node count and lymph node ratio were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusion:  High lymph node count was associated with improved overall survival in colon cancer. Lymph node ratio was superior to N-stage, in differentiating overall survival in stage III colon cancer. Stage migration was observed. © 2012 The Authors Colorectal Disease © 2012 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland.
