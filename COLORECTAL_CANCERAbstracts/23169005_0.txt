Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) play crucial roles in angiogenesis, which contributes to the development and progression of solid tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of VEGF (-2578C > A, -1154G > A, -634G > C, and 936C > T) and KDR (-604T > C and 1192G > A) polymorphisms with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). A total of 882 participants (390 CRC patients and 492 controls) were enrolled in the study. The genotyping of VEGF and KDR polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. We found that the CT and TT genotype of the 936C > T was associated with an increased risk of CRC compared with the CC genotype as the dominant model for the T allele. In addition, we also found a increased CRC risk with TC + CC genotype of KDR -604T > C compared with TT genotype in CRC patients and control subjects. Similarly, KDR 1192G > A also showed significant association between 1192G > A variants and risk of CRC. In the haplotype analyses, haplotype -2578A/-1154A/-634G/936T of VEGF polymorphisms and haplotype -604C/1192G and -604C/1192A of KDR polymorphisms were associated with an increased susceptibility of CRC. Our results suggest that the VEGF 936C > T, KDR -604T > C, and KDR 1192G > A polymorphisms may be contribute to CRC risk in the Korean population. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
