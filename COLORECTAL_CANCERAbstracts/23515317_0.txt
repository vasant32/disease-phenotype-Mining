 AIM: To assess the outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection in the octogenarian population at our institution. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of registry data accumulated prospectively were used in conjunction with the data obtained from patient notes to identify outcome data for octogenarians who had undergone elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection. RESULTS: Laparoscopic colorectal cancer resections were performed in 68 octogenarians between 2003 and 2011 at our institution. Four operations (6%) were converted to an open technique. There were twelve cases of morbidity (18%) and two cases of mortality (3%). The overall median hospital stay was 8 d. The median time for a patient to be deemed surgically fit for discharge was 5 d reflecting a delay in provision of social care or stoma education. CONCLUSION: Our results support the view that laparoscopic surgery in octogenarians is safe, feasible and with a reduced length of stay. This is well reflected in our results which are compatible with United Kingdom national figures.
