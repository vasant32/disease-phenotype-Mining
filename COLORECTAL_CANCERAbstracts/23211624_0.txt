The aim of this study is to raise tumor-suppressing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against colorectal carcinomas. Here, we generated a novel mAb 3P9, targeted a cancer-associated carbohydrate antigen sialyl-Tn (sTn), which showed significant inhibitory effect on proliferation and migration of sTn cells and tumor growth by inducing apoptosis. We also demonstrated that mAb 3P9 showed higher sensitivity and specificity in immunohistochemistry assay on colonic adenocarcinoma than the broadly used commercial anti-sTn antibody B72.3. These results provide the first evidence that mAb 3P9 has potential applications, not only for diagnosis but also for antibody-based tumor therapy.
