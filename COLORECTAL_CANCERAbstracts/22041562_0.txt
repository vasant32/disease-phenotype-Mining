 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a colorectal cancer screening program by tumor detection rate and discussing its application values. METHOD: In total, 43 713 subjects were recruited in the screening program who were the registered people aged 40 - 74 in Xiacheng and Jiashan during year 2007 - 2009. The first screening involved questionnaire survey of colorectal cancer related risk factors and fecal occult blood test (FOBT), colonoscopy was performed when a positive result was observed in the first screening. If polyps were found during colonoscopy, biopsy and pathological diagnosis were carried out. The screening data were analyzed and the tumor detection rate was calculated according to age or sex. RESULTS: 6489 subjects (14.85%) belonged to the high risk group of colorectal cancer in the first screening, in which 4701 subjects finished complete colonoscopy. Finally, 569 colorectal neoplasm were diagnosed, the detection rate was 12.10% (95%CI: 11.17% - 13.04%). It included 52 colorectal cancer (1.11%, 95%CI: 0.81% - 1.41%), 183 advanced adenoma (3.89%, 95%CI: 3.34% - 4.45%), 334 non-advanced adenoma (7.10%, 95%CI: 6.37% - 7.84%). The highest detective rate was observed in male group that aged 70 - 74 (22.81%, 95%CI: 16.98% - 28.70%), the lowest detective rate was observed in female group aged 40 - 44 (2.49%, 95%CI: 0.79% - 4.20%). CONCLUSION: The current colorectal cancer screening program in China works well, but the revision of the program is necessary.
