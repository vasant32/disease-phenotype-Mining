PURPOSE: This study evaluated the prognostic value of early recurrence in patients who have undergone curative resection for colorectal cancer. METHODS: A total of 1,159 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for non-metastatic colorectal cancer from December 1998 to December 2007 were reviewed. The predictive factors for early recurrence postoperatively and the prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 1,159 patients, postoperative recurrence was identified in 280 (24.1 %) patients, and 96 (34.3 %) of the 280 patients with recurrence were designed as early recurrence (less than 1 year postoperatively). In multivariate analysis, tumor location, tumor diameter, number of retrieved lymph nodes, and lymphovascular invasion were the independent predictors for early recurrence. The early recurrence group had a significantly lower overall survival rate than that of the non-early recurrence group for both colon cancer (P < 0.001) and rectal cancer (P < 0.001). The overall survival rate for stage III tumors significantly differed between the early and non-early recurred patients (P < 0.001), whereas the rate did not differ between the patients with stage II tumors (P = 0.364). In multivariate analysis, early recurrence was an independent predictor for unfavorable overall survival. Moreover, differentiation, N category, and postoperative chemotherapy were the independent predictors for overall survival for the patients with both early and overall recurrence. CONCLUSION: Poor survival was associated with early postoperative recurrence for patients who underwent curative resection for colorectal cancer. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy prolonged the survival of patients, irrespective of the interval of recurrence.
