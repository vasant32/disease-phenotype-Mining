Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) was proposed for untreatable colorectal liver metastases. The present study evaluates tumor control and potential radiotoxicity of BNCT in an experimental model of liver metastasis. BDIX rats were inoculated with syngeneic colon cancer cells DHD/K12/TRb. Tumor-bearing animals were divided into three groups: BPA-BNCT, boronophenylalanine (BPA) + neutron irradiation; Beam only, neutron irradiation; Sham, matched manipulation. The total absorbed dose administered with BPA-BNCT was 13 ± 3 Gy in tumor and 9 ± 2 Gy in healthy liver. Three weeks post-treatment, the tumor surface area post-treatment/pre-treatment ratio was 0.46 ± 0.20 for BPA-BNCT, 2.7 ± 1.8 for Beam only and 4.5 ± 3.1 for Sham. The pre-treatment tumor nodule mass of 48 ± 19 mg fell significantly to 19 ± 16 mg for BPA-BNCT, but rose significantly to 140 ± 106 mg for Beam only and to 346 ± 302 mg for Sham. For both end points, the differences between the BPA-BNCT group and each of the other groups were statistically significant (ANOVA). No clinical, macroscopic or histological normal liver radiotoxicity was observed. It is concluded that BPA-BNCT induced a significant remission of experimental colorectal tumor nodules in liver with no contributory liver toxicity.
