VÃ©gran and colleagues proposed a model in which the lactate released from tumor cells through MCT4 would be taken up by endothelial cells via the MCT1 transporter and stimulate angiogenesis, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as model of tumor endothelial cells. By analyzing a total of 505 cases of human tumor samples immunostained for MCT1, we do not confirm plasma membrane expression of MCT1 in the endothelial cells of tumor-associated vessels.
