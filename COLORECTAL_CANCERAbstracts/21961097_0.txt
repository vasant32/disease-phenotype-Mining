 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) is a small secretory glycoprotein with anti-apoptosis and anti-matrix metalloproteinase activity. There have been some discordant data regarding the value of TIMP-1 as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. To address this controversy, we conducted a meta-analysis for the relationship between TIMP-1 levels and overall survival in CRC. METHODS: We selected the relevant published studies using citation databases including PubMed, Science Citation Index, and Conference Papers Index. The effect sizes of TIMP-1 on the patient's overall survival and TNM stages were calculated by hazard ratio (HR) or odds ratio (OR), respectively. The effect sizes were combined using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Survival outcomes between high and low plasma or serum TIMP-1 levels were compared by uni- and multivariate analyses involving 1,477 and 1,359 CRC patients, respectively. CRC patients with high plasma or serum TIMP-1 levels showed poor survival rates compared to patients with low plasma or serum TIMP-1 in the uni- and multivariate analyses (HR, 2.2 and 2.1; P < 0.001). In addition, high TIMP-1 expression in colon cancer tissues was significantly associated with worse survival outcomes in 438 CRC patients (HR = 1.4; P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: Plasma or serum TIMP-1 levels predict survival outcomes of CRC patients.
