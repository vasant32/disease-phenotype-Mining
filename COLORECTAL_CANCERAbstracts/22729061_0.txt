 AIM: To determine the nature and prevalence of colonic and extracolonic findings in our population. METHODS: All patients who underwent computed tomographic colonography (CTC) in the 72-month period from 1 January 2004 to 1 January 2010 were included in the analysis. Demographic data and CTC findings were recorded, according to the CT colonography reporting and data system (CRADS). RESULTS: There were 2152 consecutive CTC patients; comprising 52.6% female, average age of 60 years; range 19-87. Approximately 84% were symptomatic. CRADS: Colonic findings: 99/2152 patients (4.6%) were C2 category (had 1 or 2 polyps of 6-9 mm). 77/2152 (3.6%) patients were C3 category (>9 mm polyp or >2 polyps of 6-9 mm). 55/2152 (2.5%) were C4 category (possible cancer). This comprises a total potential colonoscopy/surgery referral rate of 10.7%. Extracolonic findings: The majority were normal or clinically unimportant findings. 178/2152 (8.3%) had potentially significant extracolonic findings. CONCLUSION: Our CTC population is largely symptomatic, and there is a referral rate from CTC to colonoscopy, surgery or surveillance of 10.7%. This is similar to other NZ data and international studies. The 8.3% rate of potentially significant extracolonic findings is at the lower end of the reported range.
