 AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Lower gastrointestinal (LGI) diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Colonoscopy holds an important place in screening, diagnosing and treatment of these conditions. In Nigeria, as in many other developing countries, the facility for performing colonoscopy is rarely available. This prospective report seeks to evaluate the demographic data of patients presenting for colonoscopy, the pattern and validity of referral diagnosis versus colonoscopy findings in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients who had colonoscopy procedure done in the Endoscopy Unit of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex between January 2007 and December 2011 were included in the study. RESULTS: During the study period, colonoscopy was carried out in 320 patients. One hundred and eighty two (56.9%) were males, while 138 (43.1%) were females. The median age was 59.5 years. Their ages ranged from 2-87 years. The most common indications were lower gastrointestinal bleeding and change in bowel habit which together accounted for 79.0%. No abnormality was seen in 93(29.1%) patients. Abnormal endoscopic findings included 66(20.6%) patients who had haemorrhoids, 50(15.6%) cases colorectal cancer, 33 (10.3%) patients had benign polyps and (30 (9.4%) patients had diverticular disease. Other findings were colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, rectovaginal fistula, vascular ectasia and extra luminal compression. Haemorrhoids, diverticulosis and polyps were the most common findings in patients presenting with lower gastrointestinal bleeding Conclusion: This present report showed that colonoscopy is a cheap, safe and effective method of investigating lower gastrointestinal disease in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. When the indication is based on symptoms, the diagnostic yield could be as high as 90%. The common causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in Ile-Ife, Nigeria include haemorrhoids, diverticulosis and polyps.
