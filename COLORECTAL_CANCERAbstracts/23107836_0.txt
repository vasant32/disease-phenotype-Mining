 OBJECTIVE: Surgical resection of asymptomatic primary colorectal cancer in patients presenting with synchronous unresectable metastatic disease is controversial. Concerns and controversies remain over combining cytotoxic chemotherapy with bevacizumab in this patient population. METHODS: We identified medical records of 99 patients with synchronous metastatic primary colorectal cancer who received chemotherapy with bevacizumab as their initial treatment. The incidence of subsequent use of surgery and surgical outcomes were recorded. Patients were also assessed for overall survival. RESULTS: Patients who received bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy for synchronous metastatic primary colorectal cancer were divided into the non-surgery and surgery groups according to the resection status of their asymptomatic primary tumor. In the non-surgery group, two patients (4.4%) underwent additional surgery, while three patients (5.7%) required surgery for rectovesical fistula in the surgery group. The median overall survival was 17 months for the non-surgery group (95% CI: 10.6-23.3 months) and 23 months for the surgery group (95% CI: 21.3-24.6 months; P = 0.322). CONCLUSIONS: This study utilizing chemotherapy with bevacizumab did not result in an increased rate of morbidity related to the unresected primary tumor. Survival is not compromised by leaving the primary colon tumor intact.
