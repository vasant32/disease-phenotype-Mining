 BACKGROUND: Critical to successful execution of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis is apoptosome formation and subsequent activation of caspases. Defects in this pathway have an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis and chemoresistance; therefore, the expression of apoptosome-associated proteins may be associated with clinical outcome and response to chemotherapy. METHODS: Here we performed a systematic analysis of the immunohistochemical expression of the key proteins involved in apoptosome-dependent caspase activation (APAF1, Pro-caspases 9 and 3, SMAC, and XIAP) in a cohort of Stage II and III colorectal cancer patients from a Phase III trial of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy vs postoperative observation alone. RESULTS: Survival analysis indicated that of the apoptosome-associated proteins examined here, Pro-caspase 3 and APAF1 have potential clinical utility as predictive markers in Stage II and III colorectal cancer, respectively. Interestingly, we identified APAF1 staining to be associated with better recurrence-free and overall survival in patients receiving chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: These studies reveal the importance of the apoptosome-dependent caspase activation pathway, specifically Pro-caspase 3 and APAF1 proteins, for predicting both prognosis and response to therapy.
