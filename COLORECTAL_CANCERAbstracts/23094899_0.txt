 OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the association between bilateral inguinal hernias and colorectal cancers. PURPOSE: Inguinal hernias are one of the most common subjects in surgical practice and have been known to be associated with some other pathologies since 1831. Although there are some series in literature reporting the association of colorectal cancers with inguinal hernias, it is still controversial to perform colorectal diagnostic tools in hernia patients. Colorectal cancers are particularly accused to be in association with synchronous bilateral hernias as they increase the intra-abdominal pressure. METHODS: Rectosigmoidoscopy was performed in 110 consecutive bilateral hernia patients and the results were recorded prospectively. Patients having colorectal diseases were excluded. RESULTS: There were no pathologies in 87 (%79,1) rectosigmoidoscopies, while benign pathologies (hemorrhoids, polyps and diverticulitis) were diagnosed in 23 (%20,9). CONCLUSIONS: It has not been proved yet that colorectal cancers increase the incidence of bilateral inguinal hernias. The incidence of benign pathologies in our series was similar to that of same age population without hernia. As a conclusion of this study we believe that rectosigmoidoscopy is not necessary for synchronous bilateral hernias unless the patient has any complaints or risk factors. Colorectal screening tools are performed when the clinical findings or the story of the patient support colorectal cancers) (Tab. 1, Ref. 25).
