 PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the qualitative changes in the amount of acid mucin in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) compared to normal colon. METHODS: A total number of 100 samples were examined, 50 were colorectal cancer samples (cases) and 50 were normal (controls), all were stained with Alcian blue method. RESULTS: Acid mucin increased, in different levels, in 30 (60%) of the cases compared to only six (12%) of controls (P < 0.0001). However, complete absence of acid mucin was detected among 10 (20%) of cases compared to none among controls. CONCLUSIONS: CRC is associated with secretion of increased amounts of acid mucin in most cases, and that should be considered as a valuable histological finding.
