Every year, approximately 1 million new colorectal cancer (CRC) cases are diagnosed and about half a million people worldwide die due to this cancer. Known differences in CRC incidence rates are mainly attributed to differences in diet and other environmental factors represented, among others, by nutrition-related complex diseases (e.g. obesity and diabetes mellitus type II). Within the last years, it has become evident that environmental risk factors can be complemented by a genetic component when considering the risk of CRC. For example, a number of polymorphisms are known to be associated with an increased risk of obesity and obesity is a risk factor for CRC. Several studies have shown that the 'ancestral-susceptibility model' can be reasonably applied to nutrition-related complex diseases such as obesity. The work in hand shortly discusses whether the ancestral-susceptibility model can also be applied to CRC as a nutrition-related complex disease.
