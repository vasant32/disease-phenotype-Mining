Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancer types and the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the western world. Generally, colorectal cancers are resistant to anticancer drugs. Several lines of evidence support a critical role for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) during colorectal tumorigenesis and its role in chemoresistance. In this study, we focused our interest on the role played by COX-2 in apoptosis induced in HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells by ursolic acid (UA), a triterpenoid found in a large variety of plants. We showed that UA-induced apoptosis and that COX-2 was overexpressed only in apoptotic cells. We demonstrated that this overexpression was mediated by the p38 MAP kinase pathway as inhibiting its activation using a p38-specific inhibitor, SB 203580, abrogated COX-2 expression. Inhibiting COX-2 expression either by using a p38-specific inhibitor or COX-2-specific siRNA increased apoptosis. These results demonstrated that COX-2 was involved in a resistance mechanism to UA-induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Cells undergoing apoptosis were able to trigger a resistance mechanism by overexpressing a protein such as COX-2 to delay their death. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this resistance mechanism was independent of PGE(2) production as the addition of the specific COX-2 activity inhibitor, NS-398, did not affect apoptosis in UA-treated cells.
