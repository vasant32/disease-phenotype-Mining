In order to determine the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions of chemotherapy and verapamil infusion through a target artery to treat colorectal cancer patients with metastasis after failure with previous conventional treatments. Patients with metastatic colon cancer (n = 36) received an infusion of verapamil, interleukin-2, oxaliplatin (or hydroxy camptothecin or irinotecan hydrochloride), fluorouracil and calcium folinate through target artery using the Seldinger puncture technique. From the second day of infusion, the patients were treated with fluorouracil and calcium folinate via systematic intravenous injection for 2-3 days. Efficacy was evaluated after at least two treatment courses. The objective response including complete or partial response was 58.3% in the 36 patients; clinical benefit rate, evaluated by Karnofsky Performance Status score was 91.7%; by weight was 83.3%; by the amount of painkiller consumed was 80.6%. No patient experienced side effects associated with heart function. Post-treatment, the P-R period, Q-T period, QRS, and heart rate were not significantly different than before treatment. Liver function was significantly improved. Side effects of chemotherapy were minor in comparison to those observed with intravenous chemotherapy. Infusion of verapamil and chemotherapy directly into pelvic tumor tissue can increase treatment efficacy and has been shown to be a relatively safe technique.
