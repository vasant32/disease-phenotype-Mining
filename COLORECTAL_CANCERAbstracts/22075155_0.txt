CD43 has conflicting roles in both pro- and anti-adhesive function in cell-to-cell adhesion in hematopoietic cells. We examined the role of CD43 glycoprotein in a colorectal carcinoma cell line. We expressed human CD43 antigen on HT-29 cells, a colon adenocarcinoma cell line, and compared the adhesion to the extracellular matrix with that of mock-transduced cells in vitro. CD43 expression inhibited the adhesion to extracellular matrix, such as collagen type IV and laminin. As the expression of Î²1 integrin was downregulated in CD43-expressing HT-29 cells, the anti-adhesive effect of CD43 might be implicated in its expression. Our findings suggest that the anti-adhesive function of CD43 in colon carcinoma cells plays a role in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of colorectal carcinoma cells.
