 PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study is to characterise the lymphatic vessel density (LVD) in the T3 colorectal carcinoma and to correlate it with N status, grading and presence of tumour budding. METHODS: A total of 56 cases of T3 colorectal carcinoma were retrieved from the pathology's archive of Klinikum Augsburg. All slides were stained immunohistochemically with D2-40 (lymphatic endothelium) and with pancytokeratin to assess the tumour budding. Tumour budding and lymph vessel density were investigated independently by BM and CC. The highest density of lymphatic vessels was counted both in tumour centre (ILVD) and at the periphery of the tumour (PLVD) within an area of 0.24 mm(2). RESULTS: Due to the strong intra-observer (BM and CC) difference in ILVD and PLVD, all cases were re-evaluated establishing a consensus that has been used for the further analyses. There was a significant difference between PLVD and ILVD (12 ± 4 versus 6 ± 3; P < 0.001). Moreover, we found a non-significant trend towards high PLVD in the cases with nodal metastasis versus the negative one, 13 ± 5/hpf versus 11 ± 4 (P = 0.072). There was no association between tumour budding and ILVD and PLVD (P = 0.249 and 0.38). CONCLUSION: Colorectal carcinoma induces lymphangiogenesis. A higher PLVD could increase the capability of cancer cell to invade the lymphatic system. However, the obvious difficulties in immunohistochemical evaluation and the rather small differences between nodal positive and negative cases in T3 colorectal cancer seem to limit the clinical value of LVD evaluation.
