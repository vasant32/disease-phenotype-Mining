 PURPOSE: This study is to investigate the value of double contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (DCEU) in assessing microcirculation of colorectal adenocarcinomas and to describe the perfusion features of the tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS: DCEUS was performed in 42 patients with adenocarcinoma. The time-intensity curve parameters (arrival time (AT), time-to-peak (TTP), peak intensity (PI) and area under the curve (AUC)) within the tumours were extracted. The parameters were compared among the tumours with different CEUS features and stages. RESULTS: The mean values of AT, TTP, PI and AUC of the colorectal adenocarcinomas were 13.68±13.36s, 32.61±19.56s, 19.82±16.54dB and 271.10±159.19dBs, respectively. In the adenocarcinomas with necrosis, the mean values of AUC was significantly lower than that of the adenocarcinomas without (231.10±219.27dBs, 278.10±123.20dBs, p=0.004). In the adenocarcinomas with necrosis, the AUC and PI of the non-necrotic part were significantly higher than that of the necrotic part (p=0.007, 0.0025, respectively). AUC increased progressively in the subgroups of T2, T3 and T4 and the difference of AUC between T2 and T4 subgroup was significant (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Double contrast-enhanced ultrasonography is a valuable technique for quantifying tumour vascularity of colorectal adenocarcinomas. AUC was significantly different in the subgroups of different T stage. AUC and PI could reflect the different perfusion status of tumours with or without necrosis.
