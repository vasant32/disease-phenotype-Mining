DNA methylation is an epigenetic event that plays a role in gene expression regulation. Alterations in DNA methylation contribute to cancer development and progression. The aim of this study was to identify gene promoters aberrantly methylated in colorectal tumor tissue in comparison to normal colonic mucosa. Analyses were performed on two pooled DNA samples: from normal and cancerous tissue obtained from CRC patients. DNA was fractionated according to methylation degree with the use of affinity column containing methyl-CpG binding domain. To identify novel hypermethylated gene promoters, methylated DNA from normal and from cancerous tissues were analyzed with the use of promoter microarrays. We identified nine novel genes hypermethylated in colorectal cancer. The frequency of their promoter methylation was assessed in the larger group of patients (n = 77): KCNK12 (methylated in 41% of CRC patients), GPR101 (40%), CDH2 (45%), BARX1 (56%), CNTFR (22%), SYT6 (64%), SMO (21%), EPHA5 (43%), and GSPT2 (21%). The results of gene expression level analysis suggest the role of promoter methylation in downregulation of six out of nine genes examined. We did not find correlation between gene methylation and age, gender, tumor grade or stage. Importantly, in stage IV CRC methylation of GPR101 correlated with longer time to progression (P = 0.0042; HR = 2.5468; 95% CI 1.5391-10.0708).
