PURPOSE: The study aimed to explore the gender difference in using colorectal cancer (CRC) tests among Chinese aged 50 years or over. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2004 Chinese older adults through anonymous telephone survey which covered socio-demographic variables, health status, use of complementary therapy, health-related perceptions and use of CRC tests. RESULTS: The uptake rate of flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS)/colonoscopy was 14% for males and 10% for females, with males significantly more likely to have had the test after adjusting for their differences in socio-demographics, health status, use of complementary therapies, health-related perceptions and recommendation received from health professionals (adjusted OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0, p = 0.005). The uptake of fecal occult blood test was nearly the same (19%) for both genders. Further interaction analyses indicates that the effect of a family history of cancer on the uptake of a FS/colonoscopy is significantly weaker in males than in females (the interaction odds ratio = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8, p = 0.011), whereas a male perceived that visiting a doctor is good for health will be more likely to have an uptake of a FS/colonoscopy than a female with such perception (the interaction odds ratio = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.1-3.8, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of CRC tests was low in this average-risk population. More effort is needed to educate the public about the importance and benefits of CRC tests. In view of the gender differences in some determinants of FS/colonoscopy uptake, particular attention should be given to develop gender-specific strategies to improve the rate.
