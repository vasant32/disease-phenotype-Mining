This is the first case report describing transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with docetaxel-loaded microspheres which was successful in controlling liver metastases. We report on a 50-year-old woman with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Since November 2007, the patient had received 12 courses of mFOLFOX6 (LV/5-FU/L-OHP) as the 1st line therapy, 18 courses of LV/5-FU as the 2nd line therapy, 16 courses of FOLFIRI (LV/5-FU/CPT-11) + bevacizumab as the 3rd line therapy, and 32 courses of cetuximab as the 4th line therapy. All treatments had been conducted after confirmation of the disease progression. The patient experienced hepatic dysfunction, upper abdominal pain and malaise due to the growth of metastatic liver tumors. Since December 2009, the patient received 3 courses of TACE with docetaxel-loaded microspheres in combination with hepatic arterial infusion of 20 mg cisplatin (CDDP) in a palliative setting for the treatment of liver metastases, which resulted in a reduction or necrosis of liver metastases and improvement in hepatic function and symptoms. TACE with docetaxel-loaded microspheres may be a palliative therapy for patients with colorectal cancer who are refractory to the current standard systemic chemotherapy and have predominant liver metastases.
