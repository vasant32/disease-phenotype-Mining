The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene has been shown to be involved in genetic instability and to be downregluated in several human carcinomas. The chromosome locus of APC, 5q21-22, is frequently deleted in colorectal cancers (CRCs). The functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large amount of clinical samples. Case-matched tissues of CRC and adjacent normal epithelium (n = 134) were included in this study. Quantitative PCR was carried out to examine the copy number as well as mRNA expression of APC gene in colorectal malignancies. Our results showed that copy number deletions of APC were present in a relatively high percentage of colorectal cancer samples (26.1%, 35 out of 134). There was a positive correlation between copy number decrease of APC and tumor progression in CRCs. Furthermore, copy number loss of APC was correlated with decreased mRNA expression. However, mRNA levels of APC were also impaired in CRC samples with unaltered copy numbers, indicating that sporadic CRCs exhibit different mechanisms of APC regulation.
