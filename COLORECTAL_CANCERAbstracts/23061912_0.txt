Data from literature suggest the possible use of probiotics as chemopreventive agents against colon cancer, but few investigations are available on their effects on gastric cancer proliferation. In our previous study, a specific Lactobacillus, strain L. paracasei IMPC2.1, was demonstrated to colonize the human gut and positively affect fecal bacteria and biochemical parameters. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of L. paracasei IMPC2.1, comparing them with those of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (L.GG), either as viable or heat-killed cells, on cell proliferation and apoptosis in a gastric cancer (HGC-27) and a colorectal cancer cell line (DLD-1). Both the gastric and colon cancer cells were sensitive to the growth inhibition and apoptosis induction by both viable or heat-killed cells from L. paracasei IMPC2.1 and L.GG. These findings suggest the possibility for a food supplement, based on dead probiotics, including L. paracasei IMPC2.1 cells, which could represent an effective component of a functional food strategy for cancer growth inhibition, with potential for cancer prevention.
