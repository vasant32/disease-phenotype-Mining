Background:Ex vivo colospheres have been previously characterised as a colorectal cancer (CRC) well-rounded multicellular model, exclusively formed by carcinoma cells, and derived from fresh CRC tissue after mechanical dissociation. The ability to form colospheres was correlated with tumour aggressiveness. Their three-dimensional conformation prompted us to further investigate their potential interest as a preclinical cancer tool.Methods:Patient-derived CRC xenografts were used to produce numerous colospheres. Mechanism of formation was elucidated by confocal microscopy. Expression analysis of a panel of 64 selected cancer-related genes by real-time qRT-PCR and hierarchical clustering allowed comparison of colospheres with parent xenografts. In vitro and in vivo assays were performed for migration and chemosensitivity studies.Results:Colospheres, formed by tissue remodelling and compaction, remained viable several weeks in floating conditions, escaping anoikis through their strong cell-cell interactions. Colospheres matched the gene expression profile of the parent xenograft tissue. Colosphere-forming cells migrated in collagen I matrix and metastasised when subrenally implanted in nude mice. Besides, the colosphere responses to 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan, two standard drugs in CRC, reproduced those of the in vivo original xenografts.Conclusion:Colospheres closely mimic biological characteristics of in vivo CRC tumours. Consequently, they would be relevant ex vivo CRC models.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 28 March 2013; doi:10.1038/bjc.2013.132 www.bjcancer.com.
