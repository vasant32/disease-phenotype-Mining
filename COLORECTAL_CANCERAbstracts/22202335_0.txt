Only a few reports have suggested the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy including oxaliplatin based regimens following surgical resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Since an administration of mFOLFOX6 was approved to medical insurance for advanced colorectal cancer as adjuvant chemotherapy, we applied mFOLFOX6 treatment (6 to 12 courses) to the patients who underwent curative resection of colorectal liver metastasis. The subjects were 14 patients who underwent curative resection for synchronous or metachronous colorectal liver metastasis and received mFOLFOX6 treatment postoperatively from January 2006 to January 2011. We retrospectively analyzed the patient's characteristics, relapse free survival, overall survival, and adverse events in these patients. Synchronous liver metastasis was found in 5 patients, while metachronous liver metastasis was observed in 9 patients. There were no significant differences between these patients in terms of clinical characteristics, the relapse free survival and overall survival. All patients had some adverse events including bone-marrow suppression and diarrhea. Especially, grade 3 or higher bone-marrow suppression were recognized in 6 patients (42.8%). Neurologic toxicity (â‰¤ grade 2) was observed in 10 patients (71.4%). Adjuvant chemotherapy with mFOLFOX6 treatment following surgical resection of synchronous or metachronous liver metastasis was safely administered. We will further examine the benefit of mFOLFOX6 treatment for the patients who undergo a surgical resection of liver metastasis in the future.
