 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic value of self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) for resectable obstructing left-sided colon cancer or rectal cancer. METHODS: Clinical data of 73 patients who had acute obstruction due to left-sided colon cancer or rectal cancer during May 2007 to January 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into 2 groups: SEMS group (34 cases) underwent surgical resection after insertion of SEMS; emergency surgery group (39 cases) underwent emergency operation. The 2 group patients were compared for the incidence of primary anastomosis, stoma rate, laparoscopic surgery rate, mortality, postoperative morbidity, ICU admission rate, length of ICU stay, hospital stay, and hospitalization costs. RESULTS: The incidence of primary anastomosis in SEMS group was significantly higher than that in emergency surgery group (97.1% vs. 56.4%, χ(2) = 16.256, P < 0.001), and the protective stoma rate and permanent stoma rate in SEMS group were both lower than those in emergency surgery group (33.3% vs. 86.3%, 2.9% vs. 43.6%, χ(2) value were 14.972 and 16.156, both P < 0.001). Patients in SEMS group underwent significantly more laparoscopic surgery than in emergency surgery group (47.1% vs. 0, χ(2) = 23.505, P < 0.001). There were no significant difference in postoperative mortality (2.9% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.364). The postoperative morbidity in SEMS group was significantly lower than that in emergency surgery group (35.3% vs. 66.7%, P = 0.007). Incisional infection was the most common complication in both groups, and the incidence of which seemed to be more higher in emergency surgery group (17.6% vs. 38.5%, χ(2) = 3.840, P = 0.050). There was a lower ICU admission rate in SEMS group (24.2% vs. 53.9%, χ(2) = 6.972, P = 0.008), and the mean length of ICU stay and hospital stay were both shorter in SEMS group ((69.5 ± 7.4) hours vs. (114.3 ± 10.9) hours, t = -20.23, P < 0.001; (19.6 ± 4.8) days vs. (23.4 ± 6.2) days, t = -2.90, P = 0.005). The cost of hospitalization was less in SEMS group (45 383 ± 15 648 vs. 61 485 ± 20 380, t = -3.74, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SEMS can effectively relieve the large intestinal obstruction caused by left-sided colon cancer or rectal cancer, and change the traditional emergency surgery into a selective surgery with better outcomes. SEMS appears to be a valuable technique for resectable obstructing left-sided colorectal cancer.
