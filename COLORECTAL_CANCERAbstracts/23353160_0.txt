 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of preoperative platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) on the prognosis in patients with operable colorectal cancer. METHODS: The clinical data of 140 patients with operable colorectal cancer were analyzed retrospectively. According to preoperative PLR, the patients were divided into low PLR group (PLR<250) and high PLR group (PLRâ‰¥250). The overall 5-year survival rates and the clinicopathological factors in the two groups were analyzed using univariate analysis and COX regression model. RESULTS: The patients with a high PLR had a significantly lower overall 5-year survival rate than those with a low PLR (71.4% vs 51.5%, P=0.045). Univariate analyses identified tumor location, the depth of tumor invasion, lymph nodes metastasis, TMN stage, and PLR as significant risk factors for reduced overall 5-year survival. In COX regression model, a high PLR was identified as an independent risk factor for poorer prognosis in patients with resectable colorectal cancer (RR: 2.213; 95%CI: 1.007-4.863, P=0.0048). CONCLUSION: Preoperative PLR can be a clinically significant factor for assessment of prognosis of resectable colorectal cancer.
