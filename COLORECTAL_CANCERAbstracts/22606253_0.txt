 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most incident cancer and cause of cancer-related death in the United States. MicroRNAs, a class of small non-coding RNAs, have been implicated in the pathogenesis and prognosis of colorectal cancer, although few studies have examined the relationship between germline mutation in the microRNAs with risk and prognosis. We therefore investigated the association between a SNP in hsa-mir-608, which lies within the 10q24 locus, and colorectal cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort consisting of 245 cases and 446 controls was genotyped for rs4919510. The frequency of the GG genotype was significantly higher in African Americans (15%) compared to Caucasians (3%) controls. There was no significant association between rs4919510 and colorectal cancer risk (African American: OR(GG vs. CC) 0.89 [95% CI, 0.41-1.80]) (Caucasian: OR(GG vs. CC) 1.76, ([95% CI, 0.48-6.39]). However, we did observe an association with survival. The GG genotype was associated with an increased risk of death in Caucasians (HR(GG vs. CC) 3.54 ([95% CI, 1.38-9.12]) and with a reduced risk of death in African Americans (HR(GG vs. CC) 0.36 ([95% CI 0.12-1.07). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that rs4910510 may be associated with colorectal cancer survival in a manner that is dependent on race.
