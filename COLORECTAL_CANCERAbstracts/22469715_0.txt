 BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies regarding the risk for colorectal neoplasms in women with a prior diagnosis of gynecological cancer have revealed conflicting results. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study to quantify the risk for colorectal neoplasms in patients with gynecological cancers. METHODOLOGY: A total of 4613 women (including 27, 51 and 92 women with a prior diagnosis of endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers, respectively) >20 years of age were recruited prospectively from 9 tertiary medical centers in Korea between January 2008 and February 2009. All participants underwent complete colonoscopies for vague abdominal signs or symptoms or for colorectal cancer screening. Several risk factors for colorectal neoplasms and a prior history of gynecological cancer were compared between women with and without colorectal neoplasms. RESULTS: The risk for colorectal neoplasms was only elevated among women with previous endometrial cancer, but with ovarian or cervical cancer, particularly when diagnosed at <50 years of age (adjusted OR=3.7; 95% CI=1.0-13.3, p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a higher risk for colorectal neoplasms in women with previous endometrial cancer, particularly when diagnosed at <50 years of age. Greater emphasis on colorectal cancer screening in this population may be necessary.
