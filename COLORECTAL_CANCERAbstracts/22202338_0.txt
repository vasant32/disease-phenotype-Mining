We analyzed the clinical significance of hepatic lymph node metastasis in 48 patients who underwent a resection of colorectal liver metastases with hepatic lymph node (HN) dissection from 2001 to 2010. The frequency and the site of HN metastasis were investigated to clarify the relationship between clinical background and the significance of HN metastasis. In the frequency of HN metastases, positive lymph node metastases were detected in three (9.1%) out of 33 cases with synchronous liver metastasis and in one (6.7%) out of 15 cases with metachronous liver metastasis. In the site of HN metastasis, No. 8a and No. 12a lymph node metastasis was observed in one case each. No. 12b lymph node metastasis was seen in two cases. These cases with the presence of HN metastasis recurred within 13 months. On multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards models, hepatic lymph node metastases was an independent risk factor for overall survival (hazard ratio (95% CI): 4.165 (1.018-17.044), p=0.04). Our results indicated that HN metastases in colorectal liver metastases were a poor prognostic factor. Based on the results, we will examine the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for the patients with HN metastases in the future.
