 BACKGROUND: A recent genome-wide association study has identified a new genetic variant rs7758229 in SLC22A3 for colorectal cancer susceptibility in a Japanese population, but it is unknown whether this newly identified variant is associated with colorectal cancer in other populations, including the Chinese population. METHODS: We examined the associations between rs7758229 and colorectal cancer risk among 1,147 cases and 1,203 controls matched by age and sex. Logistic regression model was used to assess the associations. RESULTS: No significant association was found between rs7758229 and colorectal cancer risk (OR = 0.95, 95%CI  = 0.84-1.09, P = 0.463). Similar results were observed in the stratification of tumor location (OR  = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.80-1.11, P = 0.481 for colon cancer, and OR  = 0.96, 95%CI  = 0.82-1.13, P = 0.621 for rectum cancer). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not support an association between rs7758229 in 6q26-q27 and the risk of colorectal cancer in a Chinese population.
