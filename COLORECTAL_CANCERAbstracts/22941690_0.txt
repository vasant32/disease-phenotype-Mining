 OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection on the peritoneal microstructure injury and expression of t-PA/PAI-1 molecules. METHODS: A total of 50 patients with colorectal cancer were prospectively enrolled between June 2011 and February 2012 in the Shanxi Provincial Hospital and were assigned into laparoscopic group (LO, n=27) and conventional laparotomy group (CO, n=23) based on patients expectancy and surgeon decision. Optical microscope and scanning electron microscope were employed for comparison of the postoperative peritoneal injury between LO and CO. Before and after surgery, t-PA and PAI-1 of peritoneal tissue were determined by ELISA in both groups. RESULTS: Optical microscope and scanning electronic microscopy scan indicated less serosal injury in LO group than that in CO group with regard to serosa integrity, continuity of covering adipocytes and mesothelial cells, and the aggregation level of inflammatory cells (P<0.01). The injury score was 38.22 in CO in and 14.67 in LO and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01). No significant differences were found between LO and CO in terms of postoperative t-PA in the omentum, t-PA and PAI-1 in the intestinal serosa tissue (P>0.05), however PAI-1 in the omentum was significantly lower in LO group compared to CO group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer causes less peritoneal structural injury and less influence on the fibrinolytic capacity, which may contribute to less postoperative adhesion.
