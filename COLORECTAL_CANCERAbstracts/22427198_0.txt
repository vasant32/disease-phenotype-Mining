The recent identification of HER2 gene amplification as a novel predictor             of resistance to the EGFR (HER2)-targeted antibody cetuximab and of response to             combination therapies against EGFR and HER2 in wild-type KRAS tumor settings may             represent a further step toward personalized medicine for patients with colorectal             cancer. Herein, we show that transcriptional upregulation of HER2 expression in             the absence of HER2 gene amplification is a molecular phenomenon that takes place             in EGFR-dependent, wild-type KRAS squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells that acquire             resistance to cetuximab. Since cetuximab activity against cetuximab-refractory             SCC cells can be fully restored in the presence of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody             trastuzumab, our findings suggest that, beyond HER2 gene amplification, we might             need to redefine the threshold values for HER2 positivity to improve the accuracy             of the selection of cetuximab-refractory patients with wild-type KRAS that may             benefit from receiving a cetuximab/trastuzumab combination.
