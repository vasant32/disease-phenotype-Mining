Though colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in Denmark, there is a serious lack of knowledge in general practice about symptom presentation. The prevalence and the positive predictive value of the so-called alarm symptoms are vague, and screening will only detect a small number of cancers per year. In the future, general practice will still play an important role in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer; therefore, knowledge about how the disease presents in general practice is urgently needed, and intervention studies on how to optimize early diagnosis should be encouraged.
