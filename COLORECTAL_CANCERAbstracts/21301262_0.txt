The American Cancer Society estimated that 152,260 people would be diagnosed with, and 50,630 people would die of, colorectal cancer in 2009. It recommends that screening for average-risk adults should start at the age of 50 years; however, less than half have been screened according to the guidelines. Colorectal cancer can be prevented by diet and lifestyle, in addition to polypectomy, and the morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early intervention. The purpose of this replication study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a health belief model-based colorectal cancer education session to increase awareness of the need for prevention and screening and to promote such discussions between the participants and their doctors. Participants attended education sessions at three agencies in the Midwest. Participants' beliefs, before and after the sessions, were evaluated by survey. The results support that the education sessions were successful in increasing awareness of the need for a healthy lifestyle and adhering to the screening guidelines. A longitudinal study would help to track awareness over time and evaluate the efficacy toward long-term healthy lifestyles.
