Colorectal carcinoma in pediatric population is relatively rare (<1% of all cancers in first two decades) and behaves aggressively as compared with the same in adult population. We report a case of 11-year-old adolescent male, who presented with pain abdomen and melena. Fine-needle aspiration cytology from the growth in rectum revealed mucinous adenocarcinomas, which was later confirmed on histopathology. The patient also had positive peritoneal fluid cytology.
