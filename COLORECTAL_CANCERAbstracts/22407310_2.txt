MicroRNAs are a class of â‰ˆ22-nt noncoding single-strand RNAs regulating gene expression postscriptionally. Metastasis caused poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients and half of the patients developed metastatic lesions when admission. Here we investigated the possible roles of microRNAs in regulating metastasis in the paired colon cancer cells SW480 and SW620. Among those dysregulated microRNAs, miR-200c was speculated to inhibit metastasis by targeting ZEB1. Overexpression of miR-200c was concurrent with downregulation of ZEB1 mRNA and protein. Functional assays demonstrated that modulation of miR-200c with mimics or inhibitors changed potential of metastasis in SW480/620 cancer cells in vitro. Taken together, our study demonstrated that miR-200c inhibits metastatic ability by targeting ZEB1 in colon cancer cells SW480/620 and suggested that modulation of miR-200c could serve as therapeutic tool for inhibiting metastasis in colorectal cancer.
