The metastatic spread of tumor cells is one of the most common causes of mortality in cancer patients. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the formation of metastatic colonies has been one of the major objectives of cancer research. Organ-specific colonization of cancer cells is a significant and noteworthy feature of metastasis. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality. The liver is commonly the sole site of metastasis for CRC and represents a major cause of mortality in CRC patients. However, what regulates CRC cell metastasis into liver and the reasons for the liver-specific metastasis of CRC have yet to be adequately elucidated. Recent progress provides indications and a conceptual framework with which to investigate this issue. This review evaluated experimental and clinical evidence to support a mechanistic role for circulation patterns and microvessels in liver, metastasis-related genes, chemokines and their receptors, and cellular adhesion molecules in the process of CRC liver metastasis.
