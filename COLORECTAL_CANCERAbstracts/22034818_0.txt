Clinical application of staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) was restricted during the cure of malignant tumor due to its side-effects. The aim of this study was to obtain SEC2 mutant, preserving the important functional sites responsible for the T-cell stimulatory activities but removing the sites responsible for emetic activity, through truncation of SEC2. It would efficiently solve the question of SEC2 side-effect. According to the results of methyl thiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay in vitro, novel truncated SEC2 mutant (NSM) efficiently stimulated T-cell proliferation and inhibited the growth of such tumor cells as human colorectal cancer cells (Cx-1) and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) in vitro. Activities of T cell stimulating and anti-tumor of NSM were similar to those of SEC2. According to results of animal experiments, the mutant no longer induced emetic response even if the dose was a 10-fold excess of the amount of SEC2 required. And also, NSM obviously inhibited the tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Therefore, we obtained novel truncated staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 mutant, which could efficiently inhibit the growth of tumor cells. It will become novel anti-tumor agents with the lowest side-effects and best treatment effects in clinic.
