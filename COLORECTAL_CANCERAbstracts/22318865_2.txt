Colorectal cancers (CRC) express the WNT effector protein Î²-catenin in a heterogeneous subcellular pattern rather than uniformly in the nucleus. In this study, we investigated this important aspect of molecular heterogeneity in CRCs by analyzing its basis and relationship with tumor-initiating capability. CRC cells with the highest WNT levels showed only a marginal increase in tumor initiation capacity. Notably, high WNT activity correlated with a coincident activation of robust mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, which when upregulated by KRAS expression or downregulated by epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition elicited parallel effects on WNT activity. These findings suggested that on its own high WNT activity may not be a reliable signifier of tumor-initiating potential or stem-like potential. Furthermore, they suggest that MAPK signaling is a critical modifier of intratumoral heterogeneity that contributes significantly to determining the impact of WNT activity on stemness phenotypes in colon cancer cells.
