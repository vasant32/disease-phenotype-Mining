 BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the predominant angiogenic factor. Recently, there was a consistent trend of poorer survival rates in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients of earlier relapse. The purpose of this study was to investigate novel predictors of early relapse in stage I-III CRC and further to determine their correlation with disease outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinicopathological features and VEGF expression by immunohistochemical staining in 100 stage I-III CRC patients undergoing curative resection to identify predictors of postoperative early relapse. RESULTS: Among 100 patients, 40 patients were classified into early relapse group, and 60 patients were categorized into non-early relapse group. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that vascular invasion (P = 0.048), perineural invasion (P = 0.042), VEGF overexpression (P = 0.023), and high postoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (P = 0.004) were independent predictors of early relapse. Additionally, we found that with more predictors such as the combined incidence of vascular invasion, perineural invasion, VEGF overexpression, and postoperative CEA levels are involved, the incidence of early postoperative relapse increases. Moreover, VEGF overexpression predicted not only early postoperative relapse but also disease-free survival (P < 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that VEGF overexpression is an important predictor of early postoperative relapse in patients with stage I-III CRC and may help identify patients who would benefit from intensive follow-up and therapeutic programs.
