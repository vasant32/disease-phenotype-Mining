The aim of the study is to analyse gene typing with the use of the microarray technique (HG-U133A, Affymetrix), differentiating colorectal cancer tissues from tissues assessed histopathologically as healthy ones among a panel of 93 mRNA of gene encoding proteins involved in the activation of cellular signal transduction pathways by insulin-like growth factors. The study was conducted on a group of 8 colorectal cancer patients. Frozen tumor and healthy specimens from the patients were used in molecular tests. Transcript IGF2 differentiated cancer from healthy tissue. Among the genes participating in the cascade of signal transfer in cells activated by IGF, GRB10, PIK3R3, PIK3R1, and IRS1 were qualified as differentiating transcripts. IRS1 indicated over-expression in tumour. Transcript SMAD2 showed a significant changed in tumour samples (increased expression).
