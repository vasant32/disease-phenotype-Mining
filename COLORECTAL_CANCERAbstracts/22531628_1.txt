 BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is commonly used in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, but to date, despite extensive research, no predictive or prognostic biomarkers for bevacizumab have been identified. The development of bevacizumab-induced arterial hypertension has recently been suggested as a potential predictive biomarker. METHODS: Blood pressure was recorded during the BOXER study, a phase II study of capecitabine, oxaliplatin (CAPOX) plus bevacizumab as peri-operative treatment in 45 patients with poor-risk colorectal liver-only metastases unsuitable for upfront resection. In this analysis, the development of bevacizumab-induced hypertension was correlated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of patients developed â‰¥grade 1 hypertension while receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 4% developed grade 3 hypertension. There was no correlation between the development of hypertension and radiological response rate (P=0.642), progression-free survival (P=0.644) or overall survival (P=0.480) in those who developed hypertension compared with those who did not. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab-induced hypertension did not predict radiological response or survival in our study. The results highlight a number of important issues regarding the use of hypertension as a biomarker.
