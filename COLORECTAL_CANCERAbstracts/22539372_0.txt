Chyle leak is a rare complication after abdominal surgery. According to the statistical results from our center, we summarized the experiences in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of abdominal chyle leak after radical resection of colorectal cancer. Early prevention, early diagnosis, and early treatment may result in earlier recovery, shorter hospital stay, lower incidence, and better prognosis.
