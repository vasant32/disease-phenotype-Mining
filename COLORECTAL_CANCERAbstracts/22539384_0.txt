 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatectomy combined with cryoablation and ethanol injection in patients with unresectable multiple liver metastases from colorectal cancer. METHODS: Clinical data of 23 patients with multiple liver metastases form colorectal cancer in the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College between January 2005 and December 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 15 males and 8 females with average age of 52.2 years. All the patients underwent hepatectomy combined with ultrasound-guided cryoablation and ethanol injection intraoperatively. RESULTS: Among 98 lesions in 23 patients, 45 were removed intraoperatively and 53 were treated by cryoablation and ethanol injection. Operative time for liver lesions ranged from 27 to 96 minutes and intraoperative blood loss 50 to 450 ml. One patient developed pleural effusion and 1 myoglobinuria after operation. All the patients were followed up with a median follow-up time of 34 months(8 to 70 months). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 83.2%, 45.5% and 37.6% respectively. CONCLUSION: Hepatectomy combined with cryoablation and ethanol injection is an effective and safe treatment option for patients with unresectable multiple liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
