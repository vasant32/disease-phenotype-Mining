 PURPOSE: To explore patient satisfaction on different aspects of follow-up service provision following treatment for colorectal cancer and amenability to an alternative strategy for follow-up care. METHODS AND SAMPLE: A postal survey was administered to 297 eligible patients who had been treated for colorectal cancer at a large hospital in the North West of England. Patients were asked to indicate responses to questions comprising likert scales, including views on organisation of care, information and advice, personal experience of care, satisfaction with information and care, views on specialist nursing services and amenability to telephone follow-up. KEY RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven completed surveys were returned (62.97% response rate). Analysis of scale data indicated high levels of satisfaction on all outcome measures but sub-optimal rates of satisfaction on some items. Respondents indicated high levels of satisfaction with information related to disease and treatment but lower levels of satisfaction for items related to genetic risk, sexual attractiveness and self care. Colorectal nurse specialists were highly rated, especially in terms of information provision and personal experience of care. Patients were generally amenable to telephone follow-up, although male patients indicated higher levels of willingness to accept this approach than females. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with traditional medical based follow-up is generally high in this patient cohort but there is room for improvement in terms of service delivery. High levels of satisfaction with the care delivered by colorectal nurse specialists and patient acceptance of telephone follow-up suggests nurse-led telephone follow-up is a viable alternative to traditional hospital based follow-up.
