Since the approval of bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab, development of novel molecular-targeted agents for colorectal cancer has been awaited. Recent phase III trials revealed that new molecular-target agents, regorafenib and aflibercept, are useful for previously treated mCRC. Regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor which targets angiogenic, stromal and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase(RTK). Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein that consists of vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)-binding portions from the extracellular domains of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2, fused to the Fc portion of the human IgG1 immunoglobulin. They are different in structure, but an anti-angiogenic effect is one of the main mechanisms of action they have in common. Consistent with the 18147ML study, bevacizumab beyond progression (BBP), anti-angiogenic therapies are important in any line of chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.
