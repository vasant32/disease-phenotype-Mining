 AIM: Polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene may be a risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated the association of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VDR gene with CRC in age and gender matched patients and controls of European origin in New Zealand. METHOD: CRC (N=200) and healthy control (N=200) samples were genotyped for the Fok1 (rs2228570), Taq1 (rs731236) and Cdx2 (rs11568820) polymorphisms using TaqmanÂ® SNP genotyping assays. Chi-squared analysis was used to test for overall association of VDR genotype with disease, and by age and gender subgroups. RESULTS: There were no significant associations of the three VDR SNPs with disease either by allelic frequencies (p=0.43-0.73) or genotypic distribution (p=0.15-0.90). Furthermore, no significant differences for allelic frequencies of the three SNPs were revealed in subgroup analysis by age (above/below median age of 72 yrs; p=0.38-0.91), gender (p=0.22-0.88), or age/gender (p=0.33-0.93) CONCLUSION: We found no evidence to suggest that the VDR SNPs Fok1, Taq1 and Cdx2 influence CRC risk in New Zealand Europeans.
