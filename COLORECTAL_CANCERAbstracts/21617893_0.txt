 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the added value of pre- and intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound (transabdominal, or TCEUS and intraoperative, or ICEUS, respectively) in patients with known or highly suspected colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) who have previously undergone extensive gadobenate dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA) liver MRI. METHODS: Fifteen patients with a total of 31 lesions were included in the comparison of TCEUS vs. MRI and nine patients with a total of 19 lesions were included in the comparison of ICEUS vs. MRI. MRI examinations were performed before TCEUS and ICEUS. The analysis was performed lesion by lesion. Sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and accuracy were calculated and compared. RESULTS: On comparing TCEUS with MRI, sensitivity differed significantly, with values of 87% and 100%, respectively (p value < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in PPV and accuracy. The comparison of ICEUS with MRI, however, showed no significant difference in sensitivity, PPV or accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Transabdominal and intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound have no added value in the preoperative evaluation of patients with CRLM undergoing extensive gadobenate dimeglumine liver MRI.
