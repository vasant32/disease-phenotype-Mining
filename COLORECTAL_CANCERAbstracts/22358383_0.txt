 PURPOSE: The primary aim was to respectively evaluate PLA2G4A mutants modifying protective effect of tea consumption against colorectal cancer (CRC), colon and rectal cancer. METHODS: All participants were recruited from January 2006 to April 2008. The information about tea consumption was collected by a structured questionnaire. CRC patients were diagnosed based on histology. Four single-nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) in PLA2G4A gene were selected. Multiple logistic regression models were used for assessing the joint effects between tea consumption and SNPs on CRC, colon and rectal cancer. RESULTS: Three hundred patients with CRC and 296 controls well-matched were used in the final analyses. The significant individual associations between four SNPs (rs6666834, rs10911933, rs4650708 and rs7526089) and CRC were not observed. However, their CTAC haplotype was significantly associated with the increased risk of CRC (OR = 3.06; 95%CI = 1.52-6.19), compared with TCAC haplotype. Drinking tea was correlated with a decreased risk of CRC after adjustment for covariates (OR = 0.61; 95%CI = 0.39-0.97). Meanwhile, compared with no-tea drinkers with TT/CT genotype of rs6666834, tea drinkers with TT/CT or CC had significant lower risk of CRC (OR = 0.6, 95%CI = 0.36-1.00 for TT/CT; 0.38, 0.19-0.74 for CC). The joint effects between the remaining three SNPs and drinking tea on CRC were observed as well. Similar findings were observed on colon and rectal cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Tea consumption and haplotype of mutants in PLA2G4A gene were respectively associated with the risk of CRC. PLA2G4A mutants modified the protective effect of tea consumption against CRC, colon and rectal cancers in Chinese population.
