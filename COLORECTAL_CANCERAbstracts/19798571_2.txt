 PURPOSE: Human TIP30 was initially identified as a candidate metastasis suppressor gene whose expression was down-regulated in human liver, lung, breast, and prostate cancers, and recently the role of this gene was examined in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the level of TIP30 expression in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). RESULTS: TIP30 protein levels were lower in colorectal carcinomas compared to normal tissue from the control group (P < 0.001). The frequencies of hypermethylation of TIP30 in tumor were 36%, while there was no aberrant methylation in paired adjacent non-tumor tissue. A statistically significant inverse association was found between TIP30 methylation status and expression of the TIP30 protein in tumor tissues (P = 0.006). Somatic missense mutations in the TIP30 gene were identified in human CRC tissue specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that promoter methylation is involved in the decreased expression of TIP30 tumor suppressor gene in human colorectal carcinoma.
