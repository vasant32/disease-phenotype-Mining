Colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rates have decreased in the general US population; however, CRC mortality rates are increasing among American Indians (AI). AI CRC screening rates remain low when compared to other ethnic groups. Our team investigated CRC screening education prior to recommended age for screening to better understand screening perceptions among AI community members. Our research team conducted 11 focus groups with AI men and women aged 30-49 (N = 39 men and N = 31 women) in Kansas and Missouri. The results revealed that community members (1) have little knowledge of CRC, (2) do not openly discuss CRC, and (3) want additional CRC education. Variations existed among men and women's groups, but they agreed that preventive measures need to be appropriate for AI communities. Thus, AI CRC screening interventions should be culturally tailored to better meet the needs of the population.
