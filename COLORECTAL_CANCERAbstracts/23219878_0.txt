Colitis is the term used for chronic inflammatory bowel diseases at substantially increased risk of developing a form of colorectal cancer (CRC) known as colitis-associated cancer. In our study we synthesized core-shell polymeric micelles obtained by self-assembly of block copolymers for high efficiency delivery of anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer compounds to colonocytes and colon mucosa. We achieved an efficient intracellular delivery of these hydrophobic compounds (prednisone, retinoic acid and doxorubicin) to cultured colonocytes without cellular toxicity. The efficacy of retinoic acid and doxorubicin administration was significantly increased using these nanosized carriers. Moreover, these polymeric micelles have been shown to overcome the multidrug resistance efflux mechanism effectively delivering doxorubicin to multidrug-resistant colon cancer cells. These nanocarriers are also suitable for selective in vivo delivery of lipophilic drugs by enema administration to the inflamed colon tissue, specifically targeting the inflamed mucosa.
