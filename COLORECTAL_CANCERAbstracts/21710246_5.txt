Colorectal cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer and is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Published data on the association between CYP1A1 (MspI and Ile                         (                            462                         )                         Val) polymorphisms and colorectal cancer risk are inconclusive. To address these issues, we carried out a meta-analysis of available case-control study. Online electronic searches of PubMed were performed. We identified 17 studies (6,673 colorectal cancer patients and 8,102 control subjects) that examined the association between CYP1A1 (MspI and Ile                         (                            462                         )                         Val) polymorphisms and risk of colorectal cancer. For CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism, we performed a meta-analysis from 13 studies including 5,468 cases and 6,492 controls. Overall, there was no statistically significant association between CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism and colorectal cancer susceptibility. In the subgroup analyses based on ethnicities, no statistically significant associations were observed in all genetic models. With respect to CYP1A1 Ile                         (                            462                         )                         Val polymorphism, a total of 14 studies including 6,654 cases and 7,859 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. The CYP1A1 Ile                         (                            462                         )                         Val polymorphism was associated with risk of colorectal cancer. Ethnic subgroup analyses revealed that significant associations were found in Asians and Caucasians. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that CYP1A1 Ile                         (                            462                         )                         Val polymorphism was a low-penetrance susceptibility gene in colorectal cancer development. On the contrary, CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism does not seem capable of modifying colorectal cancer risk.
