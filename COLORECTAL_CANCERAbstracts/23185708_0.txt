Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology. Most patients with CD will eventually develop a stricturing or penetrating complication. Colonoscopic findings may predict the clinical course in patients with CD. Moreover, since CD patients are at increased risk for developing dysplasia and colorectal cancer, surveillance colonoscopy is necessary for the detection of malignancies. We describe here a CD patient with a high-grade anorectal stricture who successfully underwent a total colon examination with an ultra-slim upper endoscope after an insertion failure with a standard colonoscope and gastroscope.
