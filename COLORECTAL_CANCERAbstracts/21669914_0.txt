 OBJECTIVE: Biological levels of localized colon tumors are needed for the diagnosis and prevention of colon cancer. Numerous biomarker studies are produced currently through research. We investigated some peptides with the aim of identifying biomarkers for colorectal cancer and lymphatic and hepatic metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients with histologically proven colorectal cancer and 60 normal volunteers were included in this study. Preoperative serum was collected for analysis. Human neutrophil peptides levels (HNP) were assayed by solid phase RIA (Radio Immun Assay) based on monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The HNP-1, -2 and -3-also known as Î±-defensin-1, -2 and -3-are present in elevated concentrations in the plasma from colorectal cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Preoperative high plasma HNP 1-3 levels are associated with colorectal cancer. The HNP 1-3 levels may procure information on patients with lymph node or hepatic metastasis.
