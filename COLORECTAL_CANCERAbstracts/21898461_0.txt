In contrast to colonoscopy biopsy, which contains several disadvantages such as bleeding, sampling error, crush artifact, and time-consuming pathological procedure, multiphoton microscopy (MPM) enables direct noninvasive visualization of tissue architecture and cell morphology in live tissues without the administration of exogenous contrast agents. We performed a proof-of-principle study to evaluate the feasibility of using MPM to make real-time noninvasive optical diagnosis of colorectal cancer by investigating 30 fresh, unfixed, and unstained full-thickness colorectal specimens. We found that MPM images demonstrated irregular tubular structures, reduced stroma, and cellular and nuclear pleomorphism in the cancerous tissues. Cancer cells, characterized by irregular size and shape, enlarged nuclei, and increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio, were clearly observed in MPM images, which were comparable to golden standard hematoxylin-eosin staining images. Our findings showed that MPM had the potential to make real-time noninvasive optical diagnosis of colorectal cancer. With miniaturization and integration of colonoscopy, MPM has a promising future in real-time noninvasive "optical biopsy" for colorectal cancer.
