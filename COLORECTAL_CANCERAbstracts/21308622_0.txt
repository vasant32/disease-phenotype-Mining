 AIM: To evaluate and assess disruptions of serum lipids at patients having a colorectal cancer. METHODS: Our prospective study interested 30 patients, from 26 to 93 year old, presenting a colorectal cancer confirmed histologically, examined during the period going from March 2003 to April 2004. Thirty healthy controls were examined in parallel. All patients undergo three blood samples respectively in preoperative, 48h and 6 months after surgical operation. The analyses carried out were determination of a total serum cholesterol, HDL (high density lipoprot√©in) and LDL (low density lipoprotein) cholesterol, serum triglyceride and serum apoprotein (AI and B) RESULTS: We noticed a decrease of total serum cholesterol level in 43% of the cases associated to the reduction of the HDL and the LDL cholesterol in respectively 30% and 76% of cases. The mean values of total serum cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol rates were significantly lower for patients compared to those of controls (p respectively : 0.001; 0.04 and 0.001). Moreover, the level of total serum cholesterol varied significantly with tumor localization ( p= 0,02). CONCLUSION: Serum lipid disruptions affect essentially total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol. It would be therefore interesting to evaluate their rate at the basal state in order to follow their evolution after treatment in colorectal cancer.
