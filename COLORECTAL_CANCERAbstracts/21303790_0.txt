 OBJECTIVE: After approval of bevacizumab in Japan, post-marketing surveillance studies reported on safety. However, few reports have shown the efficacy of bevacizumab as used in daily practice. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer patients in daily practice. METHODS: All unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer patients who began receiving bevacizumab in participating facilities from June 2007 to October 2008 were retrospectively analyzed for safety and efficacy. Adverse events were assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors criteria, version 1.0, was used for the tumor response rate. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients from 17 institutions were assessed. Grade 3 or higher adverse events related to bevacizumab included gastrointestinal perforation in 3, thrombosis in 7, hypertension in 30 and gastrointestinal bleeding in 2. Response rates were 62.5, 30.1 and 11.8% overall among patients receiving bevacizumab as first-, second- and third-line or greater therapy. Median progression-free survival was 14.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 10.8-18.1], 7.8 (95% CI: 6.5-9.1) and 6.0 (95% CI: 4.6-7.3) months, and median overall survival was 32.5 (95% CI: 24.6-40.3), 16.4 (95% CI: 14.4-18.5) and 11.8 (95% CI: 8.6-15.0) months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The general cohort of patients in HGCSG0801 showed a similar efficacy and safety profile of bevacizumab as seen in clinical trials. Although the sample size was small and there were several study limitations, these results suggest that colorectal cancer patients in Japan might safely receive and benefit from bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in daily practice, as is seen in patients in other countries.
