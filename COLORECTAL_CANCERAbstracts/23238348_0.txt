 OBJECTIVES: Hispanic colorectal cancer (CRC) rates historically have been lower than for non-Hispanic Whites in the United States and in Florida. The aim of this study is to understand CRC trends in Florida Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, all invasive CRCs diagnosed among Florida residents between 1989 and 2006 were accessed from the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS). These cases were analyzed by Hispanic and non-Hispanic White ethnic identification. The Hispanic Origin Identification Algorithm was applied to the FCDS data to identify Hispanic subjects. Primary cancer site and histology data were organized according to SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results) categories. Joinpoint regression was used to generate incidence trends by stage and subsite location. RESULTS: Rates of CRC incidence were higher for Florida Hispanics compared with non-Hispanic Whites since the mid 1990s. There was a consistent significant increase in the incidence of distant stage CRC in Hispanics (annual percent change (APC) of 1.26 and 0.90 in males and females), whereas rates in non-Hispanics decreased significantly during the same time period (APC -1.36 and -1.28, respectively). Similar trends were found in distant-stage right-sided CRC. Among right-sided CRCs, local stage incidence rate increased for both non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics, whereas the incidence rate for regional stage decreased for both racial/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Trends for distant-stage CRC are increasing among Florida Hispanics. This is a particular public health concern given that CRC is a cancer for which screening modalities exist and could imply a concomitant increase in CRC-related mortality among Florida Hispanics. Lower rates of CRC screening in Hispanics are documented at the state level, relative to non-Hispanic Whites. Screening programs targeting the Florida Hispanic population are warranted.
