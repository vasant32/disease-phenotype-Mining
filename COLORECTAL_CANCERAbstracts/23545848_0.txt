Cancer stem cells play an important role in carcinogenesis and resistance to treatment and may lead to metastasis. The isolation of circulating stem cells involves cell sorting based on the presence of cell surface markers. Many surface markers such as CD133, c-Kit, SOX, OCT4 and TWIST have been reported. In the present study, we determined the expression of different stem cell markers and their variation in expression at different stages of the treatment process. Samples of EDTA blood were collected from metastatic colorectal cancer patients, and circulating cancer stem cells were isolated for the analysis of the expression of stem cell markers using RT-PCR. These findings were correlated with the response to therapy. All statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad PrismÂ 5.03 software. Significant differences were found in the expression levels of the markers CD133, SOX2, OCT4 and TWIST1. No differences were found in c-Kit expression. Correlation in the expression levels of most of the markers was observed. Expression of CD133, OCT4, SOX2 and TWIST1 had a predictive value for colon cancer behavior. Evaluation of this stem cell gene expression panel may be useful for predicting the response during the process of treatment, and the relative easy access to samples facilitates this method. Moreover the correlation between CD133 and TWIST1 expression may be associated with tumor regrowth and metastatic relapse.
