 BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether surgical approach and patient demographics are important factors that influence lymph node retrieval. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients receiving surgical treatment for colorectal cancer at a single institution. RESULTS: Two hundred three patients underwent resection for colorectal cancer. The total number of lymph nodes recovered and the number of lymph nodes involved were similar in both the laparoscopic group and the open group. Patients who had right-sided colon resection had a higher total number of lymph nodes recovered. There was no effect of age, sex, race, or body mass index (BMI) on the total number of lymph nodes harvested or on the number of positive lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate regional lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer can be successfully performed using a laparoscopic approach. Patient demographics did not make a difference in the number of total or positive lymph nodes recovered.
