 PURPOSE: More and more complications of extensive hepatic resection are being encountered in patients treated for liver metastases from colorectal cancer. This study aimed to determine the impact of liver abscess after hepatic resection on overall survival (OS) and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 252 patients treated by liver metastasectomy between 2001 and 2010. RESULTS: The 5-year survival rate was 55.8%. Twenty-one (8.3%) patients developed liver abscess after liver metastasectomy. Multivariate analysis identified the size of liver metastasis, surgical margin, and the presence of liver abscess as significant prognostic factors. Patients (whether or not they developed liver abscess after hepatic resection) had similar progression-free survival (median, 9.8 vs. 12.4 months, P = 0.476), but patients who developed liver abscess had significantly shorter OS (26.6 vs. 76.0 months, P = 0.004). Subsequent adjuvant therapy significantly improved OS in these patients (16.9 vs. 38.5 months, P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Liver abscess after liver metastasectomy is an independent prognostic factor, and adjuvant chemotherapy is warranted in those patients who develop liver abscess.
