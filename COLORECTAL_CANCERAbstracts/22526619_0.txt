Oroxylin A is a flavonoid found in the roots of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, a herbal medicine commonly used as an antipyretic, analgesic, antitumor, and anti-in&fllig;ammatory agent. It has recently been investigated for its anticancer activities in hepatoma, gastric, and breast tumors. Here, we investigated the antitumor effects of oroxylin A in human colon carcinoma HCT-116 cells in vitro and in vivo. We characterized the proapoptotic effect of oroxylin A using diamidino-phenyl-indole (DAPI) and annexin V/PI staining. We then found that both caspase-3 and caspase-9 were activated, the expression of Bcl-2 protein decreased, and the expression of Bax protein increased after treatment with oroxylin A. In addition, oroxylin A increased nuclear transcription factor erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression and induced Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus. Furthermore, we found that oroxylin A treatment elevated intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and increased the protein expression level of two of the Nrf2 target genes heme oxygenase-1 and NADP(H):quinone oxidoreductase-1 in HCT-116 cells. Finally, our study demonstrated that oral administration of oroxylin A significantly decreased tumor volume and weight in immunodeficient mice that were inoculated with HCT-116 cells. The in-vivo chemopreventive efficacy of oroxylin A against HCT-116 human colon cancer was accompanied by its proapoptotic and Nrf2-inducing activities, which correlates with the in-vitro study. This is the first demonstration of oroxylin A-dependent chemoprevention in colon cancer and may offer a potential mechanism for its anticancer action in vivo.
