Genes associated with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS genes) are several pivotal transcriptional factors, which are used to induce pluripotent stem cells from some adult somatic cells. The roles of these iPS genes and especially the signature for these iPS genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) are still unclear. Overexpressed Oct4 and Lin28 but down-regulated Nanog were found in tumor tissues compared with that in their paired normal counterparts of CRC patients. Interestingly, we found that Oct4, Lin28 and Nanog were highly overexpressed in some patients. And the signature for iPS genes was correlated with tumor site (P = 0.012), lymph node status (P = 0.033), Dukes classification (P = 0.033) of CRC patients. Moreover, an independent public expression profiling data showed signature for the four iPS genes could successfully be used to predict the survival of CRC patients with Dukes stages B and C. Immunofluorescent staining of fresh CRC tissues from patients showed that strong co-expressions of Oct4 and Nanog proteins or Sox2 and Lin28 were present in some CRC cells. Then, CRC cell subclone with four iPS genes overexpression were establish by a mixed retroviral system. We found that iPS genes promote sphere-formation, proliferation, colony formation, migration of human CRC cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Our study first shows the clinical significance of iPS signature in CRC patients.
