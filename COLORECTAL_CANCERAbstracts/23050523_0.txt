 PURPOSE: To develop and validate a quality of life (QOL) instrument for patients with colorectal cancer, QLICP-CR. METHODS: Using the programmed decision method and the theory in instrument development, the QLICP-CR was developed and evaluated based on the data measuring QOL thrice from a sample of 110 inpatients of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: The internal consistency Î± and the test-retest reliability for the overall scale and domains are above 0.70 and 0.79, respectively; the score differences between pretreatment and posttreatment have statistical significance for three domains and the overall instrument, with higher Standardized Response Mean of 0.61, 0.62, 1.33, and 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: The QLICP-CR is of good validity, reliability, and responsiveness.
