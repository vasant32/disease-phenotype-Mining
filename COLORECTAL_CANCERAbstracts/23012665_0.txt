 BACKGROUND: To ensure patient safety, rigorous quality assurance (QA) measures for colonoscopy were introduced for the Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) in England. The impact of these high QA measures on patient experience and satisfaction is unknown. AIMS: To determine the impact of this high-level QA of colonoscopy on patient satisfaction. METHODS: A case controlled study using a retrospective audit & telephone interview patient survey was performed between 1/1/07-01/10/08 on patients that underwent colonoscopy. Data were analyzed by comparing quantitative and qualitative performance colonoscopy indicators in patients within the BCSP with those outside the programme (NON-BCSP). PARTICIPANTS: 720 patients that had undergone day case colonoscopy. SETTING: Accredited BCSP centre: University Hospitals Aintree, UK. INTERVENTION: Comparing patient satisfaction between BCSP to NON-BCSP populations. RESULTS: Uptake was 68% (n=488). Caecal intubation rate (CIR) was higher (99 v 91%; p=0.001), and sedation doses lower in BCSP compared to NON-BCSP (Midazolam dose Median [IQR] (1 [0, 2] v 2 [1, 3] mg; respectively p=0.0001). For patient satisfaction and experience, scores were high and pain scores were low in both groups; with no statistically significant difference between groups. However, willingness to have a repeat procedure was higher in BCSP (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst superior CIR with less sedation within BCSP, overall scores were similar for patient satisfaction, both in and outside the programme. With the higher 'willingness for repeat' within BCSP, a positive impact of higher level of QA is suggested and that good patient experience can be achieved with minimal conscious sedation in expert hands.
