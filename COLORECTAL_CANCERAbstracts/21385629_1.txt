Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. To identify candidates for biomarkers and therapeutic targets, we investigated the proteome of colorectal cancer tissues. Using 2D-DIGE in combination with our original large format electrophoresis apparatus, we compared surgically resected normal and tumor tissues from 53 patients with colorectal cancer. We focused on proteins with an alkaline pI using IPG gels for the alkaline range. We observed 1687 protein spots, and found 100 spots with statistical (p<0.01) and significant (>2-fold) differences between the normal and the tumor tissue groups. Among these 100 protein spots, five showed a different intensity between tumor tissues from the stage-II and the stage-III patients. MS experiments revealed that these 100 protein spots corresponded to 58 unique proteins. These included six proteins which had not been previously reported to be associated with colorectal cancer. Among these proteins, five were not reported in any type of malignancy. IEF/western blotting confirmed the differences in protein expression between the normal and the tumor tissues. These results may provide an insight for biomarker development and drug target discovery in colorectal cancer.
