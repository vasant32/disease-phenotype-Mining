The Genetic and Endoscopic Surveillance Clinic is an annual outreach service offering accessible colonoscopic surveillance to known families with Lynch syndrome living in remote areas of the Western and Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Unfortunately attendance at this outreach clinic has been declining over several years and fewer than a quarter of participants, attending for surveillance, have been adherent with all their recommended screening appointments. Concerns exist for non-adherent individuals as screening can prevent colorectal cancer by removing the precancerous lesion or enabling the treatment of a malignancy at an early stage. This study explored the experience of surveillance from both the non-adherers' and adherers' perspectives and identified unique factors affecting attendance at the outreach clinic. Rates of compliance are calculated for 191 mutation-positive cases of Lynch syndrome, using strict attendance criteria, and compared to figures obtained from self-reported attendance. Non-compliance was under-reported and compliance was exaggerated when basing data on self-reported adherence to recommendations. Specific characteristics of the outreach clinic affecting compliance are identified and recommendations are made to facilitate improvements to the service. These improvements can result in increased compliance with screening regimens and ultimately reduce cancer-related mortality.
