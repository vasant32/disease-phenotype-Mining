Abstract   A 63-year-old man underwent a colectomy for sigmoid colon cancer in 1997. The upper lobe of his left lung and his left adrenal gland were resected because of metachronous metastases, 7 and 10 years after the initial surgery, respectively. Recurrence of metastases to the middle lobe of the right lung and left adrenal gland were sequentially detected in 2007, and a multimodal therapy, consisting of the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, was conducted since 2007. The chemotherapy included drugs such as FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, bevacizumab, capecitabine, and cetuximab. In 2011, the complete response of all metastatic lesions could be achieved, and no recurrence was detected for more than 1 year. In spite of repeated recurrences, by the combination of surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, the complete response could be achieved 14 years after the initial surgical resection, which can be attributed to the development of new treatment modalities and new agents for colorectal cancer.
