Tumor growth and angiogenic factors are usually overexpressed in colorectal carcinomas. We aimed to assess the prognostic role of VEGF, bFGF, PDGF-AA, EGF, HGF, and E-selectin in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) chemotherapy protocol. Thirty-eight colorectal cancer patients who had evidence of distant metastasis were enrolled in the study. Angiogenic factors were measured before and after third cycle of chemotherapy. Patients were randomized into three groups, partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) groups, according to their clinical and radiologic evaluation after three cycles of XELOX chemotherapy. Eighteen patients (47.3 %) achieved partial response, 10 (26.3 %) stable disease, and 10 (26.3 %) progressive disease. VEGF (63.20 Pg/ml vs. 19,79 Pg/ml; p < 0.001), EGF (7.29 ± 3.08 Pg/ml vs. 4.79 ± 2.05 Pg/ml; p < 0.011), HGF (618.16 ± 340.39 Pg/ml vs. 452.02 ± 217.18 Pg/ml; p < 0.049), and PDGF-AA (691.68 ± 187.10 Pg/ml vs. 404.89 ± 168.47 Pg/ml; p < 0.001) were significantly decreased in PR group. PDGF-AA levels were also decreased in SD group (706.66 ± 206.66 Pg/ml vs. 389.79 ± 143.16 Pg/ml; p < 0,001). HGF levels were significantly increased in PD disease group (449.99 Pg/ml vs. 682.22 Pg/ml; p < 0.046). The baseline E-selectin levels were inversely proportional with overall survival that could be an important prognostic factor at the time of diagnosis. This study demonstrated that tumor growth factors can be helpful to determine colorectal cancer prognosis and overall survival in patients with metastatic disease. VEGF, HGF, EGF, and PDGF-AA levels were decreased in PR group. However, meaningful increment was seen HGF levels in PD group. Angiogenic factors and E-selectin provided unique prognostic information in advanced colorectal carcinoma patients.
