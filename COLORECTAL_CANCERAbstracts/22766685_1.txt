MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that play important roles in             the multistep process of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) development. The present study             evaluated the relationship between miR-1-1 and miR-133a-2 expression and DNA methylation,             and its putative biological role in CRC. The results indicated that DNA methylation             regulated the expression of the miR-1-1 and miR-133a-2 cluster in CRC cell lines.             Expression of miR-1 and miR-133a was further evaluated in 64 paired tissue samples             (CRC tumor and adjacent normal mucosa) using the stem-loop real-time polymerase             chain reaction. The miR-1-133a cluster displayed significantly lower expression             in CRC tissue compared to adjacent normal mucosa (P<0.001). The results also             indicated frequent hypermethylation of the CpG islands upstream of miR-1-133a             (54.6%). Liver metastatic tissues exhibited significantly lower miR-1 (P<0.001)             and miR-133a (P<0.001) expression compared to adjacent normal mucosa. Expression             of the miR-1-133a cluster inversely correlated with TAGLN2 in the tumor specimens.             In conclusion, epigenetic repression of the miR-1-133a cluster may play a critical             role in colorectal cancer metastasis by silencing TAGLN2.
