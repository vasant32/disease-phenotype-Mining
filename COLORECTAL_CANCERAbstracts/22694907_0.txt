 AIMS: Epidermal growth factor (EGFR) is involved in angiogenesis, cell differentiation, proliferation and progression of many cancers and is an important therapy target in lung and colorectal cancer. To determine the potential applicability of EGFR targeted therapies, EGFR status of over 800 salivary gland tumors of different entities were analyzed on DNA and protein level by FISH and IHC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A tissue microarray was constructed from 721 carcinomas and 205 adenomas of the salivary gland. EGFR expression and EGFR gene copy number was assessed by means of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). EGFR mutation analysis of exon 19 and 21 was performed in a subset of 107 carcinomas. RESULTS: Positive immunohistochemical staining (definition?) for EGFR was shown in 324 of 663 (48.9%) salivary gland carcinomas. The frequency was dependent on the tumor entity and ranged from 17.9% (30 of 168 cases) positive immunostaining in acinic cell adenocarcinomas to 85.7% (42 of 49 cases) in Warthin tumors. No EGFR amplification was found by FISH. EGFR mutation analysis of Exon 19 and 21 in 107 salivary gland carcinomas revealed mutations in two acinic cell adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSION: EGFR protein expression is common in salivary gland tumors but is not associated with gene amplification. Activating mutations of EGFR are rare. Nonetheless, selected cases of patients with salivary gland carcinomas might potentially benefit of anti-EGFR therapy.
