 BACKGROUND: Genes of the adiponectin pathway are interesting candidates for colorectal cancer risk based on the potential association between colorectal cancer and obesity. However, variants of the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) have been demonstrated to be inconsistently associated with risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: The current study attempted to evaluate these findings by examining several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously genotyped as part of a genome-wide association study in the ADIPOQ gene. Genotyping was also performed for a previously reported risk variant, rs266729, in 1062 individuals with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and 1062 controls matched on age, gender and ethnicity (Jewish or not Jewish) as part of a population-based case-control study in Israel. RESULTS: No evidence was found for an association between ADIPOQ and risk of colorectal cancer. The single nucleotide variant previously associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer, rs266729, revealed an adjusted odds ratio of 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-1.23. CONCLUSION: The SNP, rs266729, was not strongly associated with colorectal cancer in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent or other ethnic groups in Israel.
