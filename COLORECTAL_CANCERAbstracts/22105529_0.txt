 PURPOSE: The central venous access port (CV-port) system was examined in a series of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: One hundred and one CRC patients underwent chemotherapy with the 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or 5-fluorouracil + irinotecan regimen. The complications of the CV-port system were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: The CV-port system was placed in a total of 101 patients. The patients received a total of 1035 courses of these regimens. Eight complications occurred in the 101 patients (7.9%). The complications included three instances of catheter rupture, two thrombotic events around the catheter, and three infections at the site of the port or catheter. The complications were identified after a median of nine courses (range 6-16) and 135 days after the placement of the CV-port system. Sixty-six of the 101 patients switched their regimen from FOLFOX to another regimen, and 4 of these 66 patients (6.1%) experienced complications associated with the CV-port system. There were 25 subjects who were admitted to the hospital emergency wing during the chemotherapeutic regimens, and 4 of these patients (16%) had complications associated with the CV-port system. CONCLUSIONS: The complications of the CV-port system occurred at a defined rate, therefore the early diagnosis and the appropriate treatment to address these complications is crucial.
