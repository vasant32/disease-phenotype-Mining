Clostridium sordellii is a Gram-positive bacterium which can cause a serious toxic shock syndrome with a mortality of up to 69%. C. sordellii is a part of the normal vaginal flora in up to 10% of all women. This case describes a fatal case of a healthy 49 year-old woman with a C. sordellii-infection originating from an ovarian cyst. Quick diagnosis is difficult because of the non-specific flu-like symptoms. Survival requires immediate source control and specific antibiotic therapy capable of suppressing toxin production. In rodents superantigen antibodies have shown neutralizing effects.
