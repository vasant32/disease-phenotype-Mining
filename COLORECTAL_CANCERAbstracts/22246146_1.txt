 OBJECTIVE: To determine the positive predictive value (PPV) for polyps ≥ 6 mm detected at CT colonography (CTC) performed without cathartic preparation, with low-dose iodine faecal tagging regimen and to evaluate patient experience. METHODS: 1920 average-risk patients underwent CTC without cathartic preparation. Faecal tagging was performed by diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium at a total dose of 60 ml (22.2 g of iodine).The standard interpretation method was primary 3D with 2D problem solving. We calculated per-patient and per-polyp PPV in relation to size and morphology. All colonic segments were evaluated for image quality (faecal tagging, amount of liquid and solid residual faeces and luminal distension). Patients completed a questionnaire before and after CTC to assess preparation and examination experience. RESULTS: Per-polyp PPV for detected lesions of ≥ 6 mm, 6-9 mm, ≥ 10 mm and ≥ 30 mm were 94.3%, 93.1%, 94.7% and 98%, respectively. Per-polyp PPV, according to lesion morphology, was 94.6%, 97.3% and 85.1% for sessile, pedunculated and flat polyps, respectively. Per-patient PPV was 92.8%. Preparation without frank cathartics was reported to cause minimal discomfort by 78.9% of patients. CONCLUSION: CTC without cathartic preparation and low-dose iodine faecal tagging may yield high PPVs for lesions ≥ 6 mm and is well accepted by patients. KEY POINTS: • Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) without cathartic preparation is well accepted by patients • Cathartic-free faecal tagging CTC yields high positive predictive values • CTC without cathartic preparation could improve uptake of colorectal cancer screening.
