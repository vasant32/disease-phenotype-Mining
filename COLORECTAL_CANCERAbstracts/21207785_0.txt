Thousands of lives could be saved annually if everyone underwent appropriate colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Community education programs are needed to encourage people to see his or her physician, while every physician must take it upon himself or herself to screen every person over the age of 50 for colorectal cancer. If comprehensive screening were to take place, additional endoscopists would be needed to meet the demand.
