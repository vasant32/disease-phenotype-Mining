Visceral obesity is characterized by increased risk of cardiovascular disease as well as higher incidence of malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC), although the mechanisms linking excess adiposity with cancer are only partly characterized. Visceral obesity is currently acknowledged as a chronic inflammatory disorder and a growing body of evidence demonstrates the interconnections between obesity-related secretion pattern of adipo/cytokines and CRC. Specific molecules derived from the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), including adiponectin, leptin and resistin, are able to establish a positive feedback loop, thus increasing the proinflammatory and insulin resistant state and promoting tumorigenesis. Interestingly, these molecules have emerged as novel prognostic factors and therapeutic targets. This review will focus on current molecular and clinical evidence linking VAT-related inflammation to CRC initiation and progression, and summarize the role of dietary factors and lifestyle interventions aimed at promoting weight control and physical activity on CRC prevention and prognosis.
