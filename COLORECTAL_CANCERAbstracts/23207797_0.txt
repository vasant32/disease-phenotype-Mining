Patients with colorectal cancer with mutated PIK3CA, identified from two large observational cohorts, had increased cancer-specific and overall survival if they used aspirin regularly after diagnosis compared to non-users. No effect of aspirin was seen in patients with wild-type PIK3CA. Mutated PIK3CA might be a useful biomarker to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant aspirin therapy.
