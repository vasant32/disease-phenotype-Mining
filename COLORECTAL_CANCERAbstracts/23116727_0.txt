OBJECTIVES: Surgical resection and radio-frequency ablation (RFA) are standard therapeutic procedures for colorectal metastases confined to the liver. The presence of extrahepatic disease has a significant effect on the management of these patients. The goal of this study is to assess the value of positron emission tomography/computed tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG PET/CT) in the decision making whether to perform RFA or surgical resection of liver metastases in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients (23 men, 12 women; age range: 46-78 years) with colorectal carcinoma and liver metastases were prospectively enrolled. Nineteen of them were considered candidates for surgical resection and 16 for RFA. All underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT, helical computed tomography of the chest and abdomen and, some of them, magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen. The 18F-FDG PET/CT studies were performed within 4 weeks from conventional imaging, and additional findings were later confirmed or not, either by histology or follow up. RESULTS: In the surgical candidate group, 18F-FDG PET/CT detected extrahepatic disease, missed by conventional imaging, in 9/19 patients (47.3%). These findings directly altered the management in 7 patients (36.8%). In the group of RFA candidates, 18F-FDG PET/CT detected additional extrahepatic disease in 4/16 patients (25%) and directly altered management in all of them. Overall, in 11/35 patients (31.4%), 18F-FDG PET/CT detected extrahepatic metastatic disease. CONCLUSION: In patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastases, 18F-FDG PET/CT provides relevant additional information that has significant impact on management.
