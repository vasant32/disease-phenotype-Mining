 BACKGROUND: First degree relatives of colorectal cancer patients are at increased risk for the same disease. AIMS: To evaluate the prevalence of familial risk and its association with the occurrence of pathological significant lesions in subjects with positive faecal occult blood testing leading to colonoscopy. METHODS: Faecal occult blood testing is offered biennially to subjects aged 50-70. Subjects with a positive faecal test are invited to undergo colonoscopy. Familial history for colorectal cancer in subjects undergoing colonoscopy was routinely recorded. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2009, 4833 screenees with positive faecal occult blood test undergoing colonoscopy were enrolled. Twelve percent reported a positive first degree family history. Multivariate analysis evidenced that the probability of detecting pathological significant lesions was statistically associated with age, gender, type of test, repeated or first screening, and having at least 1 first degree relative with colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects attending colonoscopy reporting a positive first degree family history are at increased risk for pathologically significant lesions.
