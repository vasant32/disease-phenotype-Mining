 BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing liver resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) are often treated with chemotherapy before surgery. However, the associations between chemotherapy, liver injury, perioperative outcomes, and other confounding factors remain unclear. This study investigates the effect of preoperative chemotherapy for CRCLM on nontumoral liver histology and perioperative outcomes in a contemporary cohort. STUDY DESIGN: Five hundred six patients underwent hepatic resection for CRCLM between April 2003 and March 2007. Histologic evaluation of nontumoral liver parenchyma for sinusoidal dilatation, steatosis, and steatohepatitis was performed in 384 cases for which tissue was available. Patient factors, tumor characteristics, chemotherapy regimens, histology of nontumoral liver, and perioperative morbidity were analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty patients (65%) received preoperative chemotherapy for a median duration of 24 weeks. Irinotecan, increased body mass index (BMI), and diabetes mellitus (DM) were associated with hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis. Sinusoidal dilatation was not associated with chemotherapy or any clinicopathologic factors. Perioperative blood transfusion was independently associated with an increased risk of any complication. Major postoperative complications were independently associated with major (â‰¥ 3 segments) resections (57%) and perioperative blood transfusion. The use of any preoperative chemotherapy decreased the odds of major complications. Liver-related complications were independently associated with major resection and blood transfusion, but not with chemotherapy. Three postoperative deaths (0.8%) occurred, all in patients who were not treated with chemotherapy and had no evidence of liver injury. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate patient selection, liver resection for CRCLM can be safely performed in patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy.
