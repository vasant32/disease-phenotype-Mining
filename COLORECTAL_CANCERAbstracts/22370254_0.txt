 OBJECTIVES: To describe knowledge of and barriers to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening by sex and geography among Latino adults in Pennsylvania. METHODS: Eighty-two Latinos >50 years old engaged in one of 8 focus groups. Focus groups consisted of 4 components. Focus  group data were audiotaped, transcribed, and grouped into thematic units using content analysis. RESULTS: We found significant differences in the reported barriers to CRC screenings by sex and geography. Identified barriers were placed into 5 domains: (1) physical environment, (2) structural,  (3) sociocultural, (4) individual level, and (5) physician related. CONCLUSIONS: A targeted approach for CRC screening among Latinos may be better than the nontargeted approach.
