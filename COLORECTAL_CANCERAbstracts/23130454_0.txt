 BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer incidence rate is high and expected to increase in Thailand. But it is a preventable and curable disease if found in the early stage of development. The overall data regarding admission rates and healthcare cost in Thai patients are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To identify admission rates and healthcare cost of colorectal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Information on illness of inpatients and casualties came from hospitals nationwide and from hospital withdrawals from the 3 health insurance schemes in fiscal 2010. The data included 96% of the population and were analyzed by age groups, hospital level and insurance schemes in patients with colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer occurred in 45,692 of all admissions, contributing to admission rates of 98.5 per 100,000 persons. These figures increased with age. The highest admission was found in the central region including Bangkok (43%) followed by the northeast region (23%). The average hospital charges per admission in three insurance schemes groups: government welfare, social welfare and universal coverage were 64,241, 49,490 and 28,588 Baht, respectively CONCLUSION: Admission rates showed that colorectal cancer increased with age. The highest rate was observed in sixty years and older The hospital charges were extensive, especially in those on the government welfare scheme. Thus, screening programs, cost-effective analysis of treatment modalities and treatment protocol for the elderly should be examined.
