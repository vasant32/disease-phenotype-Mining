 AIM: To reveal correlations between serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and various clinicopathological parameters in colorectal and gastric cancer. MATERIALS & METHODS: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted by measuring serum LDH levels in 140 patients with colorectal cancer, 40 patients with gastric cancer and 20 hospital controls. RESULTS: LDH levels did not differ between patients with colorectal or gastric cancer and hospital controls. In colorectal cancer, LDH values were significantly higher in T4, N2 and/or M1 cases, with high specificities and negative predictive values, but low sensitivities and positive predictive values. On the other hand, there were no significant associations in gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: Serum LDH levels are increased in T4, N2 and/or M1 colorectal cancer. Most patients with early-stage cancer have normal LDH values, whereas in advanced stages, some patients have increased LDH values and others have normal values.
