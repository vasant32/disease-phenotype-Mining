 BACKGROUND: Tumor-specific immunity of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) has been reported in several cancers. We aimed to assess the role of serum IGFBP-2 antibodies (IGFBP-2 Abs) in early cancer detection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Glioma and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) were used as models. Serum IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-2 Abs were measured in 260 tumor patients (145 gliomas, 45 colorectal polyps, and 70 CRCs) and 141 controls. Receiver operating characteristic curves were applied. RESULTS: Serum IGFBP-2 Ab levels were significantly elevated in tumors (mean: 82 ng/ml, median: 17 ng/ml, range: 0-1387 ng/ml) compared with controls (11, 0, 0-212 ng/ml) (P < 0.0001) and higher in early than advanced cancers opposite of serum IGFBP-2 levels. IGFBP-2 Abs effectively discriminated between controls and grade II and III gliomas [area under the curve (AUC): 0.821-0.864; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.762-0.936; P < 0.0001], and CRC I-II (AUC: 0.668; 95% CI = 0.566-0.770; P = 0.002) as well as indicative of advanced polyps at high risk of CRC (AUC: 0.72; 95% CI = 0.630-0.811; P < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing grade II-III gliomas reached 66%-84% and 81%. Combined serum IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-2 Abs augmented the discriminative power of all stage tumors (AUC: 0.823), gliomas (AUC: 0.800), and CRCs (AUC = 0.917). CONCLUSION: Our results first demonstrate IGFBP-2 Abs for early cancer detection and in combination of serum IGFBP-2 for improved cancer diagnosis.
