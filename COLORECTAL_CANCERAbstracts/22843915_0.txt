 AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in splenic size and platelet counts, in patients with colorectal cancer during oxaliplatin based chemotherapy, and to determine their clinical significance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prospectively archived records of 50 patients with colorectal cancer that received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-eight men and 12 women, of median age 58 (range 35-77) years, were enrolled. Median spleen volume ratios were 1.3-fold after 6 cycles and 1.9-fold after 12 cycles. The incidence of splenomegaly was 30% after 6 cycles and 67% after 12 cycles, and of thrombocytopenia was 70% after 6 cycles, 82% after 9 cycles, and 80% after 12 cycles. Thrombocytopenia was found to be related to splenomegaly, and this pattern was notable after 6 cycles of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Splenic enlargement and reduction in platelet counts were common during chemotherapy. Furthermore, these changes were found to occur rapidly after 6 cycles of chemotherapy.
