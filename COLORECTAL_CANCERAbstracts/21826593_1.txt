 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of yiqi zhuyu decoction (YZD) combined with oxaliplatin plus 5-flurouracil/leucovorin (FOLFOX-4) in the patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). METHODS: A total of 120 patients with MCRC were randomly divided into the experimental group (FOLFOX-4 plus YZD, 60 cases) and the control group (FOLFOX-4 plus placebo, 60 cases), according to the sequence of hospitalization from January 2005 to December 2007. The treatment was supposed to be continued until disease progression (PD) or for 48 weeks (i.e., up to 24 cycles of FOLFOX-4). Response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs) were observed. RESULTS: RR was 41.5% in the experimental group and 34.0% in the control group [odds ratio (OR): 1.18, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.82, P=0.432]. Median PFS were 9.0 months and 8.0 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR): 0.78, 95% CI: 0.53 to 1.15, P=0.215]. Median OS were 21.0 months and 18.0 months (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.99, P=0.043) and grade 3/4 AEs were 56.6% and 76.7% (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.87, P=0.020), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: YZD combined with FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy significantly improved OS in this first-line trial in the patients with MCRC and significantly decreased grade 3/4 AEs. However, RR was not improved, and PFS did not reach statistical significance by the addition of YZD. The treatment of YZD combined with FOLFOX-4 may be necessary in order to optimize efficacy and safety.
