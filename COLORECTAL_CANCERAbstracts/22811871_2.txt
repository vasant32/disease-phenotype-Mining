Surgical resection for colorectal hepatic metastases (CRHM) is the preferred treatment for suitable candidates, and the only potentially curative modality. However, due to various limitations, the majority of patients with CRHM are not candidates for liver resection. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the role of thermal tumor ablation (TTA) as a component of combined resection-ablation strategies, staged hepatic resections, or as standalone adjunct treatment for patients with CRHM. Thus, ablative approaches have expanded the group of patients with CRHM that may benefit from liver-directed treatment strategies.
