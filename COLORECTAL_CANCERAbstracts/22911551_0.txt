The role of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) being consistently regarded as the main housekeeping gene and reference gene/protein for expression quantification in tumors has been gradually questioned and challenged by accumulated experiment evidence. The current review notified that the GAPDH expression was deregulated in lung cancer, renal cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, glioma, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, prostatic cancer, pancreatic cancer and bladder cancer. Interestingly, GAPDH was commonly up-regulated in a variety of types of cancer, which was revealed to be potentially required for the cancer cell growth and tumor formation. The relevant mechanisms were also discussed in current review. This work might provide useful insights for future studies on GAPDH in tumors.
