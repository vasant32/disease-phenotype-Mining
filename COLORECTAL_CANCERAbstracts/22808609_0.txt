The frequency and significance of hepatic lymph node (HLN) metastasis were retrospectively evaluated in 43 patients with unresectable synchronous liver metastasis of colorectal cancer who underwent resection of the primary tumor and histopathologic evaluation of HLNs between March 1997 and August 2007. HLN metastasis was detected in 12 patients (27.9%). No significant correlations were observed between the presence of HLN metastasis and any of the 12 clinicopathologic factors examined. On multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model, the presence of HLN metastasis (P = 0.002), along with a large number (> or = 4) of regional lymph node metastases (P = 0.003), and nonuse of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (P = 0.005) were identified as independent risk factors for shorter survival. To establish a new therapeutic strategy for initially unresectable liver metastasis of colorectal cancer, HLNs should be examined histologically in patients undergoing resection of hepatic lesions when they are rendered resectable by effective chemotherapy.
