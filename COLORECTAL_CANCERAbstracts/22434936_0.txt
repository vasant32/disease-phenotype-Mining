Colorectal malignancies may be stented to alleviate obstruction. The stent is a polarized and braided network of metallic wires. Pathology associated with colorectal stents is yet to be described. The authors reviewed 7 cases involving stented colorectal segments from patients lacking clinical suspicion of Crohn disease. In 4 cases, orientation of the specimens and stents matched the corresponding anatomic landmarks. In 3 cases, the specimens lacked helpful anatomic landmarks, and orientation was possible only after correlating with the intrinsic polarity of the stents. Stented areas showed artifacts resembling Crohn disease, including rounded cobblestones, pseudopolyps, and simple fissures, as well as unique artifacts including rhomboid cobblestones, complex fissures, oblique fissures with remarkably straight edges, and conical fragments of tissue that appeared to float. Crohn disease was misdiagnosed in 1 case in which the stent was removed intraoperatively and was never received. Colorectal stents help orient ambiguous specimens and induce patterned injury that can be confused with Crohn disease.
