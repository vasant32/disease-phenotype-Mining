The colon and rectum are the parts of digestive system of human beings. Cancer affecting either of these organs may be called colorectal cancers. Conventional cancer chemotherapy is not very effective for treatment of colorectal cancer, as the drug molecule does not reach the target site at therapeutic concentration, on the other side they produces sever systemic toxic effect. Aim of this study was to develop a novel colon targeted Assam Bora rice starch compression coated tablet for site specific delivery of 5-FU to the colon without the drug being released in stomach or small intestine. Core tablet of 5-FU was prepared using microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and spray dried lactose by direct compression method. The in vitro drug release study in different physiological environment confirmed insignificant release of 5-FU in physiological condition of stomach and small intestine further fast and major drug release in caecal content. In vivo drug absorption of optimized formulation was performed in order to establish its targeting potential in colon. It is concluded from the present study that Assam Bora rice starch can be used as a drug carrier for an effective colon targeted delivery system for drugs effective against the large intestine resident disease condition.
