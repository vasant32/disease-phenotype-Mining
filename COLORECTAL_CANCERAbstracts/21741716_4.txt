 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this single-arm multicenter phase II clinical trial was to assess the feasibility and tolerability of preoperative radiotherapy and simultaneous capecitabine and bevacizumab. Secondary endpoints were downstaging-rate and induction of complete pathological response. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with cT3 rectal cancer were eligible. Capecitabine (825 mg/sqm twice daily on radiotherapy-days weeks 1-4) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1, 15 and 29) were administered concurrently to pelvic radiotherapy (1.8 Gy daily up to 45 Gy in 5 weeks). Surgery followed 6-8 weeks later. A two-stage trial was designed with early termination at eight patients if more than three patients had experienced a common toxicity criteria ≥grade 3 according to the NCI CTC guidelines. RESULTS: In the first stage eight patients were enrolled. Median age was 70 years (range 55-76) and ECOG PS 0/1 (%) was 87.5/12.5. Major side effects were mostly intestinal bleeding (grade 3, 25%), diarrhea (grade 3, 25%), perianal and abdominal pain (grades 3 and 4, 25%) followed by anemia (grade 3, 12.5%). Tumor downstaging was observed in 37.5% of patients with complete pathological response in two patients (25%). CONCLUSIONS: After interim analysis of feasibility and tolerability, accrual was terminated according to protocol due to ≥grade 3 toxicities in 50% of patients. Complete pathological response was seen in 25% of patients but was accompanied by considerable toxicity. Further clinical trials are needed to clarify the role of bevacizumab in this setting.
