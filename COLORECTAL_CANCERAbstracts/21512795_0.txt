Colorectal cancer can be a painful event, generally associated with changes in lifestyle for many patients. We studied the quality of life of the patients operated for colorectal malignancies 5 years after the diagnosis. Using detailed questionnaires, we investigated 220 patients of both sexes (mean age 66.5 years) 5 years (or more) after a curative operation for cancer of the large bowel. The short form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire took into consideration several aspects concerning work activity, physical activity, psychological attitude, alimentation, familial relationships, and other relevant components of lifestyle. Moreover, we compared the perception of the so-called SF-36 score between our patients and a comparison group in the general population. Both univariate and multivariate analysis were used. The obtained results revealed that familial and social relations were equally unchanged or tended to improve. Sexual activity declined in only 61(31.3%) subjects. Rather surprisingly (because of the average age at diagnosis), work activity remained unchanged in about half of the patients. Using the SF-36 questionnaire, the main differences from the general Italian population were seen in bodily pain (especially in the few individuals in whom a permanent stoma was necessary), social functioning and general physical health. In conclusion the results seem to suggest that the majority of patients who survive for more than 5 years after an operation for colorectal malignancy return to an almost normal life. The awareness among individuals about their disease, the improvements in surgical techniques and medical treatments are among the factors responsible for these positive results.
