Two approaches to somatic point mutations in 12 and 13 codones of K-ras gene were analyzed: PCR/SSCP/ACRS/sequencing and allele-specific PCR in the real-life regimen (Russian set "KRAS-7M"). The comparison was carried out on 62 examples of genomic DNA extracted from frozen colon carcinomas, which underwent manual dissection. The results obtained in two attempts were consistent in 95,2% (N=59). Specificity and sensitivity of K-ras mutations detection using "KRAS-7M" set were 100 and 96,4% respectively, and 94,1 and 100% respectievly using PCR/SSCP/ACRS/automatic sequencing. False positive results were absent when detecting with "KRAS-7M" and accounted for 2 cases (5,9%) when using PCR/SSCP/ ACRS/automatic sequencing. The only false negative response (3,6%) was obtained analyzing mutations using "KRAS-7M".
