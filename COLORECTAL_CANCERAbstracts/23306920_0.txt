We report having treated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with panitumumab in our department. Ten patients were treated. The mean age was 65. 7 years-old with 7 males and 3 females. Seven patients were treated with only panitumumab, and three patients were treated with panitumumab and another drug. The median number of infusions was 8 times. In the 9 cases that could be evaluated, the disease control rate was 66. 6%. Skin toxicity was observed in all patients. A low serum magnesium value of grade 3 was observed in one patient. We consider that treatment with panitumumab for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was a safe option.
