The aim of this study was to evaluate coagulation disorders in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab by using rotation thrombelastogram (ROTEM(®)) and correlate ROTEM(®) parameters with routine coagulation tests. A total of 18 colorectal cancer patients who received bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy were included. There was no statistically significant difference between results of platelet count, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen, and D-Dimer obtained at baseline and on day 1 of chemotherapy cycles 4, 8, and 12. CFT value was significantly increased on day 1 of cycle 12 compared with baseline value by both INTEM and EXTEM assays while CT and MCF showed no significant difference. Correlation analysis revealed significant correlation between laboratory parameters and ROTEM(®) parameters. Platelet count showed a positive correlation with MCF in INTEM (r = 0.627) and EXTEM (r = 0.699) assays while showed a negative correlation with CFT in EXTEM (r = -603). There was a significant negative correlation between fibrinogen levels and CFT in INTEM (r = -0.617) and EXTEM (r = -0.512). Our data demonstrated the value of TEG over conventional coagulation tests in evaluating antiangiogenesis agents-induced coagulation disorders.
