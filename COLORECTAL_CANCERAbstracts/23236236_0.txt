 AIM: To compare the site, age and gender of cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) and polyps in a single referral center in Rome, Italy, during two periods. METHODS: CRC data were collected from surgery/pathology registers, and polyp data from colonoscopy reports. Patients who met the criteria for familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded from the study. Overlap of patients between the two groups (cancers and polyps) was carefully avoided. The χ² statistical test and a regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: Data from a total of 768 patients (352 and 416 patients, respectively, in periods A and B) who underwent surgery for cancer were collected. During the same time periods, a total of 1693 polyps were analyzed from 978 patients with complete colonoscopies (428 polyps from 273 patients during period A and 1265 polyps from 705 patients during period B). A proximal shift in cancer occurred during the latter years for both sexes, but particularly in males. Proximal cancer increased > 3-fold in period B compared to period A in males [odds ratio (OR) 3.31, 95%CI: 2.00-5.47; P < 0.0001). A similar proximal shift was observed for polyps, particularly in males (OR 1.87, 95%CI: 1.23-2.87; P < 0.0038), but also in females (OR 1.62, 95%CI: 0.96-2.73; P < 0.07). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of proximal proliferative colonic lesions seems to have increased over the last decade, particularly in males.
