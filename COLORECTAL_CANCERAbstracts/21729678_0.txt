 BACKGROUND: Patients with multiple liver metastases from colorectal cancer are at high risk of recurrence after resection. Hepatic artery infusion (HAI) alternating with systemic therapy after surgical resection may improve survival after surgery. METHODS: Patients with liver-only metastases from colorectal cancer amenable to resection/cryoablation were eligible. Previous adjuvant chemotherapy for a completely resected primary tumor was allowed. Alternating courses of HAI and systemic therapy included floxuridine (FUDR) by HAI. Systemic chemotherapy consisted of bolus leucovorin (LV) plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). RESULTS: Forty-nine patients had complete resection of their liver metastases, with 44% having more than 4 hepatic metastases and 78% having bilobar disease. Thirty-six patients had HAI FUDR alternating with systemic therapy. Patients received a median of 3.5 cycles (range, 1-4) and 3 cycles (range, 0-6) of therapy with HAI FUDR and systemic therapy, respectively. At the time of final analysis the estimated median disease-free survival and hepatic disease-free survival was 1.2 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-2.1) and 1.8 years (95% CI, 1.8-not available), respectively. Eleven patients (31%) were alive at this writing. All surviving patients had a minimum of 5.5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: This trial of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients who underwent complete resection with unfavorable characteristics demonstrates apparent improvement in outcome compared with historical series treated with surgery alone. However the results of this trial and other randomized trials of HAI do not appear to support its use at this time because of the development of more effective systemic options.
