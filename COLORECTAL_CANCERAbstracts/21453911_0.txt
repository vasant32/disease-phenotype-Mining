 INTRODUCTION: Optimising haemoglobin (Hb) levels less than 13 g/dl in the preoperative period can reduce the transfusion rate. With this aim, we developed a multidisciplinary protocol in our hospital for the treatment of patients proposed for colorectal cancer surgery. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A study was conducted on 437 patients who had surgery performed for colorectal cancer in the period 2005-2009. The data recorded were: demographic data, Hb and iron metabolism (Fe) at the time of diagnosis, Hb on the day of the surgery and on discharge, tumour location, preoperative adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy), tumour stage (TNM), iron treatment, transfusion rate, and complications at 30 days. Patients were classified into Group A; Hb < 13 g/dl and/or abnormal Fe metabolism, and Group B; Hb > 13 g/dl and/or normal Fe metabolism. RESULTS: Of the total, 53.3% were in Group B and were treated with Fe; 73.6% intravenous (IV), and the rest oral. The mean dose of IV Fe was 867 mg. The mean intraindividual difference between the Hb on the day of surgery and at the initial value, increased by 0.6g/dl in Group A, while it decreased by 0.8 g/dl in Group B. The mean intraindividual difference between the Hb at discharge and the diagnosis decreased by 0.4 g/dl in Group A compared to 2.5 g/dl in Group B. The overall transfusion rate was 8.6%. No statistically significant differences were observed in complications. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary and early treatment of colorectal cancer enables patients with a low haemoglobin (Group A) to be optimised, as well as achieving a lower transfusion rate.
