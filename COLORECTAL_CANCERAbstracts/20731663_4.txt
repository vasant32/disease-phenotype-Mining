Metronomic chemotherapy has been advocated recently as a novel chemotherapeutic regimen. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated liposomes are well known to accumulate in solid tumors by virtue of the highly permeable angiogenic blood vessels characteristic for growing tumor tissue, the so-called "enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect". To expand the range of applications and investigate the clinical value of the combination strategy, the therapeutic benefit of metronomic S-1 dosing in combination with oxaliplatin (l-OHP)-containing PEG-coated liposomes was evaluated in a murine colon carcinoma-bearing mice model. S-1 is an oral fluoropyrimidine formulation and metronomic S-1 dosing is a promising alternative to infused 5-FU in colorectal cancer therapy. Therefore, the combination of S-1 with l-OHP may be an alternative to FOLFOX (infusional 5-FU/leucovorin (LV) in combination with l-OHP), which is a first-line therapeutic regimen of a colorectal carcinoma. The combination of oral metronomic S-1 dosing with intravenous administration of liposomal l-OHP formulation exerted excellent antitumor activity without severe overlapping side-effects, compared with either metronomic S-1 dosing, free l-OHP or liposomal l-OHP formulation alone or metronomic S-1 dosing plus free l-OHP. We confirmed that the synergistic antitumor effect is due to prolonged retention of l-OHP in the tumor on account of the PEG-coated liposomes, presumably via alteration of the tumor microenvironment caused by the metronomic S-1 treatment. The combination regimen proposed here may be a breakthrough in treatment of intractable solid tumors and an alternative to FOLFOX in advanced colorectal cancer therapy with acceptable tolerance and preservation of quality of life (QOL).
