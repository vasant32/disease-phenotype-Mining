Decisions regarding colorectal cancer screening will continue to depend on local resources, which in some jurisdictions includes programmatic screening and individual patient preferences. I encourage gastroenterologists to participate in programmatic screening and assist in developing the colonoscopy quality assurance and improvement programs. Our involvement would ensure that we remain leaders in this area and that our expertise in quality in endoscopy is recognized. Finally, participation in programmatic screening should benefit endoscopic services by increasing resources to support higher colonoscopy volumes, shorter wait lists and continuing quality assurance.
