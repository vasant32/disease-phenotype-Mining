Alterations in tetraspanin CO-029 expression are associated with the progression and metastasis of cancers in the digestive system. However, how CO-029 promotes cancer metastasis is still poorly understood. To determine the mechanism, we silenced CO-029 expression in HT29 colon cancer cells and found that the CO-029 knockdown significantly reduced cell migratory ability. The diminished cell migration was accompanied by the upregulation of both integrin-dependent cell-matrix adhesion on laminin and calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The cell surface levels of laminin-binding integrin α3β1 and fibronectin-integrin α5β1 were increased while the level of CD44 was decreased upon CO-029 silencing. These changes contribute to the altered cell-matrix adhesion. The deregulated cell-cell adhesion results, at least partially, from increased activity of cadherins and reduced level of MelCAM. In conclusion, CO-029 functions as a regulator of both cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. During colon cancer progression, CO-029 promotes cancer cell movement by deregulating cell adhesions.
