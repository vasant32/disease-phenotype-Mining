 AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether the relative mRNA expressions of the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) and the excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) genes are associated with in vitro chemosensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer, respectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 67 patients with pathologic TNM stage II, III, and IV. TYMS and ERCC1 mRNA expression was determined using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The chemosensitivity was examined using an ATP-based chemotherapy response assay. A high response was defined as a response producing ≥40% reduction in ATP. RESULTS: The mean level of TYMS mRNA expression in the groups with low and high response to 5-FU was 2.35×10(-3) ± 2.16×10(-3) 2(-(ΔCt)) and 4.54×10(-3) ± 2.46×10(-3) 2(-(ΔCt)), respectively. The mean level of ERCC1 mRNA expression in the groups with low and high response to oxaliplatin was 13.92×10(-3) ± 9.90×10(-3) 2(-(ΔCt)) and 23.59×10(-3) ± 5.88×10(-3) 2(-(ΔCt)), respectively. Groups with high response to 5-FU and oxaliplatin had significantly higher expression of TYMS and ERCC1 mRNA, respectively (p<0.01 and p=0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: High expression of TYMS and ERCC1 mRNA was associated with better in vitro chemosensitivity to 5-FU and oxaliplatin, respectively, in patients with colorectal cancer.
