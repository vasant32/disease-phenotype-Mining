A 48-year-old man developed left hemiparesis nine weeks after herpes zoster skin lesions had appeared over the right forehead. Cerebral angiography showed bilateral changes consistent with cerebral arteritis. The patient's condition worsened after the angiographic procedure. Reports from the literature as well as the present case suggest that arteritis and ischemia best explain contralateral neurological symptoms that occur suddenly following herpes zoster ophthalmicus.
