We report a 28-year-old woman who had a severe headache after ingesting a large quantity of ethanol-extracted ginseng. Cerebral angiograms showed "beading" appearance in the anterior and posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries, consistent with cerebral arteritis. The close temporal association between intake of ginseng and cerebral arteries suggests a causal relationship.
