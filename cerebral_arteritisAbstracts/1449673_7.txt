Cerebral infarction due to fungal arteritis is an uncommon complication of neurosurgical operations and adjuvant immunosuppressive therapy, including long-term steroids. If unrecognized, the neurological deterioration which ensues may be mistreated by increasing the dose of steroids. A case of a 38-year-old Caucasian male who had no obvious immune deficiency or fungal infection prior to a craniotomy for cerebral tumour is described in whom perioperative aspergillus infection resulted in cerebral arteritis and extensive cerebral infarction with a fatal outcome. Long-term steroid therapy used in the management of cerebral tumours may carry an increased risk of systemic or cerebral fungal infection. The possibility of cerebral mycosis (arteritis) and dangers of its non-recognition are highlighted.
