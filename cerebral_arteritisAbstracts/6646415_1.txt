The central nervous system is rarely involved in rheumatoid arthritis. In this paper the authors report a case of a 50-year-old woman who had rheumatoid arthritis for about 6 years. A month before admission she presented a symptomatology resembling an expansive intracranial process. Angiography revealed cerebral arteritis and CT showed areas of hypodensity with marked contrast enhancement.
