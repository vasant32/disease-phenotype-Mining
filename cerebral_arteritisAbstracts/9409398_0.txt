To find out the causes of many epidemiological differences in Moyamoya disease in Japan and in the People's Republic of China, we performed a bibliographical investigation and an actual survey and reached the following conclusions: (1) Leptospiral infection can cause Moyamoya syndrome which cannot be differentiated from Moyamoya disease unless confirmed through the patients past history and a positive serum test; and (2) Moyamoya disease reported in China may include Moyamoya syndrome caused by leptospiral or other cerebral arteritis.
