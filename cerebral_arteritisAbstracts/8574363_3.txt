The pathogenesis of central nervous system disease in relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is unknown but may be related to cerebral arteritis. Previous reports have described clinical and histopathologic evidence of cerebral vasculitis in RPC; however, a neuroimaging correlate has not been reported. We present a 36-year-old man with neuro-ophthalmic features of RPC whose magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal gray- and white-matter high intensities. This pattern is consistent with cerebral arteritis as described in other systemic vasculitides.
