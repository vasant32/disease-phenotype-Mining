We report four cases of acquired aphasia with epilepsy syndrome or Landau-Kleffner syndrome in three boys and one girl who were previously in good health. Along with the clinical picture, we describe cerebral arteriographic findings, which consisted of obstructive arteriopathy of small and medium size vessels in delimited areas. A specific cause of the arteriopathy was not found in any case. We discuss the treatment (corticosteroids and calcium antagonists) and the course of the patients. In front of the possibility of being isolated cases, we discuss the interest of performing cerebral angiographic studies in patients with Landau-Kleffner syndrome in initial stage in order to confirm the consistence of these findings and the adequate treatment.
