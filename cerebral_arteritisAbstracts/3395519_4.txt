Cerebral aspergillosis is one of the most common mycotic infections in the central nervous system causing different clinical features such as brain abscess, granuloma, meningitis, and encephalitis. Cerebral aspergillosis, however, may lead to a cerebral vascular accident such as intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral infarction. In this report, we present two patients with cerebral aspergillosis accompanied by intracranial hemorrhage. A total of 124 reported cases of cerebral aspergillosis are reviewed to ascertain the pathogenesis of the associated vascular lesion. The first patient was a 9-year-old girl, who developed drowsiness with a headache during the medical treatment for acute myelocytic leukemia. CT disclosed subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage. The autopsy revealed that the aspergillus arteritis was the cause of repeated hemorrhage. The second patient was a 15-year-old boy with allergic purpura and renal failure, who suddenly developed a stupor with convulsive seizure. CT disclosed an intracerebral hemorrhage in the right parieto-occipital area. The patient gradually deteriorated and died in spite of the surgical removal of the hematoma. The autopsy revealed that the hemorrhage was caused by the aspergillus arteritis. Cerebral aspergillosis has two routes of infection to the central nervous system: hematogenous dissemination from the distant site (usually the lung) and direct extension from the contiguous site (usually the paranasal sinuses or orbit). The primary mechanism of neuropathology is different between these two types. Primary cerebral arteritis is most often seen in patients with the former type, whereas primary basal meningitis occurs in the latter. The incidence of clinico-pathological features is different between hematogenous dissemination type and direct extension type.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
