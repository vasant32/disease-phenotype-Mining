A 2 year-old child admitted for Haemophilus meningitis was immediately treated by adequate antibiotic treatment. Three days later multiple hypertonic strokes and periodic respiration occurred; a resuscitation was necessary. CAT scan showed an acute hydrocephalus with non visible 4th ventricle and low-density areas in both cerebellar hemispheres allowing the diagnosis of cerebellar infarction. External drainage of CSF was rapidly performed and maintained for 11 days with success. The child was secondarily discharged with temporary cortical blindness and persistent moderate static cerebellar signs. The etiology of the cerebellar infarction was likely to be an arterial thrombosis in the vertebro-basilar area, probably secondary to cerebral arteritis related to Haemophilus.
