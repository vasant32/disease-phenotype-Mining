Cerebrovascular disorders in association with licit or illicit drugs have rarely been reported. We report a first case of stroke associated with the parenteral use of ephedrine. A 44-year-old woman underwent spinal anaesthesia for varicose vein surgery. She was usually treated with propranolol and occasionally with phenoxazoline. During anaesthesia, ephedrine was administered by the venous route because of arterial hypotension. She developed intracranial hypertension and focal cerebral deficits related to multiple haemorrhagic cerebral infarcts associated with a reversible beading appearance on angiography consistent with the diagnosis of acute cerebral arteritis. The role of ephedrine in this case is discussed beside other causes of acute cerebral arteritis.
