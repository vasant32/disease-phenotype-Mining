 OBJECTIVE: Determine the serum levels of endogenous secretory receptor for advanced glycation end products (esRAGEs) in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in control patients with type 2 diabetes but no MCI, and examine the relationship of esRAGE and MCI with other clinical factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 101 patients with type 2 diabetes who were hospitalized in the Department of Endocrinology at Fujian Provincial Hospital between January 2010 and January 2011 were enrolled. There were 58 patients with MCI and 43 patients without MCI (control). Serum levels of esRAGE were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Other clinical parameters were also measured. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetic patients with MCI had a longer duration of diabetes; elevated HbA(1c), total cholesterol (CHOL), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), intima-media thickness, C-reactive protein (CRP), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV); and lower ankle brachial index (ABI) and esRAGE relative to the control group. Among patients with MCI, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was positively correlated with serum esRAGE but negatively correlated with CHOL. Spearman rank correlation analysis indicated that esRAGE was positively correlated with MoCA score and ABI but negatively correlated with ba-PWV, CHOL, TG, and CRP in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that esRAGE may be a potential protective factor for dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and MCI in patients with type 2 diabetes.
