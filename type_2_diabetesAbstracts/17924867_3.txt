 AIM: This study was designed to investigate the effect of acarbose in patients with type 2 diabetes with newly initiated insulin treatment who had previously been insufficiently controlled with oral antihyperglycaemic agents [haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) >/= 8%]. METHODS: In this 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 163 patients were randomized to receive acarbose up to 100 mg three times a day or matching placebo. Both the groups were newly initiated with insulin, which was adjusted according to blood glucose values. Primary efficacy parameter was the change in HbA(1c) from baseline; changes in daily insulin doses were also assessed. RESULTS: Mean HbA(1c) was significantly reduced by acarbose compared with placebo (2.31 vs. 1.81%, p = 0.033). Insulin doses were comparable at the end of the study. There was no difference in blood glucose and triglyceride levels between the treatment groups. Postprandial serum insulin levels increased in both treatment arms owing to insulin administration but less so under acarbose. In contrast to the placebo group, an increase in body mass index was prevented for acarbose-treated patients. CONCLUSION: As adjunct administration to newly initiated insulin therapy, acarbose enhances the optimization of blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
