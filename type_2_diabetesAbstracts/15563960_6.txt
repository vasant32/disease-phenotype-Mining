 BACKGROUND: High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is more sensitive than standard C-reactive protein (CRP) assay in evaluating the risk of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic events. By this time, there are several reports that type 2 diabetic subjects have higher serum levels of hsCRP than those of non-diabetic subjects. However, there are few reports about factors which have influence upon the level of serum hsCRP in type 2 diabetic subjects. We had evaluated the association of serum hsCRP level with risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in type 2 diabetic subjects. METHODS: One hundred and five patients (59 men and 46 women) with type 2 diabetes were recruited. Subjects with severe cardiovascular diseases were excluded. All subjects were undergone carotid ultrasonography for evaluation of carotid IMT. Serum hsCRP concentrations were measured. RESULTS: Serum hsCRP level was correlated with mean left IMT (r = 0.366, P = 0.003), maximal left IMT (r = 0.370, P = 0.002), mean right IMT (r = 0.281, P = 0.023) and maximal right IMT (r = 0.370, P = 0.002), body mass index (r = 0.377, P < 0.001), waist circumference (r = 0.342, P < 0.001), waist-hip ratio (r = 0.229, P = 0.020), serum total cholesterol (r = 0.202, P = 0.024), serum triglyceride (r = 0.292, P = 0.022) and serum low-density lipoprotein (r = 0.133, P = 0.044). CONCLUSION: Our result shows that serum hsCRP level is correlated with carotid IMT and the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and may be useful to predict accelerated atherosclerotic process in type 2 diabetic subjects.
