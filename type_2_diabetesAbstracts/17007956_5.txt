The aim of this study was to assess coping strategies of foreign-born men and women with type 2 diabetes in relation to demographic (sex, age, time in Sweden), medical, and socio-economic situation, and as compared with Swedish-born patients. Participants were foreign-born type 2 diabetic patients of European and non-European origin in primary health care in Stockholm County, comprising 41 men and 36 women aged 35-64 years, compared with Swedish-born type 2 diabetes patients, 121 men and 111 women. The General Coping Questionnaire, which measures five main orientations, dichotomised into "positive" and "negative" factors, i.e. 10 coping strategies, was used in the assessment. Medical and socio-economic data were obtained from medical records and postal questionnaires. Foreign-born men showed an impact on 6 of 10 coping strategies, and foreign-born women on 2 of 10 coping strategies, as compared to Swedish-born subjects. Longer time since migration and higher educational level were associated with lower scores for stressful coping strategies, while having financial problems and receiving a disability pension were associated with higher scores. In conclusion, the most stressful coping strategies were found among foreign-born men. It seems to be essential to improve and adjust diabetes care for immigrants, also including the psycho-social perspective.
