Physical activity plays a key role in diabetes management, and in reducing the risk factors related to the development of co-morbid conditions. This study examined predictors of physical activity (Static Model) and activity change (Change Model) for individuals with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a population sample of 1662 adults (510 type 1; 1152 type 2) using self-reported measures of co-morbidities, perceived difficulties in performing tasks of daily living (TDL), time since diagnosis, and selected demographic factors. Since the motivation for physical activity could be influenced by the initial diagnosis of diabetes, analyses were conducted separately for newly diagnosed individuals (diagnosed with diabetes < or =1 year), and those that have been diagnosed for sometime (diagnosed with diabetes >1 year). In the Static Model, a younger age (beta=-.11, p<.05) and having less perceived difficulties in performing TDL (beta=-.12, p<.05) were associated with a higher physical activity in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The presence of difficulties in TDL (beta=-.08, p<.05) and co-morbidities (beta=-.08, p<.05) were associated with physical activity participation in type 2 individuals diagnosed for >1 year, but not in newly diagnosed individuals. A shorter duration of disease (beta=-.07, p<.05), a higher body mass index (BMI) (beta=.09, p<.05) and female gender (beta=.07, p<.05) was associated with physical activity increase in individuals with type 2 diabetes. A higher BMI predicted physical activity change in both newly diagnosed individuals and those diagnosed for sometime. However, both genders were equally likely to increase their physical activity among newly diagnosed individuals. Although the magnitude of the study results are relatively modest, they could potentially guide and encourage future investigations in this area that could lead to useful insights in designing PA intervention programs for these specific populations.
