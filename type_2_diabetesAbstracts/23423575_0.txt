Type 2 diabetes is associated with microvascular damage that causes frequent infections in the skin and chronic ulcers due to impaired wound healing. To trace pathological changes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of lymphatic vessels in human skin of type 2 diabetic versus non-diabetic patients. The dermis revealed enhanced lymphatic vessel density, and transcriptional profiling of ex vivo isolated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) identified 180 genes differentially expressed between type 2 diabetic (dLECs) and non-diabetic (ndLECs) LECs. Bioinformatic analysis of deregulated genes uncovered sets functionally related to inflammation, lymphatic vessel remodelling, lymphangiogenesis and lipid and small molecule transport. Further, we traced CD68+ macrophage accumulation and concomitant upregulation of TNF-α levels in type 2 diabetic skin. TNF-α treatment of LECs and its specific blockade in vitro reproduced differential regulation of a gene set that led to enhanced LEC mobility and macrophage attachment, which was mediated by LEC-derived chemokine CXCL10. Our study identifies lymph vessel gene signatures directly correlated with type 2 diabetes skin manifestations. In addition, we provide evidence for a paracrine crosstalk fostering macrophage recruitment to LECs as one pathophysiological process that might contribute to aberrant lymphangiogenesis and persistent inflammation in the skin.
