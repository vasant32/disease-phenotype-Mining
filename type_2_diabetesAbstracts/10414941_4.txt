The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in Penghu, Taiwan and compare these estimates with those of the US (NHANES III). Diabetes and IFG (American Diabetes Association criteria, 1997) were assessed among a stratified random sample of 2500 residents of Penghu Islands, Taiwan. The prevalence (age-adjusted to world adult population) of diabetes and IFG were 16.8% (95% CI 15.0-18.6) and 21.0% (95% CI 19.0-23.0), respectively, among Penghu Islanders in Taiwan. Age sex-specific diabetes prevalence ranged from 10.0% in men aged 40-49 years to 29.4% in women aged 60-69 years. Prevalence of IFG ranged from 14.7% in women aged 40-49 years to 30.7% in men aged 50-59 years. Age, body mass index (BMI), and family history of diabetes were each independently associated with both diabetes and IFG. In addition, female gender, apolipoprotein B and triglyceride concentrations were associated with diabetes, and hypertension and apolipoprotein B concentration with IFG. Among persons > or = 40 years in Penghu, Taiwan, the prevalence of diabetes is up to a third higher and the prevalence of IFG is up to three times higher than comparably aged Americans, despite their having a mean BMI 2.2-3.2 kg/m2 lower than Americans. The alarmingly high prevalence of IFG in Taiwan may indicate an emerging diabetes epidemic.
