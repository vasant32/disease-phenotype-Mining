 OBJECTIVE: To study the prognosis of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes as per the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2010 definition but without diabetes as per the ADA 2009 definition. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 2,002 participants of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study without a history of diabetes were studied. RESULTS: During the follow-up of a mean duration ± SD of 7.7 ± 2.0 years, 346 people died (202 cardiovascular deaths). Subjects with type 2 diabetes as per the ADA 2009 definition (n = 468) had significantly increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with people without diabetes as per the ADA 2010 definition (both P ≤ 0.003). Subjects with type 2 diabetes as per the ADA 2010 definition but without diabetes as per the ADA 2009 definition (n = 150) were at significantly increased risk to die of cardiovascular diseases (P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Use of the ADA 2010 diabetes definition may be instrumental in improving cardiovascular risk stratification in people undergoing coronary angiography.
