 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is a Wnt-signalling-associated transcription factor. Genetic studies have clearly demonstrated that DNA polymorphisms within TCF7L2 confer the strongest known association with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, the impact of the TCF7L2 type-2-diabetes-associated rs7903146 T allele on biological function and morphology of human pancreatic islets is unknown. METHODS: Paraffin sections of pancreases from 187 brain-deceased donors (HbA(1c) <6.5% [48 mmol/mol]) were used to genotype the TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 and evaluate its impact on islet morphology and alpha and beta cell subpopulations following immunostaining for glucagon and C-peptide. Following islet isolation, we investigated the correlation between TCF7L2 genotype and in vitro islet functional variables from our in-house pancreatic database. RESULTS: TCF7L2 rs7903146 (T/T) was associated with reduced basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated human islets, and reduced islet density in whole pancreas. Morphological analysis demonstrated islet size was increased in T/T carriers. Furthermore, rs7903146 was associated with an increased glucagon/C-peptide ratio, especially in bigger islets. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 risk allele is associated with impaired insulin secretion, reduction of total islet number and quantitative as well as qualitative morphological changes in human islets. Understanding how the TCF7L2 genotype modulates its activity and how TCF7L2 impacts the islet morphology may aid the design of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
