AIMS: This study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, gemigliptin versus sitagliptin added to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled trial in 425 Asian patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes being treated with metformin alone. Eligible patients were randomized into three groups: 50 mg gemigliptin qd, 25 mg gemigliptin bid or sitagliptin 100 mg qd added to ongoing metformin treatment for 24 weeks. Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured periodically, and oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at baseline and 24 weeks after starting the treatment regimen. RESULTS: Twenty-four weeks later, adding gemigliptin (50 mg/day) to ongoing metformin therapy significantly improved glycaemic control. Reduction in HbA1c caused by 50 mg gemigliptin qd (-0.77% ± 0.8) was non-inferior to that caused by 100 mg sitagliptin qd (-0.8% ± 0.85). Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% while taking 25 mg gemigliptin bid (50%) or 50 mg gemigliptin qd (54.07%) was comparable to the results with 100 mg sitagliptin qd (48.87%). There were significant decreases in FPG, postprandial glucose and AUC(0-2 h) glucose, as well as increases in GLP-1 and β cell sensitivity to glucose (supported by homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function, postprandial 2-h c-peptide and insulinogenic index) in patients receiving gemigliptin treatment with their metformin therapy. There was no increased risk of adverse effects with this dose of gemigliptin compared with sitagliptin 100 mg qd. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of gemigliptin 50 mg daily to metformin was shown to be efficacious, well tolerated and non-inferior to sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
