 UNLABELLED: Sildenafil citrate has shown to display beneficial cardiovascular effects, suggesting that it may have other systemic benefits involving the endothelium. There is little data regarding the long-term use of this drug and the effects of this on different organs. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to determine whether sildenafil citrate diminishes concentrations of microalbuminuria and percentage of A1c in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial in 40 male patients, age 35-50, with type 2 diabetes. Subjects received sildenafil citrate 50 mg daily (n=20) or placebo (n=20) for 30 days. Levels of hs-CRP, microalbuminuria, homocysteine, A1c and erectile function were measured at baseline and to the end of the study. RESULTS: Men that received sildenafil citrate displayed a significant decrease in the microalbuminuria concentrations (p<0.01) versus baseline, (p=0.02) versus placebo and A1c (p<0.01) versus baseline, (p=0.01) versus placebo. In addition, we observed a significant increase in the total IIEF score after 30 days of treatment (p<0.01) versus baseline, (p<0.01) versus placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of 50mg of sildenafil citrate for 30 consecutive days diminishes microalbuminuria and the percentage of A1c in patients with type 2 diabetes.
