Considerable disagreement exists regarding the levels of immunoreactive glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide in patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide levels were therefore studied during oral glucose and mixed meal tolerance tests in normal subjects (n = 31) and newly presenting previously untreated patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 68). The tests were performed in random order after overnight fasts and blood samples were taken at 30 min intervals for 4 h. During the oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide levels increased in the normal subjects from a fasting value of 20 +/- 3 pmol/l to a peak of 68 +/- 5 pmol/l at 30 min and in the Type 2 diabetic patients from a similar fasting level of 27 +/- 3 pmol/l to a higher peak value of 104 +/- 6 pmol/l at 30 min (p less than 0.001). Glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide levels were significantly higher in the diabetic patients compared with the normal subjects from 30-90 min (p less than 0.01-0.001) following oral glucose. During the meal tolerance test glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide levels increased in the normal subjects from a pre-prandial value of 22 +/- 4 pmol/l to a peak of 93 +/- 6 pmol/l at 90 min and in the Type 2 diabetic patients from a similar basal level of 25 +/- 2 pmol/l to a higher peak of 133 +/- 7 pmol/l at 60 min. Glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide concentrations were significantly higher in Type 2 diabetic patients compared with the normal subjects at 30 min (p less than 0.001), 60 min (p less than 0.01) and from 210-240 min (p less than 0.05) during the meal tolerance test. The groups were subdivided on the basis of degree of obesity and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide concentrations were still higher in the diabetic subgroups compared with the normal subjects matched for weight. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an exaggerated glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide response to oral glucose and mixed meals which is independent of any effect of obesity.
