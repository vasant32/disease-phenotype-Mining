 OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of glimepiride versus metformin in pediatric subjects with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone or oral monotherapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 26-week, single-blind, active-controlled, multinational study randomized 285 subjects to receive glimepiride (1-8 mg once daily) or metformin (500-1000 mg twice daily) for 24 weeks. The primary end point was mean change in A1C from baseline to week 24. Safety was assessed by incidence of hypoglycemia and other adverse events. RESULTS: Significant reductions from baseline A1C were seen in both the glimepiride (-0.54%, P = 0.001) and metformin (-0.71%, P = 0.0002) groups. A total of 42.4% (56 of 132) and 48.1% (63 of 131) of subjects in the glimepiride and metformin groups, respectively, in the intent-to-treat population achieved A1C <7.0% at week 24. No significant differences were observed between groups in reductions in A1C and self-monitored blood glucose levels, changes in serum lipid concentrations, or hypoglycemia incidence. Significant differences were observed in mean changes from baseline in BMI between groups (0.26 kg/m(2) for glimepiride and -0.33 kg/m(2) for metformin; P = 0.003). The adjusted mean body weight increase was 1.97 kg for glimepiride and 0.55 kg for metformin (P = 0.005). A hypoglycemic episode with blood glucose <50 mg/dl (<2.8 mmol/l) was experienced by 4.9 and 4.2% of glimepiride- and metformin-treated subjects, respectively. A single severe hypoglycemic event occurred in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride reduced A1C similarly to metformin with greater weight gain, and there was comparable safety over 24 weeks in the treatment of pediatric subjects with type 2 diabetes.
