Serum PEDF levels (mean (S.D.)) were increased in 96 Type 2 diabetic vs. 54 non-diabetic subjects; 5.3 (2.8) vs. 3.2 (2.0)mug/ml, p<0.001. In diabetes, PEDF correlated with BMI, serum creatinine and LDL-cholesterol, but not with other lipids, HbA1c or CRP. PEDF did not differ by drugs, complications, or gender.
