OBJECTIVE: To investigate the evolution of visual acuity, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and its relation to 10-year cardiovascular mortality and risk factors in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and control subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 10-year prospective study consisting of a representative group of 133 (70 men, 63 women) newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients diagnosed at health centers between 1979 and 1981 and 144 (62 men, 82 women) nondiabetic control subjects recruited from the population register was performed. The frequency of AMD was determined by grading of 45 degrees stereoscopic fundus photographs. The subjects were studied at baseline and after 5 and 10 years. RESULTS: By the 10-year follow-up, visual acuity had declined more markedly in the diabetic patients than in the control subjects. Although the frequency of AMD was nearly the same in both groups (11-19%), it decreased visual acuity earlier in the diabetic patients than in the control group. AMD at baseline predicted 10-year cardiovascular mortality independently of adjustment for other risk factors in the diabetic patients (odds ratio [95% CI] 4.7 [1.1-19.3], P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Visual acuity deteriorated earlier in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients than in the control group although the cross-sectional frequency of AMD was nearly the same in both groups. Interestingly, AMD was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic patients, but the background mechanism(s) behind this association is unknown.
