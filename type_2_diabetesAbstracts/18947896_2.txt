Diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Its early clinical sign is microalbuminuria, which is not only a predictor for progression of nephropathy but also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A few decades ago, diabetic nephropathy was believed to be progressive and irreversible. Thus, the main therapeutic objective for type 2 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria was to prevent progression to overt proteinuria. However, there is now growing evidence regarding remission/regression of diabetic nephropathy. In recent clinical trials using the renin-angiotensin system blockade drugs, a reduction in microalbuminuria by the use of these drugs has been noted. We also reported that a reduction in microalbuminuria was more frequent than progression to overt proteinuria and that multifactorial control approach was important to the reduction of microalbuminuria. These results for type 2 diabetes are similar to those previously reported for type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, our recent study showed that the 8-year cumulative incidence rate of renal and cardiovascular events was significantly lower in patients with remission than in those without it. The annual decline rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with remission was also significantly slower. These studies provide clinical evidence implying that the reduction of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients occurs frequently and brings about renal and cardiovascular risk reduction. Reducing microalbuminuria is therefore considered to be an important therapeutic objective and may be a biomeasure of therapeutic success in type 2 diabetic patients.
