Hereditary factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. A polymorphism in the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) gene (HSLi6) is associated with obesity and diabetes, although it is unknown whether the polymorphism is functional and thereby influences lipolysis. We genotyped 355 apparently healthy nonobese male and female subjects for the HSLi6 polymorphism. Allele 5 was found to be the most common allele (allele frequency 0.57). In 117 of the subjects, we measured abdominal subcutaneous fat cell lipolysis induced by drugs acting at various steps in the lipolytic cascade. The lipolysis rate induced by norepinephrine isoprenaline (acting on beta-adrenoceptors), forskolin (acting on adenylyl cyclase), and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (acting on HSL) were all decreased by approximately 50% in allele 5 homozygotes, as compared with noncarriers. Heterozygotes showed an intermediate lipolytic rate. The difference in lipolysis rate between genotypes was more pronounced in men than in women. We conclude that allele 5 of the HSLi6 polymorphism is associated with a marked decrease in the lipolytic rate of abdominal fat cells. This may in turn contribute to the development of obesity.
