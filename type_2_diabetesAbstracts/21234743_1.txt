 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the rs10811661 polymorphism near the CDKN2B/CDKN2A genes with glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and insulin release in three samples of white people with European ancestry. METHODS: Sample 1 comprised 845 non-diabetic offspring of type 2 diabetes patients recruited in five European centres participating in the EUGENE2 study. Samples 2 and 3 comprised, respectively, 864 and 524 Italian non-diabetic participants. All individuals underwent an OGTT. Screening for the rs10811661 polymorphism was performed using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. RESULTS: The rs10811661 polymorphism did not show a significant association with age, BMI and insulin sensitivity. Participants carrying the TT genotype showed a significant reduction in insulin release, measured by an OGTT-derived index, compared with carriers of the C allele, in the three samples. When these results were pooled with those of three published studies, and meta-analysed with a random-effects model, the T allele was significantly associated with reduced insulin secretion (-35.09 [95% CI 14.68-55.52], p = 0.0008 for CC+CT vs TT; and -29.45 [95% CI 9.51-49.38], p = 0.0038, for the additive model). In addition, in our three samples, participants carrying the TT genotype exhibited an increased risk for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) compared with carriers of the C allele (OR 1.55 [95% CI 1.20-1.95] for the meta-analysis of the three samples). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data, together with the meta-analysis of previously published studies, show that the rs10811661 polymorphism is associated with impaired insulin release and IGT, suggesting that this variant may contribute to type 2 diabetes by affecting beta cell function.
