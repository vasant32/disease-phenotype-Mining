 OBJECTIVE: Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a gluconeogenic enzyme that is upregulated in islets or pancreatic beta-cell lines exposed to high fat. However, whether specific beta-cell upregulation of FBPase can impair insulin secretory function is not known. The objective of this study therefore is to determine whether a specific increase in islet beta-cell FBPase can result in reduced glucose-mediated insulin secretion. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we have generated three transgenic mouse lines overexpressing the human FBPase (huFBPase) gene specifically in pancreatic islet beta-cells. In addition, to investigate the biochemical mechanism by which elevated FBPase affects insulin secretion, we made two pancreatic beta-cell lines (MIN6) stably overexpressing huFBPase. RESULTS: FBPase transgenic mice showed reduced insulin secretion in response to an intravenous glucose bolus. Compared with the untransfected parental MIN6, FBPase-overexpressing cells showed a decreased cell proliferation rate and significantly depressed glucose-induced insulin secretion. These defects were associated with a decrease in the rate of glucose utilization, resulting in reduced cellular ATP levels. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that upregulation of FBPase in pancreatic islet beta-cells, as occurs in states of lipid oversupply and type 2 diabetes, contributes to insulin secretory dysfunction.
