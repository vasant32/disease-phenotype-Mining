 OBJECTIVE: The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) R230C variant is associated with low HDL cholesterol levels, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome in Mexican-Mestizos. Because a pivotal role for ABCA1 in pancreatic beta-cell function was recently observed in the mouse model, we assessed the association of this variant with type 2 diabetes in this population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The initial group included 446 unrelated Mexican individuals: 244 with type 2 diabetes aged 20-69 years (121 with onset </=45 years), and 202 nondiabetic control subjects aged >50 years. An independent study group included 242 type 2 diabetic case subjects and 225 control subjects with similar characteristics. RESULTS: R230C/C230C genotypes were significantly more frequent in type 2 diabetic individuals (24.6%) than in control subjects (11.4%) in the initial study group (OR 2.501; P = 0.001). After stratifying by age at diagnosis, the association was significant only in the early-onset group (age at diagnosis </=45 years) (OR 3.776, P = 3.3 x 10(-6)). Both associations remained significant after adjusting for admixture (P = 0.0008 and P = 8.1 x 10(-6), respectively). Similar trends were observed in the independent study group, and the combined analysis of both populations showed a highly significant association of the R230C variant with type 2 diabetes, particularly with that of early onset (P = 7.6 x 10(-6) and 9.4 x 10(-8), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The R230C ABCA1 variant is associated with type 2 diabetes, particularly of early onset, in the Mexican-Mestizo population.
