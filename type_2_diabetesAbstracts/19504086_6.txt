 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The mechanisms allowing normalisation of insulin sensitivity and reversal of type 2 diabetes after bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD) have not been elucidated. We studied whether the expression of genes relevant to mitochondrial biogenesis/function is induced in response to BPD and whether the response differs between morbidly obese patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The effect of stable weight reduction after BPD on metabolic variables and expression of nuclear genes encoding for mitochondrial proteins or regulators of mitochondrial function was investigated in skeletal muscle. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp and substrate oxidation by indirect calorimetry. RESULTS: Both NGT and type 2 diabetic patients showed a net improvement of insulin sensitivity, with the latter also showing blood glucose normalisation. NGT patients had a large increase in glucose oxidation and substantial reduction in lipid oxidation. In contrast, type 2 diabetic patients had a blunted response to BPD in terms of glucose oxidation. NGT patients showed increased expression of genes encoding mitofusin 2, porin or citrate synthase; no significant changes were detected in diabetic patients. The expression of genes regulating mitochondrial activity (PGC-1beta [also known as PPARGC1B], PGC-1alpha [also known as PPARGC1A], PPARdelta [also known as PPARD], SIRT1) was induced only in NGT patients. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings indicate that weight loss after BPD exerts a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity via mechanisms that are independent of the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis/activity. Furthermore, the observation that gene expression is not altered with weight loss in type 2 diabetic patients while it is induced in NGT patients suggests a heritable component.
