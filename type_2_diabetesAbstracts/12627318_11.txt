AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 diabetes is associated with impaired insulin action and secretion, including disturbed pulsatile release. Impaired pulsatility has been related to impaired insulin action, thus providing a possible link between release and action of insulin. Furthermore, progressive loss of beta-cell mass has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible link between loss of beta-cell mass and impaired pulsatile insulin secretion with special focus on glucose responsiveness of insulin secretion. METHODS: The kinetic and dynamic profiles of insulin in GÃ¶ttingen minipigs are favourable for studies on pulsatility and a model of diabetes with reduced beta-cell mass has recently been established. Pigs were studied before (n=14) and after (n=10) reduction of beta-cell mass by nicotinamide (67 mg/kg) and streptozotocin (125 mg/kg) from 17.7+/-4.7 (normal animals, n=5) to 6.1+/-2.0 mg/kg. Pulsatile insulin secretion was examined during basal (n=8 normal, n=6 beta-cell reduced) and glucose entrained (n=6 normal, n=4 beta-cell reduced) conditions. Insulin concentration time series were analysed by autocorrelation and spectral analyses for periodicities and regularity, and by deconvolution for pulse frequency, mass and amplitude. RESULTS: Reduction of beta-cell mass and secondary hyperglycaemia resulted in correspondingly (r=0.7421, p=0.0275) reduced pulse mass (42% of normal during basal and 31% during entrained conditions) with normal periodicity (6.6+/-2.2 vs 5.8+/-2.4 min, p=0.50), regularity and entrainability of insulin secretion. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Neither beta-cell loss, nor 2 weeks of slight hyperglycaemia, as seen in the beta-cell-reduced minipig, probably accounts for the disturbed insulin pulsatility observed in human Type 2 diabetes.
