 OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery disease is the most important cause of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine the prevalence of silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) and the effect of statin therapy on SMI in type 2 diabetic patients without manifest cardiovascular disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was performed in 250 patients with type 2 diabetes without manifest cardiovascular disease. Patients were given either 0.4 mg cerivastatin or placebo daily. In August 2001, when cerivastatin was withdrawn from the market, cerivastatin 0.4 mg was replaced by 20 mg simvastatin without deblinding the study. The primary end point was the change in ischemic episodes, duration, and burden as measured by 48-h ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) over 2 years. RESULTS: At baseline, 47 of 233 (20%) evaluable ambulatory electrocardiograms showed evidence of ischemia. After 2 years, there was a trend toward more ischemia in both treatment groups, without significant differences between the changes in ischemic parameters (episodes P = 0.498; duration P = 0.697; burden P = 0.798) in the two treatment groups. Cardiovascular events occurred in 12 patients in the placebo group and in two patients in the statin group (P = 0.006). There was no relationship between these cardiovascular events and the presence of SMI at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: SMI occurred in 20% of type 2 diabetes patients without manifest cardiovascular disease. There was no effect from 2 years of statin therapy on SMI. In contrast, we observed a significantly lower cardiovascular event rate on statin therapy. AECG may not be a proper tool for risk stratification in patients with type 2 diabetes.
