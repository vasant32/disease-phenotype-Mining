 OBJECTIVE: This retrospective analysis assessed safety and tolerability of vildagliptin (Vilda) as an add-on to metformin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with normal renal function (GFR >80mL/min/1.73m(2)) and mild renal impairment (GFR: >50 to ≤80mL/min/1.73m(2)). METHODS: Adverse events (AE) from this 12-week, randomized, open-label study comparing Vilda 100mg and thiazolidinediones (TZD) as an add-on therapy in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled (HbA(1c): 7-10%) on a stable dose of metformin (≥1000mg/day) were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 2627 randomized patients, 1278 in the Vilda and 635 in the TZD groups had normal renal function; 463 in the Vilda and 230 in the TZD groups had mild renal impairment. Higher incidence of headache and rash was noted in both Vilda groups, whereas those with mild renal impairment receiving TZD experienced a higher incidence of peripheral edema and URI. Fewer patients in the Vilda group discontinued the study due to AEs compared to TZD group. Serious AEs were greater in TZD groups (normal: 2.4%; mild renal impairment: 3.0%) compared to Vilda groups (normal: 1.6%; mild renal impairment: 2.4%). CONCLUSION: The safety profile of Vilda or TZD as an add-on to metformin was similar in patients with mild renal impairment and normal renal function.
