AIMS: To determine the relationship between foot ulcers, arterial calcification, and peripheral occlusive disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study on 162 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent assessment of tibial artery calcification (TAC) by non-contrasted CT scan. Peripheral artery occlusive disease was assessed by angiography. Foot status including the presence or absence of ulcers was documented at presentation. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between foot ulcers, arterial calcification, and the extent of peripheral atherosclerotic occlusive disease. RESULTS: Patients with foot ulcers (N=31) were more likely to be older and have a history of tobacco use. They were also more likely to have higher TAC scores (median [IQR]: 4324.6 [609.9, 11163.6] vs. 9.4 [0.0, 343.9], P<0.001) and more advanced peripheral artery occlusive disease (occlusion index 5.5 [4.8, 6.4] vs. 2.2 [1.0, 3.6], P<0.001). Foot ulcer was strongly associated with elevated TAC scores in a multivariable regression model (odds ratio [95% CI]=2.76 [1.61, 4.75], P=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association between arterial calcification and diabetic foot ulcers that persists after adjusting for the extent of atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.
