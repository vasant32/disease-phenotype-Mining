Currently, diabetes mellitus is the fifth leading cause of death in Taiwan. The trends of diabetes mortality is increasing steadily. Epidemiologic studies also showed increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus over the past few decades. The incidence of diabetes mellitus in Taiwan has only been studied in recent 10 years. The areas that have been included as study areas for diabetes incidence are Kin-Chen (Kinmen), Chu-Dung, Pu-Tzu, Pu-Li and Pu-Tai. The reported incidence rates ranged from 1.0 to 4.0% per year for people with varying degrees of baseline plasma glucose levels not reaching the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus according to the criteria of the World Health Organization. Age, baseline glucose level, and obesity are important predictors for the development of diabetes mellitus. In the Pu-Tai study, which was aimed at following a group of people who had been living in the hyperendemic villages of blackfoot disease and had been exposed to arsenic from drinking artesian well water, the incidence of diabetes mellitus was calculated to be 27.4 per 1000 person years. The incidence of diabetes mellitus in these arseniasis-hyperendemic villages correlated with age, body mass index and cumulative arsenic exposure.
