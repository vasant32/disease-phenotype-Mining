OBJECTIVESPharmacological agents for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DN) target a number of mechanisms, including sodium-channel function and γ-aminobutyric acid-minergic processes. At present, prescription is undertaken on a trial-and-error basis, leading to prolonged medication trials and greater healthcare costs. Nerve-excitability techniques are a novel method of assessing axonal ion-channel function in the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of axonal ion-channel dysfunction on neuropathy-specific quality-of-life (QoL) measures in DN.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSFifty-four patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus underwent comprehensive neurologic assessment, nerve-conduction studies, and nerve-excitability assessment. Neuropathy severity was assessed using the Total Neuropathy Score. Neuropathy-specific QoL was assessed using a DN-specific QoL questionnaire (Neuropathy-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire [NeuroQoL]). Glycosylated hemoglobin and BMI were recorded in all patients.RESULTSNeuroQoL scores indicated significant QoL impairment (mean 9.08 ± 5.93). Strength-duration time constant (SDTC), an excitability parameter reflecting sodium channel function, was strongly correlated with QoL scores (r = 0.545; P < 0.005). SDTC was prolonged in 48.6% of patients who experienced neuropathic symptoms. A significant correlation was also noted between SDTC and neuropathy severity (r = 0.29; P < 0.05). This relationship was strengthened when looking specifically at patients with clinically graded neuropathy (r = 0.366; P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONSThe current study has demonstrated an association between markers of sodium channel function and QoL in DN. The study demonstrates that excitability techniques may identify patients in whom altered sodium-channel function may be the dominant abnormality. The findings suggest that excitability techniques may have a role in clinical decision making regarding neuropathic treatment prescription.
