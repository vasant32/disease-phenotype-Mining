The role of insulin in the therapy of NIDDM is still under discussion. To clarify the problem we performed a randomized double-blind placebo controlled crossover study of insulin treatment for 4 weeks in diabetic patients (n = 18, age 52-74 years) who were unsatisfactorily controlled by oral antidiabetic agents. The patients continued to use these agents during the study. Special attention was given to informing the patients about the trial and, in particular, about self-monitoring the blood glucose by the use of a reflectance meter. Insulin treatment produced the following significant changes: decreases in blood glucose (at 7.00, 10.00, 16.00), mean daily blood glucose, HbA1, urinary glucose and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increased postglucose immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels. Significant changes were also observed during the placebo periods: decreases in HbA1 urinary glucose and LDL cholesterol (but not in blood glucose). Therapy with insulin increased the body weight, whereas the placebo insulin had the opposite effect. The finding emphasizes the importance of using not only a run-in period but also a placebo design when the metabolic effects of antidiabetes therapy are to be evaluated. The study indicates that insulin therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes can be initiated at home.
