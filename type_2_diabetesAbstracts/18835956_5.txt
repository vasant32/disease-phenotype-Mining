 OBJECTIVE: Antioxidized LDL (anti-oxLDL) antibodies have recently been suggested to be protective against the development of diabetes. We measured the changes in anti-oxLDL antibody levels in the inverse situation of improvement in carbohydrate metabolism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was undertaken in 73 morbidly obese individuals, 21 of whom had type 2 diabetes, before and 7 months after they underwent bariatric surgery and in 11 healthy, nonobese individuals. Measurements were made of the area under the curve of glucose (AUC(Glu)) by an intravenous glucose tolerance test and of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and IgG and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies. RESULTS: The morbidly obese patients with diabetes had significantly higher levels of oxLDL compared with the morbidly obese patients with normal fasting glucose and the control subjects and significantly lower levels of IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies. An inverse correlation was found between the levels of oxLDL and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies (r = -0.352, P = 0.012). Although the levels of IgG and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies rose after surgery, this increase was only significant in the diabetic patients, who experienced an improvement in their metabolic profile. Different multiple linear regression models showed that the AUC(Glu) was the main factor explaining the behavior of the levels of oxLDL and anti-oxLDL antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: We found a close association between carbohydrate metabolism and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies, which were significantly reduced in the morbidly obese patients with diabetes. The improvement in carbohydrate metabolism after bariatric surgery led to a significant increase in the levels of IgG and IgM anti-oxLDL antibodies.
