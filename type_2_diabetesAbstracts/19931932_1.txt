The presence of white matter lesions (WML) is an important prognostic factor for the development of stroke. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP), which is associated with diabetes, has been flagged as a novel predictor for cerebrovascular events. This preliminary study was therefore designed to test the hypothesis that the presence of WML correlates with HSCRP and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients not receiving insulin treatment. Based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, 102 type 2 diabetic patients were divided into two groups; a WML-positive group (59+/-6 years, mean+/-SD, n=40) and a WML-negative group (58+/-6 years, n=62). The level of blood glucose was assessed by fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting immunoreactive insulin (F-IRI), homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The body mass index was higher in the WML-positive group than in the WML-negative group (p<0.05). Plasma levels of triglycerides were higher while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was lower in the WML-positive group than in the WML-negative group (p<0.01 and p<0.005, respectively). Fasting plasma glucose (p<0.005), insulin concentrations (p<0.0001), HOMA index (p<0.0001), and HSCRP (<0.0001) levels were higher in the WML-positive group than in the WML-negative group. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that WML was independently predicted by the high HSCRP and insulin resistance (p<0.005, p<0.0005, respectively). The results of this preliminary study indicate that the presence of WML was associated with the high HSCRP and insulin resistance in these Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus; larger cohort studies are warranted to confirm these findings.
