AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: AGEs, modification products formed by glycation or glycoxidation of proteins and lipids, have been linked to premature atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes. We investigated whether increased serum levels of AGEs predict total, cardiovascular (CVD) or CHD mortality in a population-based study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serum levels of AGEs were determined by immunoassay in a random sample of 874 Finnish diabetic study participants (488 men, 386 women), aged 45-64 years. These participants were followed for 18 years for total, CVD and CHD mortality. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression models revealed that serum levels of AGEs were significantly associated with total (p = 0.002) and CVD mortality (p = 0.021) in women, but not in men. Serum levels of AGEs in the highest sex-specific quartile predicted all-cause (hazards ratio [HR] 1.51; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.14-1.99; p = 0.004), CVD (HR 1.56; 95% CI 1.12-2.19; p = 0.009), and CHD (HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.11-2.52; p = 0.013) mortality in women, even after adjustment for confounding factors, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Increased serum levels of AGEs predict total and CVD mortality in women with type 2 diabetes.
