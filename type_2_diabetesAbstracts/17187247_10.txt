 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Studies have shown a relationship between pre-eclampsia and later coronary artery disease. This study investigated whether there is a relationship between pre-eclampsia and the development of type 2 diabetes in mothers and their babies and how this is affected by infant birthweight. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was an intergenerational cohort study. The study population comprised 7,187 mothers who gave birth and 8,648 babies who were born in Dundee, Scotland between 1952 and 1958. Their later diabetic status was defined from 1980 to 2003 by linkage to population-based datasets. RESULTS: There were 810 (11.3%) mothers with pre-eclampsia and 745 (10.4%) who subsequently developed type 2 diabetes. Logistic regression showed an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes for mothers with pre-eclampsia, unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.37 (95% CI 1.10-1.71), p=0.005. This relationship persisted after adjustment for infant birthweight, OR 1.40 (95% CI 1.12-1.75), p=0.003. Of the babies born between 1952 and 1958, 221 (2.6%) had developed type 2 diabetes, 137 of them male (2.9% of male subjects in study population) and 84 female (2.2% of female subjects). The relationship between pre-eclampsia in the mother and the risk of type 2 diabetes in the offspring did not reach statistical significance, OR 1.38 (95% CI 0.90-2.10). Babies with birthweight in the lowest quintile (adjusted for sex, gestation and birth order) had an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, OR for lowest quintile vs highest quintile 1.84 (95% CI 1.24-2.72), p=0.002. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Pre-eclampsia is associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the mother, but birthweight is a more important determinant of future risk for the offspring.
