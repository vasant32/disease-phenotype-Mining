 OBJECTIVE: To detect urinary proteomic profiling of patients with type 2 diabetes by using ProteinChip array technology, for searching new potential biomarkers in early diagnosis of type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN). METHODS: A total of 95 urine samples from type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria (DM, n=30), microalbuminuria (DNl, n=25) and macroalbuminuria (DN2, n=20), and healthy controls (n=20) were analyzed by SELDI-TOF-MS (the surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) technology combined with bioinformatics tools. RESULTS: Over 300 proteins or peptides from 1 to 80 kDa were obtained using ProteinChip. About 40 of them with the m/z values from 2008.78 to 79176.55 Da were significantly differentiated between type 2 diabetic patients and control subjects. Four proteins of mass 2797.03, 4545.77, 4984.03 and 9083.71 Da were selected as the potential biomarkers for T2DN with sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 96.7%. CONCLUSION: ProteinChip technology can help to discover new biomarkers and provide a novel non-invasive tool to early diagnosis of T2DN.
