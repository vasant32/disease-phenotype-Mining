The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk for vascular morbidity or death and retinopathy in relation to urinary albumin concentration. To that end, we performed a 5-year follow-up study of all type 2 diabetic patients attending the outpatient-clinic. A total of 444 (98.4%) out of 451 adult patients initially studied were evaluated for the degree of retinopathy and levels of HbA1c blood pressure, serum creatinine and urinary albumin. Vascular morbidity and causes of death were registered by one and the most severe event only. Forty-seven patients developed atherosclerotic vascular disease, i.e. myocardial infarction (n = 19), cerebrovascular disease (n = 20), or amputation (n = 8), and 42 died. The observed annual mortality rate was 22.1/1000 compared to an expected rate of 13.6/1000 for the general population with corresponding age and sex. Urinary albumin concentration was found to be a prognostic marker for the development of vascular disease and death in patients treated with insulin at baseline (P < 0.01), whereas this was not the case in patients treated with diet and/or oral agents at baseline. However, insulin treatment per se was not associated with an increased mortality or mortality or morbidity. Urinary albumin concentration was not correlated with incidence or progression of retinopathy regardless of type of diabetes treatment. In conclusion, this study showed that albuminuria was a prognostic factor for vascular morbidity and death in type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin but not in patients treated with diet or oral agents. Furthermore, albuminuria was not a predictor for incidence or progression of retinopathy.
