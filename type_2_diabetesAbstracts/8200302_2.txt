Aberrant expression of the IAPP gene may be involved in the pathogenesis and islet amyloid formation of type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus. We sequenced 536 basepairs in the 5'-upstream sequence of the gene of 35 Japanese with this disease and 3 patients with maturity-onset diabetes in the young. The sequences corresponding to both alleles of the gene were identical to one another and to the sequence of subjects without diabetes mellitus except for one allelic variation of 'A' and 'C' at the position -230. Analysis by allele specific polymerase chain reaction revealed no significant difference in frequency of the variation at this position between normal and type 2 diabetic subjects. We conclude that the 5' region of the IAPP gene is highly conserved and only 1 DNA polymorphism is detected and that this polymorphism does not associate with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
