We have followed prospectively, 46 obese, type 2 diabetic patients for a 55-week period, in order to evaluate the efficiency of an educational programme based on behaviour modification to enhance weight loss and changes of other cardiovascular risk factors. No patient received pharmacological treatment during the study. At the end of the follow-up the patients obtained an average weight loss of 9.250 kg (range: 0.500-17.500 kg); the BMI was reduced from 34.2 +/- 0.8 kg/m2 to 30.6 +/- 1.1 kg/m2 (P less than 0.01); fasting serum glucose descended from 7.9 +/- 0.4 to 6.1 +/- 0.5 mM (P less than 0.05); SBP (systolic blood pressure) decreased from 145.7 +/- 3 to 126.4 +/- 5.1 mmHg (P less than 0.01); DBP (diastolic blood pressure) decreased from 83.5 +/- 2.5 to 65 +/- 2.6 mmHg (P less than 0.01); triglyceride levels were lowered from 164.5 +/- 12 to 109.7 +/- 10 mg/dl (P less than 0.01); HDL-cholesterol levels increased from 1.27 +/- 0.05 to 1.53 +/- 0.12 mM (P less than 0.01). Serum glucose 2 h after a 75 g glucose oral load decreased from 14.9 +/- 0.6 to 12.7 +/- 0.9 mM (P less than 0.05) on week 35 of follow-up. Twelve patients no longer presented a diabetic curve (8 normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) curves, and 4 impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) curves). No significant changes in the parameters studied were obtained in the group of patients on conventional treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
