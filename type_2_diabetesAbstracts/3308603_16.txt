In order to define the effect of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus on the ability of insulin to regulate plasma-free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations, we determined the plasma FFA response to the intravenous infusion of various amounts of insulin. Plasma FFA concentrations were higher in patients with Type 2 diabetes (two way analysis of variance, p less than 0.001) over a plasma insulin concentration which ranged from approximately 5 to 55 mU/l of insulin. Although plasma FFA concentrations were higher in patients with Type 2 diabetes at any given insulin concentration, the relative ability of insulin to suppress plasma FFA concentration to half the initial value was comparable in normal individuals and patients with Type 2 diabetes, occurring at a plasma insulin concentration of approximately 20 mU/l. These data demonstrate that plasma FFA levels are regulated over a narrow range of plasma insulin concentrations in humans, and that plasma concentrations are higher than normal in patients with Type 2 diabetes throughout this range.
