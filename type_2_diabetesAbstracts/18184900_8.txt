 OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether self-rated health profiles compiled using the EuroQol group's visual analog scale (EQ VAS) are independent predictors of vascular events and major complications in people with type 2 diabetes after controlling for standard clinical risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study is based on 7,348 individuals with a mean follow-up of 2.4 years after completing the EQ-5D questionnaire. We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate hazard ratios associated with EQ VAS scores after controlling for baseline covariates: age, sex, smoking status, diabetes duration, A1C, systolic blood pressure, BMI, plasma lipids, and prior clinical history. RESULTS: A 10-point higher EQ VAS score was associated with a 6% (95% CI 1-11) lower risk of vascular events and a 22% (95% CI 15-28) lower risk of diabetes complications. CONCLUSIONS: Self-rated health profiles compiled using the EQ VAS provide valuable information on patient risk in addition to that determined from clinical risk factors alone.
