Small, dense LDL, as well as chylomicron- and VLDL-remnant lipoproteins, are known to be important risk factors for coronary heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between LDL particle size and postprandial remnant lipoprotein levels in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients. Forty-six patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were divided into tertiles according to LDL particle size. The peak LDL particle diameter was <26.30 nm in tertile 1, 26.30-26.85 nm in tertile 2, and >26.85 nm in tertile 3. After a test meal, tertile 1 had a significantly greater increment of triglycerides (TG), remnant-like particle (RLP)-TG, and RLP-cholesterol (RLP-C) than tertiles 2 and 3. There was a negative correlation between LDL particle size and the postprandial increases of TG, RLP-TG, and RLP-C. These results indicate that smaller sized LDL particles may be a marker of fasting state for an exaggerated postprandial increase of remnant lipoproteins as well as an increase of TG-rich lipoproteins.
