 AIMS: The aim of the study was to develop and test the feasibility of a three months web-based intervention, delivered by a smartphone to support self-management in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The intervention included use of a smartphone enabling access to daily web-based diaries and individualized written situational feedback. The participants registered their eating behavior, medication taking, physical activities and emotions three times daily using the mobile device. They also registered their fasting blood glucose level in the morning diary. A therapist had immediate access to submitted diaries and used the situational information to formulate a personalized feedback based on Acceptance Commitment Therapy. The purpose of the diaries and the situational feedback was to stimulate self-management. RESULTS: Eleven of the fifteen participants included in the study completed the intervention, which was evaluated as supportive and meaningful. Most of the participants reported positive life style changes. The response rate to the daily registration entries was good and few technical problems were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: The described intervention is feasible and should be tested out in a large-scale study. The developed smartphone application seems a promising tool for supporting patients with type 2 diabetes to make important life style changes.
