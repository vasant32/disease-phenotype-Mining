The socioeconomic burden of type 2 diabetes and its complications has become a big social issue in Korea. And so, the proper management of diabetes in terms of its prevention and management of complications are considered the most important tasks in our healthcare system and these can be accomplished through the multidisciplinary program. Our program is composed of separate educational programs for in-patients and out-patients, individualized teaching, and group teaching. In order to maintain such a program, there need systemic interactions among the team members, including endocrinologists, nurses, dieticians, pharmacists, and social workers. The optimal way to control diabetes can be achieved through interactions between members of the diabetes management team and the patient. For the patient, this is expected to lead to a better glycemic control, prevention of diabetes complications, and sparing of medical expenses as well. As for the healthcare providers, physicians are able to treat their patients more efficiently. Thus, both the patient and the healthcare centers can benefit from this multidisciplinary educational program. Diabetes educational program should be a basis for the management of diabetes.
