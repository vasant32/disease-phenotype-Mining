OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of thalidomide on glucose turnover (glucose production and uptake), on intracellular pathways of glucose utilization (glycogen synthesis [GS], glycolysis [GLS], carbohydrate oxidation, and nonoxidative GLS), and on free fatty acid (FFA) turnover (lipolysis, FFA oxidation, and FFA reesterification). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 6 patients with type 2 diabetes were studied with 4-h isoglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps (approximately 8 mmol/l and 500-600 pmol/l, respectively) before treatment (Prestudy), after 3 weeks of thalidomide (150 mg orally at bedtime), and after 3 weeks of placebo. RESULTS: Thalidomide reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 31% (from 27.7 to 19.2 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05) compared with the prestudy and by 21% (from 24.2 to 19.2 pmol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05) compared with placebo. Thalidomide also reduced insulin-stimulated GS by 48% (from 14.1 to 8.2 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.05) compared with the prestudy and by 40% (from 13.6 to 8.2 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1), P < 0.5) compared with placebo. Thalidomide had no effect on rates of GLS, carbohydrate oxidation, nonoxidative GLS, lipolysis, FFA oxidation, and reesterification. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that thalidomide increased insulin resistance in obese patients with type 2 diabetes by inhibiting insulin-stimulated GS and that patients taking thalidomide should be monitored for possible deterioration in their glucose tolerance.
