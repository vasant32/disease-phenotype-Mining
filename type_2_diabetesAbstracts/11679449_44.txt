 OBJECTIVE: The role of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in type 2 diabetes is still a matter of debate. In the framework of a nationwide outcomes research program, we investigated the frequency of SMBG and its association with metabolic control and quality of life (QoL). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study involved 3,567 patients with type 2 diabetes who were recruited by 101 outpatient diabetes clinics and 103 general practitioners. Patients completed a questionnaire investigating SMBG practice and QoL (diabetes-related stress, diabetes health distress, diabetes-related worries, and Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale). RESULTS: Data on SMBG were available for 2,855 subjects (80% of the entire study population). Overall, 471 patients (17%) stated that they tested their blood glucose levels at home > or =1 time per day, 899 patients (31%) tested their blood glucose levels > or =1 time per week, and 414 patients (14%) tested their blood glucose levels <1 time per week, whereas 1,071 patients (38%) stated that they never practiced SMBG. A higher frequency of SMBG was associated with better metabolic control among subjects who were able to adjust insulin doses, whereas no relationship was found in all other patients, irrespective of the kind of treatment. Multivariate analyses showed that an SMBG frequency > or =1 time per day was significantly related to higher levels of distress, worries, and depressive symptoms in non-insulin-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that SMBG can have an important role in improving metabolic control if it is an integral part of a wider educational strategy devoted to the promotion of patient autonomy. In patients not treated with insulin, self-monitoring is associated with higher HbA(1c) levels and psychological burden. Our data do not support the extension of SMBG to this group.
