OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the DD genotype is a predictor of mortality and of the decline in renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes and established nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 56 such patients of Maltese Caucasian descent were recruited, and their ACE genotype was determined. Serum creatinine was estimated approximately every 4 months. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated according to the Cockroft-Gault formula, and rate of change was determined by regression analysis. RESULTS: The rate of change in calculated GFR was -7.76 ml.min(-1).year(-1) in those with the DD genotype (n = 31) and -1.17 ml. min(-1). h(-1) in those with the ID or II genotype (n = 25) (P < 0.01). The 3-year mortality was 45.2% in the DD group compared with 20.0% in the ID/II group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The DD genotype of the ACE gene polymorphism is associated with a more rapid decline in renal function and higher mortality in type 2 diabetic patients with established nephropathy.
