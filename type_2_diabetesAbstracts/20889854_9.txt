 OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence in metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) between 1988-1994 and 1999-2006 among U.S. adults of different races or ethnicities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analysis of data on 6,423 adult men and nonpregnant women aged ≥20 years from Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) and 6,962 participants from the combined NHANES 1999-2006 were done. The revised National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III definition was used to calculate MetSyn. RESULTS: Both the unadjusted prevalence (27.9 ± 1.1% to 34.1 ± 0.8%, P < 0.001) and age-adjusted prevalence (29.2 ± 1.0% to 34.2 ± 0.7%, P < 0.001) increased from NHANES III to NHANES 1999-2006, respectively. Although MetSyn prevalence was highest in Mexican Americans, significant increases in prevalence occurred among non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks, especially among younger women. CONCLUSIONS: The persistent increase of MetSyn among U.S. adults is a serious public health concern because it raises the likelihood of increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes.
