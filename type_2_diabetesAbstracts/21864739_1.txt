Oral hypoglycaemic agents become less effective as beta cell function declines. Thus many patients with type 2 diabetes will ultimately require treatment with insulin. There are two main approaches to starting insulin: (a) as a basal supplement with an intermediate to long-acting preparation (NPH, glargine or detemir) plus oral agents; (b) as a premixed insulin regimen. Almost all the studies have shown similar glucose control with both NPH and the new insulin analogs. Further analyses between these insulins have documented significant reductions in hypoglycaemia especially at night with the insulin analogs. The weight gain is an important issue in patients with diabetes. It appears that insulin detemir studies have reported weight neutrality or less weigh gain or even weight loss. However, most insulin glargine studies have reported a weight gain. On the other hand insulin analogs have the important disadvantage of high cost. It is important to take in to account all the above factors such as cost, weight gain, number of insulin injections and hypoglycaemia while prescribing insulin.
