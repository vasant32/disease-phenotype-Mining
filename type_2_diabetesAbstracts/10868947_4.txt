A polymorphism (PP1ARE) in the 3'-untranslated region of the gene encoding the glycogen-associated regulatory subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase PPP1R3 is associated with insulin resistance in Pima Indians. The aim of this study was to investigate whether two common variants in the PPP1R3 gene, Asp905Tyr and PP1ARE, are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity or can predict the development of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes during a 20-year follow-up period in 696 50-year-old Caucasian men. The allelic frequency of Tyr905 was 0.11 (95% CI 0.09-0.13) and of PP1ARE 0.34 (0.31-0.37) and the two polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium (chi2 = 46, P < 0.0001, Fisher's exact test). None of the polymorphisms was associated with the development of IGT or type 2 diabetes, but the PP1ARE polymorphism was weakly correlated to whole-body insulin sensitivity (r = -0.08, P = 0.04). In conclusion, we found no evidence in Swedish men that the PP1ARE or the Asp905Tyr variants over a 20-year period predict the development of IGT or type 2 diabetes, but the PP1ARE polymorphism could have a higher penetrance in other populations.
