We previously showed that polymorphisms of the promoter area of chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) gene (59029G/A) and its agonist, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) gene (-28C/G) were new candidates for susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy. The aim of this study was to confirm the effect of these polymorphisms on the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. We performed a 10-year retrospective study of 191 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria at baseline. The subjects were classified into two groups: (1) those with persistent normoalbuminuria (group N) and (2) those with progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria (group P). Then, their association with CCR5 59029G/A and RANTES -28C/G polymorphisms was assessed. The frequency of the RANTES -28G(+) genotype did nor differ between the two groups, but the CCR5 59029A(+) genotype had a significantly higher frequency in group P than in group N (83% versus 71%, p=0.04). By discriminant analysis, only the CCR5 59029A(+) genotype showed an independent positive correlation with the onset or progression of nephropathy (p=0.03, odds ratio=2.41, 95% CI=1.09-5.33). Therefore, the CCR5 59029A(+) genotype seems to be related the etiology of diabetic nephropathy in Japanese type 2 diabetics.
