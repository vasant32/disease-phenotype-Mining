 AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between the metabolic syndrome (MS), adiponectin and abnormal liver enzymes in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Fasting serum was collected from 189 patients with type 2 diabetes, adiponectin was measure using radioimmunoassay and features of the MS were assessed. RESULTS: Mean ALT was significantly higher in patients with the MS and higher ALT was associated with lower adiponectin levels. As the number of features of MS increased, ALT increased and adiponectin decreased independent of glycaemic control. CONCLUSION: Hypoadiponectinemia and the MS may be linked with liver injury in patients with type 2 diabetes.
