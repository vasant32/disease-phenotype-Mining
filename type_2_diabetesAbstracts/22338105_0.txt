 OBJECTIVE: Emerging data implicate activation of the complement cascade in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the relationships between components of the complement system, metabolic risk factors, and family history of type 2 diabetes in healthy South Asians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 119 healthy, first-degree relatives of South Asian subjects with type 2 diabetes (SARs) and 119 age- and sex-matched, healthy South Asian control subjects (SACs). Fasting blood samples were taken for measurement of complement factors and standard metabolic risk factors. RESULTS: SARs were characterized by significantly higher properdin (mean concentration 12.6 [95% CI 12.2-13.1] mg/L vs. SACs 10.1 [9.7-10.5] mg/L, P < 0.0001), factor B (187.4 [180.1-195.0] mg/L vs. SACs 165.0 [158.0-172.2] mg/L, P < 0.0001), and SC5b-9 (92.0 [86.1-98.3] ng/mL vs. SACs 75.3 [71.9-78.9] ng/mL, P < 0.0001) and increased homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (2.86 [2.61-3.13] vs. SACs 2.31 [2.05-2.61], P = 0.007). C-reactive protein did not differ between SARs and SACs (P = 0.17). In subgroup analysis of 25 SARs and 25 SACs with normal oral glucose tolerance tests, properdin, factor B, and SC5b-9 remained significantly elevated in SARs. CONCLUSIONS: Increased properdin and complement activation are associated with a family history of type 2 diabetes in South Asians independent of insulin resistance, and predate the development of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance. Properdin and SC5b-9 may be novel biomarkers for future risk of type 2 diabetes in this high-risk population and warrant further investigation.
