 OBJECTIVE: Most patients with ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes (KPD) discontinue insulin therapy and remain in near-normoglycemic remission. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of glucotoxicity on beta-cell function during remission in obese patients with KPD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Age- and BMI-matched obese African Americans with a history of KPD (n = 8), severe hyperglycemia but without ketosis (ketosis-resistant type 2 diabetes, n = 7), and obese control subjects (n = 13) underwent intravenous infusion of 10% dextrose at a rate of 200 mg per m(2)/min for 20 h. beta-Cell function was assessed by changes in insulin and C-peptide concentrations during dextrose infusion and by changes in acute insulin response (AIR) and first-phase insulin release (FPIR) to arginine stimulation before and after dextrose infusion. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD time to discontinue insulin therapy was 7.1 +/- 1.7 weeks in KPD and 9.6 +/- 2.3 weeks in ketosis-resistant type 2 diabetes (NS). During a 20-h dextrose infusion, changes in insulin, C-peptide, and the C-peptide-to-glucose ratio were similar among diabetic and control groups. During dextrose infusion, subjects with ketosis-resistant type 2 diabetes had greater areas under the curve for blood glucose than subjects with KPD and control subjects (P < 0.05). The AIR and FPIR to arginine stimulation as well as glucose potentiation to arginine assessed before and after dextrose infusion were not different among the study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Near-normoglycemia remission in obese African American patients with KPD and ketosis-resistant type 2 diabetes is associated with a remarkable recovery in basal and stimulated insulin secretion. At near-normoglycemia remission, patients with KPD displayed a pattern of insulin secretion similar to that of patients with ketosis-resistant type 2 diabetes and obese nondiabetic subjects.
