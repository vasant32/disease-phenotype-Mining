 OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of the metabolic syndrome, can not only predict type 2 diabetes development but also cardiovascular disease. Thus, precise insulin resistance measurement in individuals at risk for metabolic diseases would support clinical risk stratification. However, the gold standard for measuring insulin resistance, the hyperinsulinemic clamp test, is too labor intensive to be performed in large clinical studies/settings. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using plasma glucose and C-peptide concentrations from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), we developed the novel "clamp-like index" (CLIX) for insulin sensitivity calculation and compared CLIX to clamp glucose infusion rates (GIR) (100-120 min). We evaluated CLIX in 89 nondiabetic subjects (58 female and 31 male, aged 45 +/- 1 years, BMI 27.5 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2)) who underwent frequently sampled 3-h 75-g OGTTs and 2-h hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp (40 mU/min per m(2)) tests. RESULTS: CLIX, calculated as serum creatinine (x0.85 if male)/(mean AUC(glucose) x mean AUC(C-peptide)) x 6,600, was highly correlated (r = 0.670, P < 10(-12)) with and comparable to clamp GIRs(100-120 min). In subgroup analyses, GIRs(100-120 min) were lower (P < 0.005) in type 2 diabetic offspring (6.2 +/- 0.7 mg x min(-1) x kg(-1)) than in sex-, age-, and BMI-matched subjects without a family history of type 2 diabetes (8.6 +/- 0.5 mg x min(-1) x kg(-1)), which was also reflected by CLIX (insulin-resistant offspring 6.4 +/- 0.6 vs. those without a family history of type 2 diabetes 9.0 +/- 0.5; P < 0.002). When compared with normal-weight subjects (GIR 8.8 +/- 0.4 mg x min(-1) x kg(-1); CLIX 9.0 +/- 0.5), both GIRs(100-120 min) and CLIX of obese (5.2 +/- 0.9 mg x min (-1) x kg(-1); 5.7 +/- 0.9) and morbidly obese (2.4 +/- 0.4 mg x min (-1) x kg(-1); 3.3 +/- 0.5) humans were lower (each P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: CLIX, a novel index obtained from plasma OGTT glucose and C-peptide levels and serum creatinine, without inclusion of anthropometrical measures to calculate insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic humans, highly correlates with clamp GIRs and reveals even slight insulin sensitivity alterations over a broad BMI range and is as sensitive as the hyperinsulinemic clamp test.
