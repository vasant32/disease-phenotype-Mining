Foreign, infection-associated or endogenously generated circulating nucleotide motifs may represent the critical determinants for the activation of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), leading to immune stimulation and cytokine secretion. The importance of circulating nucleases is to destroy nucleic acids and oligonucleotides in the blood stream and during cell entry. Patients with juvenile insulin-dependent diabetes, adult patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and adult patients with type 2 diabetes were allocated to the study, together with the age-matched control subjects. Plasma RNase and nuclease activity were examined, in relation to different substrates-TLRs response modifiers, and circulating RNA and oligonucleotides were isolated. The fall in enzyme activity in plasma was obtained for rRNA, poly(C), poly(U), poly(I:C), poly(A:U) and CpG, especially in juvenile diabetics. In order to test the non-enzymatic glycation, commercial RNase (E.C.3.1.27.5) and control plasma samples were incubated with increasing glucose concentrations (5, 10, 20 and 50 mmol/l). The fall of enzyme activity was expressed more significantly in control plasma samples than for the commercial enzyme. Total amount of purified plasma RNA and oligonucleotides was significantly higher in diabetic patients, especially in juvenile diabetics. The increase in the concentration of nucleotides corresponded to the peak absorbance at 270 nm, similar to polyC. The electrophoretic bands shared similar characteristics between controls and each type of diabetic patients, except that the bands were more expressed in diabetic patients. Decreased RNase activity and related increase of circulating oligonucleotides may favor the increase of nucleic acid "danger motifs", leading to TLRs activation.
