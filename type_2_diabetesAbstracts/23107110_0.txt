 AIMS: An appropriate questionnaire for assessing family support of self-management behavior of Japanese Type 2 diabetes patients has yet to be developed. We produced a Japanese version of the Diabetes Family Behavior Checklist (DFBC) and tested its reliability and validity. METHODS: The study enrolled Japanese patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who were living with their families: 158 patients in the Insulin Group and 169 in the Oral Hypoglycemic Agents Group. The external validity of the DFBC was tested with questionnaires of self-managed dietary and exercise behaviors, the Appraisal of Diabetes Scale (ADS), and HbA1c. RESULTS: The DFBC comprised two components: "Negative" and "Positive" feedbacks. Cronbach's alpha in the subcategories was ≥0.93, and the test-retest showed an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.89. "Positive" and "Negative" scores correlated with self-managed dietary and/or exercise behaviors, the ADS scores in the both Groups. For patients having HbA1c levels of ≤6.8% there was a correlation between their "Positive" and "Negative" scores and the scores of their families in both Groups. CONCLUSION: The DFBC showed evidence of validity and reliability and may be a useful tool for quick assessment of self-managed treatment behavior of Japanese Type 2 diabetes patients and support received from their family.
