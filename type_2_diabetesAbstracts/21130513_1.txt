A randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects multiple-doses (28 days) dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor PF-734200 on DPP-IV activity, glucose, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon and insulin levels in 72 subjects with type 2 diabetes. The relationship between changes in active GLP-1 and glucose during a meal test appeared non-linear.
