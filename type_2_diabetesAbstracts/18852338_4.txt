 OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in the quality of care in Norway for patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two cross-sectional surveys were examined that identified all patients (n = 1,470 in 1995 and n = 2,699 in 2005) with type 2 diabetes attending 33 general practices in 1995 and 2005. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2005, there were significant improvements in the proportion of patients for whom important laboratory analyses, smoking habits, height, weight, and referral to eye examination were recorded. Mean A1C declined from 7.74 to 7.15%, systolic blood pressure from 150.0 to 140.4 mmHg, and cholesterol from 6.28 to 5.0 mmol/l (P < 0.001, age and sex adjusted). The 10-year risk of coronary heart disease for an average male patient declined from 42 to 29%. CONCLUSIONS: There have been substantial improvements in type 2 diabetes primary care in Norway that are potentially related to major improvements in health outcomes.
