 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in diabetic subjects without prior evidence of CHD is equal to that in nondiabetic subjects with prior myocardial infarction or any prior evidence of CHD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During an 18-year follow-up total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CHD deaths were registered in a Finnish population-based study of 1,373 nondiabetic and 1,059 diabetic subjects. RESULTS: Adjusted multivariate Cox hazard models indicated that diabetic subjects without prior myocardial infarction, compared with nondiabetic subjects with prior myocardial infarction, had a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.9 (95% CI 0.6-1.5) for the risk of CHD death. The corresponding HR was 0.9 (0.5-1.4) in men and 1.9 (0.6 -6.1) in women. Diabetic subjects without any prior evidence of CHD (myocardial infarction or ischemic electrocardiogram [ECG] changes or angina pectoris), compared with nondiabetic subjects with prior evidence of CHD, had an HR of 1.9 (1.4-2.6) for CHD death (men 1.5 [1.0-2.2]; women 3.5 [1.8-6.8]). The results for CVD and total mortality were quite similar to those for CHD mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes without prior myocardial infarction and prior myocardial infarction without diabetes indicate similar risk for CHD death in men and women. However, diabetes without any prior evidence of CHD (myocardial infarction or angina pectoris or ischemic ECG changes) indicates a higher risk than prior evidence of CHD in nondiabetic subjects, especially in women.
