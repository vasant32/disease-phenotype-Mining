Achieving tight glycaemic control remains an unmet need for many patients with type 2 diabetes, despite improved treatments. To meet glycaemic targets, attempts have been made to improve existing drugs and to develop new classes of drugs. Recent advances include insulin analogues that more closely mimic physiologic insulin levels, and incretin-based therapies, which capitalize on the glucoregulatory properties of native glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Although promising, these agents are associated with limitations, including hypoglycaemia with insulin, gastrointestinal adverse events with GLP-1 receptor agonists and frequent dosing with both classes. Albumin is an abundant natural drug carrier that has been used to improve the half-life, tolerability and efficacy of a number of bioactive agents. Here, we review the physiologic roles of albumin and how albumin technologies are being used to prolong duration of action of therapies for diabetes, including insulin and incretin-based therapies.
