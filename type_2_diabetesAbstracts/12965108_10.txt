This multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the efficacy of acarbose in Chinese individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (determined using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test). Subjects were randomised to either placebo or acarbose 50 mg t.i.d. for a period of 16 weeks. Primary efficacy variables were the maximum postprandial plasma glucose value (C(max)) and the serum insulin profile. Secondary efficacy parameters included postprandial glucose profile, maximum postprandial insulin concentration (C(max)), changes in lipid profile and blood pressure and HbA(1c) and body weight and conversion to Type 2 diabetes. In the intention-to-treat analysis, acarbose treatment resulted in significantly higher reductions in postprandial glucose and serum insulin concentrations compared to placebo. Triglyceride concentration was the only lipid parameter to be significantly reduced in acarbose subjects. Loss of body weight was also significantly greater for acarbose than placebo subjects. Some 19 individuals converted to Type 2 diabetes (seven acarbose, 12 placebo), but this difference was not significant. Acarbose is efficacious in improving the metabolic state of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance indicating a potential benefit for the delay or prevention of onset of Type 2 diabetes in Chinese subjects.
