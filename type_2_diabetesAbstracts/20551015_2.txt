 OBJECTIVE: To explore the hypothesis that CD36, a scavenger receptor and fatty acid translocase, is upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) among patients with type 2 diabetes and is a biomarker of PBMC activation and inflammation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a cross-sectional observational design to study a multi-racial/ethnic population sample consisting of Caucasians, Hispanics, and Native Americans with type 2 diabetes (n = 33) and nondiabetic control subjects (n = 27). PBMC CD36 mRNA/protein and plasma high sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (hsCRP), hs-interleukin-6 (hsIL-6), and adiponectin were measured. RESULTS: Unadjusted PBMC CD36 mRNA and protein were 1.56- and 1.63-fold higher, respectively, among type 2 diabetic subjects versus control subjects. PBMC CD36 protein was directly associated with CD36 mRNA, plasma hsCRP, and hsIL-6 and inversely associated with plasma adiponectin in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CD36 expression is a biomarker of PBMC activation and inflammation and may become a useful tool in cardiovascular disease risk stratification.
