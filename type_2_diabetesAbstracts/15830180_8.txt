AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetic distal symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) affects 20-30% of diabetic patients. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and electrical spinal cord stimulation have been proposed as physical therapies. We performed a controlled, randomised pilot trial to compare the effects of high-frequency external muscle stimulation (HF) with those of TENS in patients with symptomatic DSP. METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes and DSP (n=41) were randomised to receive treatment with TENS or HF using strata for non-painful (n=20) and painful sensory symptoms (n=21). Both lower extremities were treated for 30 min daily for three consecutive days. The patients' degree of symptoms and pain were graded daily on a scale of one to ten, before, during and 2 days after treatment termination. Responders were defined by the alleviation of one or more symptoms by at least three points. RESULTS: The two treatment groups were similar in terms of baseline characteristics, such as age, duration of diabetes, neurological symptoms scores and neurological disability scores. The responder rate was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the HF group (80%, 16 out of 20) than in the TENS group (33%, seven out of 21). Subgroup analysis revealed that HF was more effective than TENS in relieving the symptoms of non-painful neuropathy (HF: 100%, seven out of seven; TENS: 44%, four out of nine; p<0.05) and painful neuropathy (HF: 69%, nine out of 13; TENS: 25%, three out of 12; p<0.05). The responders did not differ in terms of the reduction in mean symptom intensity during the trial. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This pilot study shows, for the first time, that HF can ameliorate the discomfort and pain associated with DSP, and suggests that HF is more effective than TENS. External muscle stimulation offers a new therapeutic option for DSP.
