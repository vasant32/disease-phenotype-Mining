Obesity is associated with an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, respiratory dysfunction, and certain forms of cancer. Insulin resistance in many type 2 diabetic patients is the result of increased visceral adiposity. To identify novel genes implicated in type 2 diabetes and/or obesity and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying both diseases, we analyzed gene expression in omental fat from lean and obese nondiabetic subjects and obese type 2 diabetic patients using mRNA differential display and subtracted library techniques. After screening over 13,800 subtracted cDNA clones and 6,912 cDNA amplification products, we identified 2,078 cDNAs that showed potential differential expression in the omental fat of lean versus obese nondiabetic subjects versus obese type 2 diabetic patients. Data analysis showed that 70.7% of these clones corresponded to unknown genes (26.7% matched express sequence tags [ESTs]) and 29.3% corresponded to known genes. Reverse Northern and classic Northern analyses further confirmed that the expression of five of these cDNA clones was elevated in obese nondiabetic subjects and obese type 2 diabetic patients. Four candidate genes were further evaluated for tissue distribution, which showed expression primarily in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue, and chromosomal localization. We concluded that both mRNA differential display and subtracted cDNA libraries are powerful tools for identifying novel genes implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
