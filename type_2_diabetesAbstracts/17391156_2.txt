BACKGROUND: The worldwide increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity is reaching epidemic proportions and is associated with a dramatic rise in cases of type 2 diabetes. We determined the prevalence of impaired glucose regulation and insulin resistance in obese children and adolescents. METHODS: A total of 196 obese children [SD score (SDS) of body mass index (BMI): 2.17 +/- 0.03], aged 7-18 years, including 86 male subjects, underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (1.75 g glucose/kg body weight). We used the modified WHO criteria adapted for children for abnormal glucose homeostasis. Homeostasis model assessment was used to estimate insulin resistance in all subjects. The insulin sensitivity index was also determined in subjects. RESULTS: Of the total of 196 obese children, 15 (6.6%) had an abnormal fasting glucose level. Of the 196 obese children, 35 (18%) had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 83 (43%) had insulin resistance. Of the 196 obese children were six (3%) diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance indices were correlated well with the degree of abnormal glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: IGT, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are far more common in obese Turkish children than previously thought. Early treatment in obese children and adolescents with IGT constitutes a strategy of reversing the progression to beta-cell failure and preventing type 2 diabetes.
