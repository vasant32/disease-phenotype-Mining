 OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of oolong tea for lowering plasma glucose in type 2 diabetic patients in Miaoli, Taiwan. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 20 free-living subjects who had type 2 diabetes and took hyperglycemic drugs as prescribed were enrolled in the present study. Subjects consumed oolong tea (1,500 ml) or water for 30 days each in a randomized crossover design. Tea was not consumed for 14 days prior to treatments. RESULTS: Relative to initial concentrations, oolong tea markedly lowered concentrations of plasma glucose (from 229 +/- 53.9 to 162.2 +/- 29.7 mg/dl, P < 0.001) and fructosamine (from 409.9 +/- 96.1 to 323.3 +/- 56.4 micromol/l, P < 0.01), whereas the water control group had not changed (208.7 +/- 61.0 vs. 232.3 +/- 63.1 mg/dl for glucose and from 368.4 +/- 85.0 to 340.0 +/- 76.1 micromol/l for fructosamine). CONCLUSIONS: Oolong tea may be an effective adjunct to oral hypoglycemic agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
