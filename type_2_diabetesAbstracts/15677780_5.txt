 OBJECTIVE: To examine patients' views of the acceptability of and satisfaction with telephone care center support provided to improve blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Pro-Active Call-Center Treatment Support (PACCTS) Trial randomized patients from 47 general practices in a deprived urban area in northwest England to usual care or to proactive call center support in addition to usual care. Satisfaction with care was assessed in all 591 patients at baseline and the end of the study using the Diabetes Satisfaction and Treatment Questionnaire (DTSQ). Acceptability was assessed in 394 intervention patients after at least three proactive calls from the call center and at the end of the trial. A purposive sample of 25 patients took part in in-depth semistructured interviews. RESULTS: The response rates to the questionnaires were 79% (DTSQ) and 65% (acceptability). Persons receiving the intervention continued to report high levels of satisfaction with their treatment (95% CI 32.3-33.2 at 1 year), and >90% strongly agreed or agreed that the telecarer approach was acceptable. Qualitative comments pointed to the importance of a personalized service; increased feelings of well-being, including confidence and self-control; help with problem-solving; and patients developing rapport and a strong bond with the telecarers. CONCLUSIONS: A personalized PACCTS approach is acceptable to patients. A service giving priority to the interpersonal dimension leads to increased commitment from patients to improve long-term glycemic control.
