Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the commonest endocrine disorder in women, is characterized by an altered steroid milieu and is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes gene product (Ped/pea-15) regulates glucose metabolism and is increased in T2DM. Our novel data indicate that Ped/pea-15 mRNA expression and protein levels are significantly increased in omental adipose tissue (AT) from PCOS women compared to matched controls (p < 0.01); Ped/pea-15 levels in subcutaneous AT were not significantly different. Furthermore, Ped/pea-15 mRNA expression and protein levels were higher in omental compared to subcutaneous AT in PCOS subjects (p < 0.01); however, in control subjects, this was not significant. Glucose was predictive of omental AT Ped/pea-15 mRNA expression (p = 0.045). Importantly, glucose and insulin increased whereas metformin significantly decreased Ped/pea-15 levels in human omental AT explants. Our findings should serve to promote further research on Ped/pea-15 biology.
