 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between fruit, vegetable, and fruit juice intake and development of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 71,346 female nurses aged 38-63 years who were free of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes in 1984 were followed for 18 years, and dietary information was collected using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire every 4 years. Diagnosis of diabetes was self-reported. RESULTS: During follow-up, 4,529 cases of diabetes were documented, and the cumulative incidence of diabetes was 7.4%. An increase of three servings/day in total fruit and vegetable consumption was not associated with development of diabetes (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio 0.99 [95% CI 0.94-1.05]), whereas the same increase in whole fruit consumption was associated with a lower hazard of diabetes (0.82 [0.72-0.94]). An increase of 1 serving/day in green leafy vegetable consumption was associated with a modestly lower hazard of diabetes (0.91 [0.84-0.98]), whereas the same change in fruit juice intake was associated with an increased hazard of diabetes (1.18 [1.10-1.26]). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of green leafy vegetables and fruit was associated with a lower hazard of diabetes, whereas consumption of fruit juices may be associated with an increased hazard among women.
