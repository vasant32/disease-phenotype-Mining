 OBJECTIVE: Recently, much attention has been paid to the possibility that postprandial hyperglycemia may be a cardiovascular risk factor in diabetes. Oxidative stress has been involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, and increased plasma levels of nitrotyrosine, a product of peroxynitrite action, have been found in the plasma of diabetic subjects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether postprandial hyperglycemia is accompanied by nitrotyrosine generation and, if so, to explore a possible direct role of hyperglycemia in such a phenomenon. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 23 type 2 diabetic patients and 15 matched normal healthy subjects were recruited for this study. Two different tests were performed in diabetic patients: a standard meal preceded by regular insulin (0.15 units/kg body wt) or insulin aspart (0.15 units/kg body wt) to achieve different levels of postprandial hyperglycemia. The meal test was also performed in healthy control subjects. At 0 min and 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after each meal, blood glucose, triglyceride, and nitrotyrosine levels were measured. RESULTS: Fasting nitrotyrosine was significantly increased in diabetic patients and was further increased during both meal tests in diabetic subjects but not normal subjects. As compared with regular insulin, aspart administration significantly reduced the area under the curve of both glycemia (P < 0.04) and nitrotyrosine (P < 0.03), whereas that of triglycerides was not significantly affected by the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a direct correlation between postprandial hyperglycemia and the production of nitrotyrosine, a marker of oxidative stress, in patients with type 2 diabetes.
