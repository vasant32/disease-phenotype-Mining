 AIM: The fatty acid-binding protein 2 (FABP2) A54T polymorphism has been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity in many but not all studies. Our aim was to investigate possible associations of FABP2 A54T polymorphism with T2DM and/or obesity in a Greek Caucasian population. METHODS: 242 subjects with T2DM and 188 control subjects were genotyped for the FABP2 A54T polymorphism using PCR-RFLP method. Of the total subjects included in both groups, 172 were classified as obese (BMI >or= 30 kg/m(2)) and 258 were classified as nonobese (BMI <30 kg/m(2)). RESULTS: In the whole population, 218 subjects (50.7%) were genotyped as AA, 175 subjects (40.7%) as AT, and 37 subjects (8.6%) as TT for the FABP2 A54T polymorphism. According to the dominant model, the frequency of AA genotype was significantly lower in obese than in nonobese subjects (43.0% vs 55.8%, p=0.009). No significant difference was observed in genotypes between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. According to the additive model, the presence of TT genotype was significantly associated with obesity after adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of T2DM (OR 2.32, p=0.028). CONCLUSION: FABP2 A54T polymorphism may help identify Caucasian subjects at risk for obesity.
