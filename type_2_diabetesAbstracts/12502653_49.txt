 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether non-HDL cholesterol, a measure of total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol, is a predictor of CVD in patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Strong Heart Study, a population-based study of CVD and its risk factors in 13 American Indian communities in three geographic areas in the U.S. The baseline examination, conducted between July 1989 and January 1992, consisted of a personal interview, a physical examination, and laboratory tests. Of the 4,549 women and men aged 45-74 years participating in the study, 2,108 had diabetes but no CVD at baseline. Data on fatal and nonfatal CVD were collected during the follow-up period through 31 December 1998 (average 9 years). RESULTS: Multivariable analyses indicated that non-HDL cholesterol is a strong predictor of CVD in men and women with diabetes and is particularly indicative of coronary events. Hazard ratios for the highest tertile of non-HDL cholesterol in men and women with diabetes (2.23 and 1.80, respectively) were higher than those for either LDL cholesterol or triglycerides alone in both men and women and were higher than the ratio of total/HDL cholesterol in women. The utility of non-HDL cholesterol in predicting CVD extended over a wide range of triglyceride concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that non-HDL cholesterol index may be particularly useful in predicting CVD risk in patients with diabetes.
