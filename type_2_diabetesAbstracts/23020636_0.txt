Cardiovascular disease remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This article examines the recent evidence from trials and related meta-analyses on the effects of glycaemic control on cardiovascular disease (and, to a lesser extent, microvascular outcomes) in diabetes, and compares this with evidence accrued from blood pressure and statin trials. On the basis of such evidence, as well as pragmatic considerations, it is clear that clinicians should place stronger emphasis on lipid and blood pressure management to lessen cardiovascular risks. At the same time, cardiovascular disease benefits of glycaemia reduction appear less pronounced, with patient characteristics critically influencing risk to benefit ratio. Recent guidelines now reflect recent observations on glycaemic control (with relaxed targets in specific patient groups), whereas future guidelines should encourage physicians to prioritize lipid-lowering and blood pressure management in patients with diabetes.
