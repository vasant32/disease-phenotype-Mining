 OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of high-intensity progressive resistance training (PRT) on glycemic control in older adults with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a 16-week randomized controlled trial in 62 Latino older adults (40 women and 22 men; mean +/- SE age 66 +/- 8 years) with type 2 diabetes randomly assigned to supervised PRT or a control group. Glycemic control, metabolic syndrome abnormalities, body composition, and muscle glycogen stores were determined before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Sixteen weeks of PRT (three times per week) resulted in reduced plasma glycosylated hemoglobin levels (from 8.7 +/- 0.3 to 7.6 +/- 0.2%), increased muscle glycogen stores (from 60.3 +/- 3.9 to 79.1 +/- 5.0 mmol glucose/kg muscle), and reduced the dose of prescribed diabetes medication in 72% of exercisers compared with the control group, P = 0.004-0.05. Control subjects showed no change in glycosylated hemoglobin, a reduction in muscle glycogen (from 61.4 +/- 7.7 to 47.2 +/- 6.7 mmol glucose/kg muscle), and a 42% increase in diabetes medications. PRT subjects versus control subjects also increased lean mass (+1.2 +/- 0.2 vs. -0.1 +/- 0.1 kg), reduced systolic blood pressure (-9.7 +/- 1.6 vs. +7.7 +/- 1.9 mmHg), and decreased trunk fat mass (-0.7 +/- 0.1 vs. +0.8 +/- 0.1 kg; P = 0.01-0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PRT as an adjunct to standard of care is feasible and effective in improving glycemic control and some of the abnormalities associated with the metabolic syndrome among high-risk older adults with type 2 diabetes.
