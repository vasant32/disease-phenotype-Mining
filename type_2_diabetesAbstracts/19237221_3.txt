 AIMS: Demonstrate the influence of type 2 diabetes control on the degree of retinal endothelial damage (vWF, E-selectin) and local increases in the concentrations of selected adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin) in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). METHODS: Vitreous and serum samples were collected during vitrectomy from 19 patients with PDR and 15 patients who underwent vitrectomy for other reasons. Tests were performed using the ELISA method. RESULTS: Serum and intraocular concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, vWF were considerably higher in the subjects with PDR than in the controls. In the vitreous, the increase in vWF depended on the elevated levels of vWF in the serum (r=0.905, p<0.001). E-selectin correlated with diastolic blood pressure (r=0.506, p=0.045). The concentrations of vWF and E-selectin in both samples were related to the significant increases in intraocular ICAM-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 in the serum of PDR patients. Increased VCAM-1 level in the vitreous correlated with the concentration of HbA(1)c (r=0.59, p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Upon local and systemic damage to the endothelium there were significant increases in ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin. A significant positive correlation of VCAM-1 increase in the vitreous with HbA(1)c is an important argument for the influence of diabetes on immuno-inflammatory activation in the retinal microcirculation.
