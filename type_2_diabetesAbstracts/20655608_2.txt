This study aimed at identifying predictors of success (retention after one year of intervention with ≥5% weight loss) in subjects at high risk for type 2 diabetes enrolled in a lifestyle modification program. Fifty-one individuals with BMI ≥27kg/m(2) and pre-diabetes or metabolic syndrome were enrolled in an individualized multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention to induce weight loss. Subjects were assessed initially with a 16-item weight-loss readiness tool (WLRT) based on stages of change model; a 6-min walk test; and anthropometric measures. The most significant independent factor associated with no success was a lower result to the question "I am capable of doing more physical activity" (P=0.001). The second significant independent predictor was ≤0.5% weight loss 6 weeks after initiating intervention (P=0.01). Excluding subjects with both criteria would have reduced by 52% the number of subjects eligible for the program, decreased the dropout rate from 30% to 17%, and increased the proportion of subjects with ≥5% weight loss at one year from 51% to 80%. Importantly, only 4% of subjects would have been falsely identified as non-responders. These results indicate that a practical WLRT, in combination with early weight-loss response, is helpful to identify subjects with greater chances of success to lifestyle intervention.
