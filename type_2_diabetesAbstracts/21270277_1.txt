 OBJECTIVE: Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed that a 9p21.3 locus was associated with type 2 diabetes. In this study, we carried out a large-scale case-control study in the GeneID Chinese Han population to 1) further replicate the association of 9p21.3 type 2 diabetes GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2) assess the association of these SNPs with coronary artery disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Three SNPs (rs2383208, rs10811661, and rs10757283) were genotyped in two GeneID cohorts of 3,167 Chinese Han individuals. Case-control association design was used to determine the association of the SNPs with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. Gensini scores were calculated in the coronary artery disease subjects and were tested for association with the variants. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed on association studies. RESULTS: The association between two of the three SNPs and type 2 diabetes was replicated in the GeneID population (rs2383208, P = 0.936; rs10811661-T, P = 0.02, odds ratio [OR] = 1.23; rs10757283-C, P = 0.003, OR = 1.30). The same two SNPs also contributed to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (rs10811661-T, P = 0.002, OR = 1.19; rs10757283-C, P = 0.003, OR = 1.18). In addition, rs10757283 was associated with severity of coronary atherosclerosis estimated by the Gensini scoring system (risk allele C, quantitative-trait regression adjusted P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time to our knowledge, our results indicated that the same 9p21.3 locus, represented by SNPs rs10811661 and rs10757283, contributed to the risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease in our GeneID Chinese Han population.
