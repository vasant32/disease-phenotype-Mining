Thirty-nine hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were followed under long-term treatment (mean, 20.7 months) with manidipine hydrochloride, a Ca antagonist, or delapril hydrochloride, an ACE inhibitor, at nine institutions. Both the treatments showed similar antihypertensive effects, although slight but significantly larger decreases were observed in systolic and mean blood pressures at months 12 and 24 in the patients treated with manidipine (P < 0.02). The urinary albumin excretion index (AEI) tended to increase throughout the study in both treatment groups, but no significant difference in AEI was observed between the two treatment groups at any time point. Overt albuminuria developed in four patients on manidipine but did not appear in any of the patients on delapril. The risk of progression to overt albuminuria was significantly different between manidipine and delapril groups (P = 0.011). No increase in serum creatinine (Cr) was observed with delapril. The average excretion indexes of tubular markers such as beta2-microglobulin, alpha1-microglobulin, and NAG tended to be higher in the patients on manidipine than in those on delapril. Taken in sum, these findings suggest that the ACE inhibitor delapril is more beneficial than the Ca antagonist manidipine in the treatment of diabetic renal diseases via mechanisms other than the blood pressure regulation, partly through their different effects on tubular function. In conclusion, delapril was significantly more effective than manidipine in inhibiting progression to overt albuminuria in hypertensive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
