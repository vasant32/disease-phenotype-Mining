Type 2 diabetic patients present high triglyceride and low HDL levels, significant determinants for the risk of atherosclerosis. Transgenic mice overproducing human apolipoprotein (apo)A-II, one of the two major apos of HDLs, display the same lipid disorders. Here, we investigated the possible regulation of apoA-II gene expression by glucose. In primary rat hepatocytes and in HepG2 cells, the transcription of the human apoA-II gene was upregulated by glucose. This response was mediated by a hormone-responsive element within the enhancer of the apoA-II promoter and was dependent on hepatocyte nuclear factor-4alpha. Accordingly, in transgenic mice, the human apoA-II gene is stimulated by a high-carbohydrate diet after fasting and at weaning. By contrast, the apoA-II mRNA level is not modified in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. In transgenic mice overexpressing the human apoA-II gene, plasma human apoA-II concentration was positively correlated with blood glucose levels. These mice displayed a marked delay in plasma glucose tolerance as compared with control mice. We hypothesize that the following pathogenic pathway might occur in the course of type 2 diabetes: increased apoA-II level causes a rise in plasma triglyceride level and glucose intolerance, resulting in hyperglycemia, which in turn might further increase apoA-II gene transcription.
