 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to compare the effect of physical exercise program on the endothelial function of patients with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Patients were randomized for high intensity aerobic training (HI: 80% maximum heart rate, n=10), low intensity aerobic training (LI: 55% of maximum heart rate, n=10) and control (n=11). Before and after 6 weeks of training, subjects performed the maximal exercise test and a study of the endothelial function, through a high resolution ultrasound of the brachial artery, which was assessed after reactive hyperemia (endothelium dependent vasodilation) and nitrate administration (endothelium independent vasodilation). RESULTS: A total of 31 patients with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus were studied, with mean age of 58±6 years, The percentage diameter difference of the vessel after hyperemia was significantly higher for the high intensity group (HI before 2.52±2.85% and after 31.81±12.21%; LI before 3.23±3.52% and after 20.61±7.76%; controls before 3.56±2.33% and after 2.43±2.14%; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High intensity aerobic training improved the functional capability and endothelium dependent vasodilator response, but it does not improve the endothelium independent vasodilation in patients with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
