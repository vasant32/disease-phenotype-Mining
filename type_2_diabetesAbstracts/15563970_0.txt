As a westernized lifestyle becomes widespread in Japan, the number of individuals with obesity, as well as type 2 diabetes, is rapidly increasing. In this investigation, we studied the prevalence of obesity and its association with the development of diabetic macroangiopathy and microangiopathy. The clinical records of 634 patients in our hospital with type 2 diabetes were surveyed. The relationship between obesity and diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy and macroangiopathy (carotid artery intima-media thickness, IMT) was examined using univariate and multivariate analysis. A body mass index (BMI) > or = 25 kg/m2 was used as the diagnostic criterion for obesity. The prevalence of obesity at the time of the survey was 35% and a history of obesity was reported in 70% of the survey population. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the maximum BMI was significantly correlated with IMT thickening. The prevalence of nephropathy in previously obese patients was significantly higher than in non-obese patients. The maximum BMI was significantly associated with the development of retinopathy and nephropathy, as shown by logistic regression analysis. This suggests that a history of obesity may be an important risk factor for the development of micro- and macroangiopathy in Japanese with type 2 diabetes.
