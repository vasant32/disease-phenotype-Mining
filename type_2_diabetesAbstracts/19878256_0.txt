Obesity is associated with increased insulin resistance and is a well-recognized factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, most diabetes therapies are associated with further weight gain, a most unwelcome characteristic, given the association of weight gain with deteriorating metabolic control, worsening cardiovascular profiles and decreased adherence to treatment. Therapies that effectively control glycaemia without weight gain or with concomitant weight loss are needed. The aim of this article was to review the existing preclinical and clinical evidences, showing that the family of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies fulfils these criteria by harnessing the beneficial properties of GLP-1, a naturally occurring incretin hormone with a strong blood glucose-lowering action and the ability to induce weight loss.
