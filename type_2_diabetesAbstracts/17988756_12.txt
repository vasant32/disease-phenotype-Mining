 OBJECTIVE: Investigate the effectiveness of an educational intervention that used both the cellular phone with a short messaging service (SMS) and the Internet on the glycemic control of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group and twenty-six to a control group. The intervention was applied for 12 months. The goal of the intervention was to keep blood glucose concentrations close to the normal range (HbA(1)c<7%). Patients in the intervention group were asked to access a website by using a cellular phone or to wiring the Internet and input their blood glucose levels weekly. Participants were sent the optimal recommendations by both cellular phone and the Internet weekly. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group had lower HbA(1)c over 12 months when compared with the control group. At 12 months the change from baseline in HbA(1)c was -1.32 in the intervention group versus +0.81 in the control group. Two hours post-meal glucose (2HPMG) had a significantly greater decline in the intervention group after 12 months when compared with the control group (-100.0 versus +18.1mg/dl). CONCLUSION: This educational intervention using the Internet and a SMS by cellular phone rapidly improved and stably maintained the glycemic control of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
