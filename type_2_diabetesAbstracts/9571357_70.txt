 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether serum lipid intervention, in addition to conventional diabetes treatment, could alter cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 164 type 2 diabetic subjects (117 men, 47 women) without a history of clinical cardiovascular disease randomized to receive either bezafibrate or placebo daily on a double-blind basis in addition to routine diabetes treatment and followed prospectively for a minimum of 3 years. Serial biochemical and noninvasive vascular assessments, carotid and femoral artery B-mode ultrasound measurements, and those pertaining to coronary heart disease (CHD)--clinical history, the World Health Organization (WHO) cardiovascular questionnaire, and resting and exercise electrocardiogram (ECG)--were recorded. RESULTS: Bezafibrate treatment was associated with significantly greater reductions over 3 years in median serum triglyceride (-32 vs. 4%, P = 0.001), total cholesterol (-7 vs. -0.3%, P = 0.004), and total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio (-12 vs. -0.0%, P = 0.001), and an increase in HDL cholesterol (6 vs. -2%, P = 0.02) as compared with placebo. There was a trend toward a greater reduction of fibrinogen (-18 vs. -6%, P = 0.08) at 3 years. No significant differences between the two groups were found in the progress of ultrasonically measured arterial disease. In those treated with bezafibrate, there was a significant reduction (P = 0.01, log-rank test) in the combined incidence of Minnesota-coded probable ischemic change on the resting ECG and of documented myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Improving dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetic subjects had no effect on the progress of ultrasonically measured arterial disease, although the lower rate of "definite CHD events" in the treated group suggests that this might result in a reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease.
