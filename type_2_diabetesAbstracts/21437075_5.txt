Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to rise in prevalence in the United States and worldwide. Despite advances in medical treatments for T2DM, many patients remain uncontrolled. By targeting centrally mediated pathways of glucose metabolism, bromocriptine represents a novel therapeutic option in T2DM. Several small clinical trials demonstrate improvements in insulin resistance and glycemic control. After the submission of data from four recent, large clinical trials, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of bromocriptine in T2DM. We review the available data from these four trials and other published studies. Bromocriptine is a promising therapy for diabetes patients and demonstrates modest improvements in glycemic control.
