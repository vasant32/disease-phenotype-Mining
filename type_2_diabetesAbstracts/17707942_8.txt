 BACKGROUND AND AIM: Skin autofluorescence (AF), which has been proposed as a measure of tissue content of advanced glycation end-products, is a predictor of health outcomes in diabetic patients. Aim of this study is the assessment of parameters associated with increased AF in a sample of type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: AF was determined in a consecutive series of type 2 diabetic 92 patients aged 69.1+/-12.4 years. Univariate and multivariate correlations with several clinical and chemical parameters were assessed. RESULTS: A significant (p<0.01) correlation of AF was found with age (r=0.33) and HbA1c (r=0.34). After adjusting for age and HbA1c, micro- or macrovascular complications of diabetes were associated with higher AF. Furthermore, a higher AF was found in patients with metabolic syndrome (2.7+/-1.0 AU versus 2.2+/-0.7 AU; p<0.05). Waist circumference, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol showed a significant correlation with AF after adjustment for age and HbA1c (adj. r=0.30, 0.29, and -0.27; all p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Skin autofluorescence in type 2 diabetic patients is associated not only with degree of hyperglycaemia and age, but also with adiposity and metabolic syndrome.
