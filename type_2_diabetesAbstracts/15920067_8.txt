 OBJECTIVE: Several studies have shown a bimodal curve in the distribution of glucose in populations with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, but bimodality has not been reported among whites of Northern European ancestry. It is not clear whether this difference reflects the lower prevalence of diabetes, obscuring a second mode, or implies a more fundamental difference between whites and nonwhites. We investigate this issue by studying glucose distributions in older white patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A study of diabetes was conducted among older community-dwelling white residents of a suburban Southern California community between 1984 and 1987. Two-hour plasma glucose data were collected from 2,326 older white men and women aged 23-92. To investigate bimodality of glucose distributions, we fit unimodal and bimodal normal models to 2-h plasma glucose concentrations transformed by the Box-Cox family of transformations. RESULTS: We found that the bimodal normal mixture model fit the data significantly better than the unimodal skewed distribution model for both sexes and all age-groups except those > or =80 years. The cut points separating the two modes were generally within the 11.1- to 13.6-mmol/l range. CONCLUSIONS: The bimodality of glucose distributions among whites, combined with previous findings, indicates that this phenomenon may be universal. A smaller second mode in our study compared with other studies suggests that whites have diabetes susceptibility but may require more obesity to demonstrate it. With increasing obesity in the U.S., the predicted epidemic of diabetes may affect all ethnic groups including whites.
