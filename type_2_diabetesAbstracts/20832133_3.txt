There are different studies about the efficacy and safety and tolerability of thiazolidinediones added to metformin. The reported improved glycemic control with thiazolidinediones use seems to be associated with an increase in weight with an estimated 2-3 kg weight gain suggesting that maybe thiazolidinediones are not safe for the clinical use. Other authors reported that thiazolidinediones give an improvement in the glycemic without giving weight gain. With our review, we want to evaluate the effects of thiazolidinediones plus metformin combination in diabetic patients on the body weight. From the data emerged from our review we can conclude that even if a small increase in mean body weight was observed in patients treated with thiazolidinediones plus metformin therapy, the weight gain was less than previously reported and it was also considerably less than what might have been expected given the large improvements in glycemic control. For these reasons we can safely say that thiazolidinediones in combination with metformin are effective and well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes.
