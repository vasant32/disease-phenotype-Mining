 AIMS: The effect of a cardiovascular rehabilitation program on arterial compliance in type 2 diabetes mellitus with coronary disease was studied. METHODS: Hemodynamic data and arterial compliance were measured with a tonometer (HDI/Pulse wave CR-2000) in coronary artery disease patients with (n=32) and without (n=24) type 2 diabetes before and after a 6-week multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation program. RESULTS: A decrease in heart rate and an increase in stroke volume without significant change in resting cardiac output were obtained in diabetic patients. Arterial compliance of both small and large arteries was significantly increased. In 10 diabetic patients, this increase could be related to an increase in the anti-hypertensive treatment and to the decreased blood pressure. In the 22 remainders, the small artery compliance was significantly increased independently of blood pressure change. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise training as well as optimization of diabetes and dyslipidemia treatment could explain the improvement of arterial compliance. If these changes are long-lasting and if they improve prognosis remains to be evaluated.
