 OBJECTIVE: Hyperglycemia and hypertension are known to be risk factors for the development of proteinuria in patients with diabetes. Little is known, however, about predictors of progression of renal failure in diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated factors affecting progression of renal failure by measuring the doubling of serum creatinine (s-Cr) as an end point in a cohort of 85 type 2 diabetic patients with chronic renal insufficiency/failure (s-Cr >1.5 and <3.7 mg/dl, 61 +/- 11 years old, 51 men and 34 women, mean s-Cr 2.3 +/- 0.6 mg/dl). RESULTS: The survey period (mean +/- SD) was 14.2 +/- 10.8 months. The cumulative incidence of the end point in patients with insulin therapy (n = 41) was significantly lower than that in patients without it (n = 44) (P = 0.0022, P values by log-rank test). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed insulin therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.435, 95% CI 0.252-0.750, P = 0.0027), serum albumin (0.484, 284-0.823, P = 0.0074), mean blood pressure (1.023, 1.004-1.043, P = 0.017), and hemoglobin (0.841, 0.728-0.972, P = 0.0194) to be independent and significant predictors of progression to renal failure, whereas HbA(1c) or serum cholesterol were not. CONCLUSION: In type 2 diabetic patients with renal failure, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, higher mean blood pressure, and lack of use of insulin predict rapid progression of renal failure, but HbA(1c) does not, and insulin therapy may be possibly an indicator of the delay in progression of renal failure.
