 AIMS: To quantify patient-reported rates of hypoglycemia and its association with health-related quality of life (HRQL), treatment satisfaction, and healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: Data were collected from 2006 to 2008 US National Health and Wellness Survey and the Ailment Panel of Lightspeed Online Research, an internet-based questionnaire. Adults (≥ 18 years) with type 2 diabetes taking ≥ 1 oral antidiabetic agent (OAD), but not insulin, were included (n=2074). Multivariate analyses included logistic regression and generalized linear models. RESULTS: Overall, patients who reported experiencing hypoglycemia symptoms (n=286; 13.78%) were significantly more likely to have a lower HRQL on several parameters including: increased limitations on mobility (b=0.66, OR=1.93, p<0.0001) and usual activities (b=0.58, OR=1.78, p<0.0001), increased pain/discomfort (b=0.69, OR=2.00, p<0.0001) and anxiety/depression (b=0.84, OR=2.31, p<0.0001). They also had a lower total treatment satisfaction score as measured by the DiabMedSat tool (b=-7.66, p<0.0001). Self-reported rates of diabetes-related emergency room (b=0.98, p=0.004) and physician visits (b=0.30, p<0.0001) were also higher among these patients. CONCLUSION: Among OAD-treated type 2 diabetes patients, symptoms of hypoglycemia tend to be correlated with significantly lower HRQL, lower treatment satisfaction and higher levels of healthcare resource utilization.
