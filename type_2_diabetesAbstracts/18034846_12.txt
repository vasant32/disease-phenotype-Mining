 AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of insulin detemir in type 2 diabetes patients previously receiving NPH insulin (NPH group, n = 175) or insulin glargine (glargine group, n = 118) in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). METHODS: Patients were transferred to insulin detemir, while the OAD regimen and number of injections remained the same. The incidence of serious adverse drug reactions, including major hypoglycaemia, and haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), fasting glucose, within-patient fasting glucose variability and body weight change were measured at 14 weeks. RESULTS: Glycaemic control improved in both NPH (HbA(1c) = -0.2%, p < 0.05; fasting glucose -1.0 mmol/l, p < 0.0001) and glargine (HbA(1c) = -0.6%, p < 0.0001; fasting glucose -1.4 mmol/l, p < 0.0001) groups, including a reduction in fasting glucose variability (p < 0.01 for both). The incidence of total and nocturnal hypoglycaemia was reduced in both NPH and glargine groups. The incidence of major hypoglycaemia was low and did not change significantly during the follow-up period. Mean body weight was significantly reduced in the NPH (-0.7 kg, p < 0.01) and glargine (-0.5 kg, p < 0.05) groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in type 2 diabetes, transferring from other basal insulins to insulin detemir in combination with OADs was associated with improvements in glycaemic control, which were accompanied by a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia and a reduction in body weight.
