Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is one component of diabetes management. SMBG presents information about current glycemic status and provides the ability to obtain immediate feedback regarding the impact of behavioral and pharmacological interventions on glucose levels. However, SMBG is useful only when the glucose information is understood correctly, data are accurately interpreted, and results prompt appropriate therapeutic actions. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recently published guidelines for SMBG use in non-insulin treated people with diabetes, recommending that SMBG should be used only when patients and/or their clinicians possess the ability and willingness to incorporate SMBG monitoring and therapy adjustment into their diabetes care plan. If SMBG is used, the IDF also recommends that structured SMBG be performed utilizing defined regimens to meet individual needs. Structured SMBG can be performed as daily glucose profiles that are representative of daily glucose excursions. Measuring preprandial/postprandial blood glucose (bG) levels on consecutive or alternating days ("testing in pairs") also provides impactful glucose information for daily diabetes management. This article reviews recent studies that appropriately utilized structured SMBG as an integral component of comprehensive diabetes management and discusses how their findings support the IDF recommendations. Our goal is to help clinicians make more informed decisions about the value and utility of SMBG in diabetes management.
