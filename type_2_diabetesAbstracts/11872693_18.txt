Resistin is a novel polypeptide specifically secreted from adipocytes, and its serum levels are increased in obese diabetic mice. Resistin antagonizes insulin and could account for insulin resistance. To determine whether there are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the resistin gene associated with type 2 diabetes, sequences for 24 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients were initially analyzed using PCR direct sequencing. Three SNPs were found in the introns, but none were present in the coding regions. The allele frequencies of genomic -167C>T, +157C>T, and +299G>A in 99 Japanese control subjects were determined to be 3.5, 6.6, and 39.4%, respectively. In each pair of these SNPs, linkage disequilibria were found between either -167C>T and +299G>A or +157C>T and +299G>A. A linkage disequilibrium was also detected among -167C>T, +157C>T, and +299G>A, and only four of the eight possible haplotypes defined by these SNPs were found. A comparison of the frequencies of these SNPs and haplotypes between 99 type 2 diabetes and 99 control subjects revealed no evidence for any association. These identified SNPs, which were in linkage disequilibrium, represent potentially useful tools for searching for their association with specific phenotypes of diabetes.
