We investigated the relationship between advanced diabetic retinopathy (ADR) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism in subjects with type 2 diabetes and ADR, pre-proliferative (PrePDR) or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) without overt nephropathy. Polymerase chain reactions were used to detect insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms of the ACE gene. There was no difference in the frequency of II, ID, or DD genotypes, or of I and D alleles among subjects with type 2 diabetes without diabetic retinopathy (NDR) or with simple diabetic retinopathy (SDR) and non-diabetic controls. There was also no difference in the frequency of ACE genotypes among subjects with type 2 diabetes with NDR, or SDR and ADR. However, the frequency of the ACE DD genotype in ADR was significantly higher than that in controls (chi(2)=6.64, P=0.036). On the other hand, the frequency of the D allele in ADR was significantly higher than that in controls (chi(2)=6.33, P=0.012), NDR (chi(2)=4.18, P=0.041) and SDR (chi(2)=4. 89, P=0.027), respectively. These results indicate a significant relationship between the presence of the D allele polymorphism in the ACE gene and ADR in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes and no overt nephropathy.
