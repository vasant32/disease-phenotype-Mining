Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of type 2 diabetes mellitus that is characterized by impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells. We previously reported that heterozygous mutations of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha gene cause a form of MODY (MODY3). We have subsequently found that collectrin, a recently cloned kidney-specific gene of unknown function, is a novel target of HNF-1alpha in pancreatic beta-cells. In addition, we have demonstrated that collectrin forms a complex with the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex by direct interaction with snapin, a protein that is thought to be involved in neurotransmission by binding to synaptosomal-associated protein, 25 KD (SNAP25). Collectrin favours the formation of SNARE complexes and controls insulin exocytosis.
