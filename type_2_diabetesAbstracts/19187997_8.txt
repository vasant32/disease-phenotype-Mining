To examine the serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (AG) levels as a surrogate measure of postprandial hyperglycemia (PPH) and insulin secretion in a wide range of hyperglycemia, we compared the relationship between the glycemic index during a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the insulinogenic index and 1,5-AG according the overall glycemic state. Fasting serum 1,5-AG levels were lower in the type 2 diabetic group (18.0+/-7.0microg/mL) than in the normal glucose tolerance (NGT, 25.4+/-4.0microg/mL), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, 24.6+/-6.2microg/mL), and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, 22.1+/-6.2microg/mL) groups and were clearly correlated with glycemic values from the OGTT. 120-min post-challenge plasma glucose (PPG(120)) emerged as an independent predictor for 1,5-AG levels after multiple linear regression analysis (beta=-0.554, P<0.001). Additionally, 1,5-AG levels were significantly correlated with PPG(120) in each quartile of A1C, and the coefficients increased with higher A1C quartiles. Subjects with low 1,5-AG levels had both increased insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion. Decreased 1,5-AG levels are closely correlated with PPH and decreased insulin secretion capacity across a wide range of glycemia, even in relatively well-controlled diabetes.
