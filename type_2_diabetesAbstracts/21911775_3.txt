 OBJECTIVE: To address whether glucose tolerance status, and in particular 1-h postload plasma glucose levels, may affect diastolic function in 161 never-treated hypertensive white subjects. Impaired left ventricular relaxation, an early sign of diastolic dysfunction, represents the first manifestation of myocardial involvement in diabetic cardiomyopathy. A plasma glucose value ≥155 mg/dL for the 1-h postload plasma glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is able to identify subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at high risk for type 2 diabetes and with subclinical organ damage. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects underwent OGTT and standard echocardiography. Diastolic function was assessed by pulsed Doppler transmitral flow velocity and tissue Doppler imaging. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by Matsuda index. RESULTS: Among the participants, 120 had NGT, 26 had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 15 had type 2 diabetes. According to the 1-h postload plasma glucose cutoff point of 155 mg/dL, we divided NGT subjects as follows: NGT <155 mg/dL (n = 90) and NGT ≥155 mg/dL (n = 30). Those with NGT ≥155 mg/dL had higher left atrium dimensions (P < 0.0001) and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) (P = 0.037) than those with NGT <155 mg/dL. By contrast, early/late transmitral flow velocity and all tissue Doppler parameters were significantly lower in those with NGT ≥155 mg/dL than in those with NGT<155 mg/dL. At multiple regression analysis, 1-h glucose was the major determinant of left atrium area, IVRT, septal e', septal e'-to-a' ratio, lateral e', and lateral e'-to-a' ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of this study is that 1-h postload plasma glucose is associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Subjects with NGT ≥155 mg/dL had significantly worse diastolic function than those with NGT<155 mg/dL.
