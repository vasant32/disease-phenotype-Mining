AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To test the hypothesis that adipose tissue lipolysis is enhanced in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, we examined the effect of exercise on regional adipose tissue lipolysis and fatty acid mobilisation and measured the acute effects of exercise on the co-ordination of adipose tissue and splanchnic lipid metabolism. METHODS: Abdominal, subcutaneous adipose tissue and splanchnic lipid metabolism were studied by conducting measurements of arterio-venous concentrations and regional blood flow in six overweight Type 2 diabetic subjects before, during and after exercise. RESULTS: Exercise induced an increase in adipose tissue lipolysis and fatty acid release. However, the increase in adipose tissue blood flow was small, limiting fatty acid mobilisation from this tissue. Some of the fatty acids were released in excess in the post-exercise phase. The splanchnic fatty acid uptake was unchanged during the experiment but splanchnic ketogenesis increased in the post-exercise phase. The arterial glucose concentration decreased during exercise and continued to decrease afterwards, indicating an imbalance between splanchnic glucose production and whole-body glucose utilisation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Regional subcutaneous, abdominal adipose tissue lipolysis is no higher in patients with Type 2 diabetes than in young, healthy subjects. Exercise stimulates adipose tissue lipolysis, but due to an insufficient increase in blood flow, a high fraction of the fatty acids liberated by lipolysis cannot be released to the blood. Splanchnic glucose release is smaller than whole-body glucose utilisation during exercise and post-exercise recovery.
