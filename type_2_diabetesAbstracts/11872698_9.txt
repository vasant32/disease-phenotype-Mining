Associations between type 2 diabetes (and/or parameters contributing to glucose homeostasis) and genetic variation in the genes encoding insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and -2 have been reported in several populations. Recently, it has been reported that the Gly(972)Arg variant in IRS-1 was associated with reduced insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamps in German subjects with normal glucose tolerance. We have examined glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in relation to gene variants in the IRS-1 (Gly(972)Arg) and IRS-2 (Gly(1057)Asp) genes in two Dutch cohorts. Subjects with normal (n = 64) or impaired (n = 94) glucose tolerance underwent 3-h hyperglycemic clamps at 10 mmol/l glucose. All subjects were genotyped for the IRS-1 and IRS-2 variants by PCR-RFLP--based methods. We did not observe any significant difference in both first- and second-phase insulin secretion between carriers and noncarriers of both gene variants, nor was there evidence for an association with other diabetes-related parameters. We conclude that the common gene variants in IRS-1 and IRS-2 are not associated with altered glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in two populations from the Netherlands.
