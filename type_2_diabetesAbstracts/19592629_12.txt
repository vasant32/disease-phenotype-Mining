 OBJECTIVE: LDL cholesterol <2.80 mmol/l was associated with increased cancer risk in type 2 diabetes. We explored the 1) interaction between low LDL cholesterol and albuminuria and 2) interaction between copresence of these two risk factors and statin use for cancer in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed prospective data for 3,793 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients who remained naive for statin treatment and 1,483 patients in whom statin treatment was initiated during a median follow-up period of 5.24 years. All patients were free of cancer at baseline. Biological interactions were estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP), and synergy index (S). RERI > 0, AP > 0, or S > 1 indicates biological interaction. RESULTS: In 3,793 statin-naive type 2 diabetic patients, copresence of low LDL cholesterol and albuminuria increased cancer risk by 2.8-fold (hazard ratio 2.77 [95% CI 1.78-4.31]) with significant biological interactions (RERI 1.05 [0.04-2.06]; AP 0.38 [0.09-0.66]). In the whole cohort of 5,276 type 2 diabetic patients, there was interaction between nonuse of statins and copresence of low LDL cholesterol and albuminuria with increased cancer risk (RERI 2.87 [0.64-5.09] and AP 0.60 [0.29-0.90]). Statin nonusers with LDL cholesterol <2.80 mmol/l and albumunuria had a 4.9-fold risk of cancer compared with statin users with or without both risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes, there was interaction between low LDL cholesterol and albuminuria with increased cancer risks. The latter was attenuated in the presence of statin treatment.
