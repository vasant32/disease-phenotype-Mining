Resistin, specifically secreted from adipocytes, antagonizes insulin and represents a promising candidate gene for type 2 diabetes. We reported that a frequent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) +299G>A in this gene is not associated with type 2 diabetes. To determine whether this SNP affects insulin resistance syndrome associated with type 2 diabetes, we examined its effects on susceptibility to obesity, hyperlipidemia and hypertension in type 2 diabetic subjects and on susceptibility to type 2 diabetes by interaction with other frequent genes involved in lipid metabolism, namely, beta3-adrenergic receptor (b3AR) Trp64Arg, phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B) c.1389G>A or lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) Thr-6Pro. The 99 type 2 diabetic and 99 control subjects were typed by PCR direct sequencing or PCR-RFLP. No differences in frequencies of obesity, hyperlipidemia and hypertension were found between the type 2 diabetic subjects with G/G and those with G/A or A/A genotypes of the resistin SNP. When the combination of the resistin SNP with each of b3AR, PDE3B and LAL SNPs was assessed, no association with type 2 diabetes was evident. Therefore, the frequent SNP +299G>A in the resistin gene is unlikely to have major effects on susceptibility to insulin resistance syndrome associated with type 2 diabetes in Japanese subjects.
