 AIM: The aim of the present study was to determine if micronutrients supplementation can improve neuropathy indices in type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 75 type 2 diabetes patients were assigned to three treatment groups, receiving one of the following daily supplement for 4 months: Group MV: zinc (20 mg), magnesium (250 mg), vitamin C (200 mg) and E (100 mg); Group MVB: both of the above mineral and vitamin supplements plus vitamin B1 (10 mg), B2 (10 mg), B6 (10 mg), biotin (200 μg), B12 (10 μg) and folic acid (1 mg); Group P: placebo. RESULTS: 67 patients completed the study. Neuropathic symptoms based on the MNSI questionnaire improved from 3.45 to 0.64 (p=0.001) in group MVB, from 3.96 to 1.0 (p=0.001) in group MV and from 2.54 to 1.95 in placebo group after 4 months. There was no significant difference between three treatment groups in MNSI examinations after 4 months supplementations. Over 4 months of treatment, patients showed no significant changes in glycemic control, capillary blood flow or electrophysiological measures in MV and MVB groups compared with placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that micronutrients supplementation might ameliorate diabetic neuropathy symptoms.
