Upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family that has been shown to regulate the expression of a raft of key genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. The USF1 gene is located at chromosome 1q22-q23, within the most consistently replicated type 2 diabetes susceptibility locus in the human genome. In this study, we have examined the contribution of eight common USF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to type 2 diabetes susceptibility in the French Caucasian population. None of the USF1 SNPs genotyped, including two SNPs previously associated with familial combined hyperlipidemia (rs2073658 and rs3737787), showed evidence of association with type 2 diabetes. In addition, USF1 SNPs were not associated with plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, or apolipoproteins A1 or B in normoglycemic subjects. A total of four common USF1 haplotypes were identified, accounting for >99% of chromosomes. There was no significant difference in the USF1 haplotype distribution of the case and control subjects. In conclusion, we report here that we were unable to find any evidence to support the hypothesis that genetic variation in the USF1 gene makes a significant contribution to type 2 diabetes susceptibility in the French Caucasian population.
