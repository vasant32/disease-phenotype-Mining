 OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in gene expression in epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) associated with coronary atherosclerosis (CAD) and effects of pioglitazone therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Genes were quantified by RT-PCR in EAT and thoracic subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) obtained during surgery in CAD patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) or type 2 diabetes and control subjects with minimal or no CAD and no MS or type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Increased expression of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-10, a trend for higher IL-1β, and no change in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) was found in EAT from MS or type 2 diabetes. Only PPARγ mRNA was reduced in SAT. Pioglitazone therapy in type 2 diabetes was associated with decreased expression of IL-1β, IL-1Ra, and IL-10 in EAT; decreased IL-10 in SAT; and increased PPARγ in SAT. CONCLUSIONS: In MS and type 2 diabetes with CAD, proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes were differentially increased in EAT and selectively reduced in association with pioglitazone treatment.
