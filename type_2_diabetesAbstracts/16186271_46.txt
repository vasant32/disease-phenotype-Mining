 OBJECTIVE: Gastric bypass and biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) are known to have a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism superior to that of the other bariatric operations. Thanks to its excellent weight loss results and to its specific actions, BPD has proven able to guarantee permanent normalization of serum glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels in the vast majority, if not the totality, of operated patients. However, clinical studies on the duration of these effects in large patient populations are still lacking. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The files of 312 BPD obese patients with type 2 diabetes operated on from June 1984 to January 1993 were examined. Pre- and postoperative serum glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, along with arterial pressure measurements, were considered. RESULTS: After BPD, fasting serum glucose concentration fell within normal values in all but two of the operated subjects and remained in the physiological range in all but six up until 10 years. Serum triglyceride and total cholesterol steadily normalized in all subjects with abnormally high preoperative values, and arterial hypertension disappeared in the vast majority of the preoperatively hypertensive patients. CONCLUSIONS: BPD proved able to reverse all the major components of the metabolic syndrome in nearly all the operated subjects, with results being strictly maintained over a 10-year follow-up period. This outcome, which far exceeds those following similar weight loss at short or long term obtained by any other means, confirms the existence of specific actions of BPD on the major components of metabolic syndrome.
