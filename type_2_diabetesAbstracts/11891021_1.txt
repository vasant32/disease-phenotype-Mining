For the purpose of identifying the features of psychological troubles and their significance in Type 2 diabetes mellitus outpatients, we analyzed how psychological troubles were affected by various background factors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The subjects all consisted of outpatients > or = 40 years of age at the Fukuoka Red Cross Hospital in December 1996. We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to determine anxiety, the Self rating Depression Scale to determine depression. We divided the patients into the ones who demonstrated each specific psychological trouble and the ones who did not, and then analyzed the psychological trouble between the two groups with correlation to various background factors which may have led the patients to develop their respective psychological features. RESULTS: In a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, the presence of itching and polyuria, age (40-49 years old) and females were correlated with anxiety in this study. Depression was also correlated with the absence of photo-coagulation therapy and the absence of leisure time activities. CONCLUSION: Our results identified some of the features of psychological troubles and their significance in diabetic outpatients, It is therefore important to carefully consider these factors during medical consultations.
