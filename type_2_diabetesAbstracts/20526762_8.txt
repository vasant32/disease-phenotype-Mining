 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The apolipoprotein B (ApoB):apolipoprotein A (ApoA)-I ratio may be a better indicator of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with type 2 diabetes than traditional lipid risk markers (LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol), but whether the ApoB:ApoA-I ratio should be used to indicate lipid-lowering therapy is still debated. METHODS: The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study randomised 9,795 patients with type 2 diabetes to fenofibrate (200 mg daily) or placebo and followed them up for a median of 5 years. We compared ApoB, ApoA-I, ApoAII and the ApoB:ApoA-I ratio with traditional lipid variables as predictors of CVD risk. We estimated the HR of the effect of 1 SD difference in baseline concentrations of lipids, apolipoproteins and respective ratios on the risk of CVD events and also used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: In the placebo group, the variables best predicting CVD events were non-HDL-cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol (HR 1.21, p < 0.001 for both), ApoB:ApoA-I (HR 1.20, p < 0.001), LDL-cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol (HR 1.17, p < 0.001), HDL-cholesterol (HR 0.84, p < 0.001) and ApoA-I (HR 0.85, p < 0.001). In the fenofibrate group, the first four predictors were very similar (but ApoB:ApoA-I was fourth), followed by non-HDL-cholesterol and ApoB. Lipid ratios and ApoB:ApoA-I performed better than any single lipid or apolipoprotein in predicting CVD risk. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients with type 2 diabetes in the FIELD study, traditional lipid ratios were as strong as the ApoB:ApoA-I ratio in predicting CVD risk. The data provide little evidence for replacement of traditional lipids and their ratios with measures of ApoB, ApoA-I and their ratio.
