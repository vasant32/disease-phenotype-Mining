Adiponectin is an abundant adipose tissue-derived protein with important metabolic effects. Plasma adiponectin levels are decreased in obese individuals, and low adiponectin levels predict insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Two variants in the adiponectin gene ACDC have been previously associated with plasma adiponectin levels, obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. To determine the role of genetic variation in ACDC in susceptibility to obesity and type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians, we screened the promoter, exons, and exon-intron boundaries of the gene to identify allelic variants. We identified 17 informative polymorphisms that comprised four common (minor allele frequency >15%) linkage disequilibrium clusters consisting of 1-4 variants each. We genotyped one representative polymorphism from each cluster in 1,338 individuals and assessed genotypic association with type 2 diabetes, BMI, serum lipid levels, serum adiponectin levels, and measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion. None of the ACDC variants were associated with type 2 diabetes, BMI, or measures of insulin sensitivity or secretion. One variant, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-12823, was associated with serum adiponectin levels (P = 0.002), but this association explained only 2% of the variance of serum adiponectin levels. Our findings suggest that these common ACDC polymorphisms do not play a major role in susceptibility to obesity or type 2 diabetes in this population.
