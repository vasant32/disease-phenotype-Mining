OBJECTIVESDiabetes is associated with oxidative stress and increased mortality, but a possible correlation between leukocyte-endothelium interactions, oxidative stress, and silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) is yet to be confirmed.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSMitochondrial dysfunction and interactions between leukocytes and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were evaluated in 200 type 2 diabetic patients (25 with SMI) and 60 body composition- and aged-matched control subjects. A possible correlation between these parameters and the onset of SMI was explored, and anthropometric and metabolic parameters were also analyzed.RESULTSWaist, levels of triglycerides, proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î±), HbA(1c), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), glucose, and insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were higher in diabetic patients than in control subjects. However, no statistical differences in hs-CRP and insulin levels were detected when the data were adjusted for waist. None of these parameters varied between SMI and non-SMI patients. Mitochondrial function was impaired and leukocyte-endothelium interactions were more frequent among diabetic patients, which was evident in the lower mitochondrial O(2) consumption, membrane potential, polymorphonuclear cell rolling velocity, and GSH/GSSG ratio, and in the higher mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and rolling flux, adhesion, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin molecules observed in these subjects. Moreover, these differences correlated with SMI. Statistical differences were maintained after adjusting the data for BMI and waist, with the exception of VCAM-1 levels when adjusted for waist.CONCLUSIONSOxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and endothelium-inducing leukocyte-endothelium interactions are features of type 2 diabetes and correlate with SMI.
