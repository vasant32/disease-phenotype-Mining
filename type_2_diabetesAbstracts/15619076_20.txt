AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We examined whether plasma N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) predicts cardiovascular outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 160 microalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients (mean age 55.1 years [SD 7.2], 119 men) were enrolled in the Steno-2 Study examining the effect of multifactorial treatment, and were divided into two groups according to baseline levels of plasma NT-proBNP below or above the median for the cohort, which was followed for an average of 7.8 years. Cardiovascular outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularisation procedures in the heart or legs, and amputations. RESULTS: In the whole group, plasma NT-proBNP being above the median was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease during follow-up, with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 4.4 (95% CI 2.3-8.4; p<0.0001). A decrease in plasma NT-proBNP of 10 pg/ml during the first 2 years of intervention was associated with a 1% relative reduction in the primary endpoint (p<0.001). Despite polypharmacological treatment targeting cardiovascular disease, the mean plasma NT-proBNP level increased during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that high plasma NT-proBNP is a major risk marker for cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria.
