Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) was originally isolated as an inducer of apoptosis. Recent cross-sectional and prospective studies suggest an inverse association of serum TRAIL levels with the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and with an adverse outcome in patients with CAD or heart failure. However, it is unknown whether TRAIL can inversely reflect the progression of atherosclerosis from its early stage. We therefore examined the association between TRAIL measured by ELISA and intima-media thickness (IMT) in carotid and femoral arteries evaluated by ultrasonography as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis in 416 type 2 diabetic patients without any symptoms of CAD and heart failure. Concurrently, the existence of calcified plaque (CP) was examined. There was no significant association between TRAIL and carotid IMT (ρ=-0.096, p=0.052) or femoral IMT (ρ=-0.025, p=0.610), although TRAIL was associated with carotid IMT in a subset of patients with macrovascular diseases (ρ=-0.174, p=0.034). No difference in TRAIL levels was found between two groups with or without CP. TRAIL may not be a good candidate as a biomarker to evaluate early-stage atherosclerotic lesions.
