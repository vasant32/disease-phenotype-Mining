Hypertension is an important cardiovascular (CV) risk factor in patients with diabetes mellitus. In this setting, tight control of blood pressure (BP) significantly reduces CV morbidity and mortality. In the UK Prospective Diabetes Study, a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was superior to a 0.7% decrease in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as far as reducing morbidity and mortality was concerned. In the Hypertension Optimal Treatment study, the risk of CV events decreased by 51% among patients with type 2 diabetes randomized to the lower BP level. Based on these findings, contemporary treatment guidelines recommend a target SBP/diastolic blood pressure of <130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes.
