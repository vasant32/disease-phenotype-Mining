 OBJECTIVE: To investigate in a follow-up study whether high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) events in subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The original study population consisted of 1,059 patients with type 2 diabetes (age 45-64 years). Mean duration of diabetes was 8 years. CRP values were available from 1,045 subjects, of whom 878 were free of myocardial infarction (MI) at baseline. CHD mortality and the incidence of nonfatal MI were assessed in a 7-year follow-up. RESULTS: Altogether, 157 patients died from CHD and 254 had a nonfatal or fatal CHD event. Patients with hs-CRP >3 mg/l had a higher risk for CHD death than patients with hs-CRP < or =3 mg/l (19.8 and 12.9%, respectively, P = 0.004). In Cox regression analysis, patients with high hs-CRP had a relative risk of 1.72 for CHD death even after the adjustment for confounding factors (P = 0.002). Among subjects who were free from MI at baseline, those with a high hs-CRP level had relative risks of 1.83 (P = 0.003) and 1.84 (P = 0.004) for CHD death in univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of type 2 diabetic patients, hs-CRP was an independent risk factor for CHD deaths.
