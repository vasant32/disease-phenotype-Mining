Adipose tissue dysfunction underpins the association of obesity with type 2 diabetes. Adipogenesis is required for the maintenance of adipose tissue function. It involves the commitment and subsequent differentiation of preadipocytes and is coordinated by autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine factors. We previously reported that fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) primes primary human preadipocytes and Simpson Golabi Behmel syndrome (SGBS) preadipocytes and increases adipogenesis through a cascade involving extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Here, we aimed to use the FGF-1 system to identify novel adipogenic regulators. Expression profiling revealed bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) as a putative FGF-1 effector. BAMBI is a transmembrane protein and modulator of paracrine factors that regulate adipogenesis, including transforming growth factor (TGF) superfamily members (TGF-β and BMP) and Wnt. Functional investigations established BAMBI as a negative regulator of adipogenesis and modulator of the anti- and proadipogenic effects of Wnt3a, TGF-β1, and BMP-4. Further studies showed that BAMBI expression levels are decreased in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Collectively, these findings establish BAMBI as a novel, negative regulator of adipogenesis that can act as a nexus to integrate multiple paracrine signals to coordinate adipogenesis. Alterations in BAMBI may play a role in the (patho)physiology of obesity, and manipulation of BAMBI may present a novel therapeutic approach to improve adipose tissue function.
