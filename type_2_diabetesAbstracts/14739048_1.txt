We evaluated insulin release and insulin sensitivity in women with basal and/or postprandial hyperglycemia but normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in previous pregnancy (GHG). These women were individually matched with females without previous hyperglycemia (NGT). Both groups consisted of normal glucose-tolerant women at the time of this study. They underwent OGTT (75 g; n=32 pairs) and hyperglycemic clamp experiments (10 mmoll(-1); n=27 pairs) with plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide measurements and calculation of insulinogenic index, first- and second-phase insulin release, and insulin sensitivity index (ISI). The GHG group showed higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels (6.2+/-0.6% versus 5.8+/-0.8%; P<0.05); lower insulinogenic index at 30 min (134.03+/-62.69 pmol mmol(-1) versus 181.59+/-70.26 pmol mmoll(-1); P<0.05) and diminished C-peptide response in relation to glucose (4.05+/-0.36 nmol mmol(-1) versus 4.23+/-0.36 nmol mmol(-1); P<0.05) at OGTT. Both groups did not show difference in insulin secretion and ISI by hyperglycemic clamp technique. We concluded that in up to 12 years from index pregnancy, women with previous GHG, presenting normal glucose tolerance and well-matched with their controls, showed beta-cell dysfunction without change in ISI. As women with previous GHG are at risk of type 2 diabetes, beta-cell dysfunction may be its primary defect.
