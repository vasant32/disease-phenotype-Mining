To investigate the effects of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) exon 33 (TCC-->GCC, S1369A) polymorphism on responsiveness to gliclazide. About 115 patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with gliclazide for 8 weeks. SUR1 genotypes were tested by Taqman-PCR. After gliclazide treatment, there was association between T/G polymorphism and decrease of HbA1c. G carriers were more sensitive to gliclazide and the decrease of HbA1c was more significant than TT genotype (TT, 0.76%+/-1.70%; TG+GG, 1.60%+/-1.39%, P=0.044). The polymorphism of SUR1S1369A was associated with the therapeutic efficacy of gliclazide.
