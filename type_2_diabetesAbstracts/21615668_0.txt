We investigated the effects of exercise training on adipose tissue and skeletal muscle GLUT4 expression in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Muscle and adipose tissue samples were obtained before and after 4-weeks of exercise training in seven patients with T2D [47 ± 2 years, body mass index (BMI) 28 ± 2]. Seven control subjects (54 ± 4, BMI 30 ± 2) were recruited for baseline comparison. Adipose tissue GLUT4 protein expression was 43% lower (p < 0.05) in patients with T2D compared with control subjects and exercise training increased (p < 0.05) adipose tissue GLUT4 expression by 36%. Skeletal muscle GLUT4 protein expression was not different between control subjects and patients with T2D. Exercise training increased (p < 0.05) skeletal muscle GLUT4 protein expression by 20%. In conclusion, 4-weeks of exercise training increased GLUT4 expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of patients with T2D, although the functional benefits of this adaptation appear to be dependent on an optimal β-cell function.
