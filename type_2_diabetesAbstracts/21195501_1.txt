 AIMS: To evaluate the experience of hypoglycemia in patients treated with metformin in combination with sulphonylureas (SUs) and the impact on patients' quality of life (QoL) and worry about hypoglycemia. METHODS: This was a national, cross-sectional, multicenter study. Patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and SU dual therapy were recruited by 54 investigators between January 2009 and August 2009. The patients were asked to complete a QoL instrument, the EuroQol-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D), and the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS-II). Investigators completed a web-based case report form on laboratory values, medical history and anti-diabetic treatment. RESULTS: A total of 430 patients (60% male) were included in the study. Mean age was 69 years. Approximately one fifth of the patients experienced moderate or worse symptoms of hypoglycemia. Patients who experienced moderate or worse hypoglycemia had lower QoL as measured by the weighted EQ-5D summary score (0.81 vs. 0.88; p<0.001) than patients who experienced mild or no hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Experience of hypoglycemia was found to be associated with lower QoL in patients with type 2 diabetes on dual treatment with metformin and sulphonylurea. This should be taken into consideration when selecting treatment for these patients in clinical practice.
