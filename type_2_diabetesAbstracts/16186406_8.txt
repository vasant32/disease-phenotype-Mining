Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death among individuals with type 2 diabetes. Dyslipidemia contributes significantly to CHD in diabetic patients, in whom lipid abnormalities include hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, and increased levels of small, dense LDL particles. To identify genes for lipid-related traits, we performed genome-wide linkage analyses for levels of triglycerides and HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol in Caucasian, Hispanic, and African-American families from the Genetics of NIDDM (GENNID) study. Most lipid traits showed significant estimates of heritability (P < 0.001) with the exception of triglycerides and the triglyceride/HDL ratio in African Americans. Variance components analysis identified linkage on chromosome 3p12.1-3q13.31 for the triglyceride/HDL ratio (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 3.36) and triglyceride (LOD = 3.27) in Caucasian families. Statistically significant evidence for linkage was identified for the triglyceride/HDL ratio (LOD = 2.45) on 11p in Hispanic families in a region that showed suggestive evidence for linkage (LOD = 2.26) for triglycerides in this population. In African Americans, the strongest evidence for linkage (LOD = 2.26) was found on 19p13.2-19q13.42 for total cholesterol. Our findings provide strong support for previous reports of linkage for lipid-related traits, suggesting the presence of genes on 3p12.1-3q13.31, 11p15.4-11p11.3, and 19p13.2-19q13.42 that may influence traits underlying lipid abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes.
