Hyperinsulinemia predicts the development of type 2 diabetes, and family studies suggest that insulin levels are regulated in part by genes. We conducted a genome-wide scan to detect genes influencing variation in fasting serum insulin concentrations in 391 nondiabetic individuals from 10 large multigenerational families. Approximately 380 microsatellite markers with an average spacing of 10 cM were genotyped in all study subjects. Insulin concentrations measured by radioimmunoassay were transformed by their natural logarithms before analysis. In multipoint analysis, peak evidence for linkage occurred on chromosome 3p approximately 109 cM from pter in the region of 3p14.2-p14.1. The multipoint logarithm of odds (LOD) score was 3.07, occurring in the region flanked by markers D3S1600 and D3S1285 (P value by simulation <0.0001). In a two-point analysis, LOD scores ranged from 0.75 to 2.52 for the nine markers typed in the region spanning 88-143 cM from pter. The fasting insulin resistance index was highly correlated with fasting insulin concentrations in this sample and also provided strong evidence for linkage to this region (LOD = 2.99). There was no evidence in our genome-wide scan for linkage of insulin levels to any other chromosome. These results provide evidence that a gene-influencing variation in insulin concentrations exists on chromosome 3p. Possible candidate genes in this region include GBE1 and ACOX2, which encode enzymes involved in glycogen and fatty acid metabolism, respectively.
