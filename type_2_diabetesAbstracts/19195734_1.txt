 CONTEXT: Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) may play a role in the development of insulin resistance (IR). OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between serum RBP4 levels and IR in Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Fasting serum RBP4 levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) were measured by enzyme-linked immune assay (ELISA). Insulin sensitivity was assessed with insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), the anthropometrical parameters such as body mass index (BMI), waist hip ratio (WHR) were evaluated and fasting blood glucose (FBG), HBA1C, lipids and fasting insulin levels were also measured. RESULTS: Serum RBP4 levels were found to correlate positively with HOMA-IR (r=0.257, P=0.024) in type 2 diabetic patients. A correlation analysis showed that serum RBP4 levels also correlate with sex, BMI, WHR, TG and FINS, respectively (P<0.05). A stepwise linear multiple regression model revealed that BMI and sex were significant determinants of RBP4. CONCLUSION: There is a positive relationship between RBP4 and IR in type 2 diabetic patients. RBP4 may play a role in pathogenesis of T2DM.
