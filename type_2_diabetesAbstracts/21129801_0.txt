 AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the association between diabetic microangiopathy and subclinical atherosclerosis as a marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 142 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics who were free from CVD underwent evaluation of diabetic microangiopathy. Subclinical atherosclerosis was assessed by measuring carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and the 10-year absolute risk of CVD was estimated using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine. RESULTS: Subclinical atherosclerosis was found in 27 subjects (19.0%). The rates of hypertension and diabetic retinopathy were significantly higher among patients with subclinical atherosclerosis. The UKPDS 10-year risk for CVD was significantly increased in subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis. Old age, hypertension and the presence of diabetic retinopathy showed a significant association to subclinical atherosclerosis after further adjustments for gender, body mass index, smoking status, HbA1c, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and the presence of diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that diabetic retinopathy is an independent risk marker for subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. We suggest that a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy may warrant a more careful cardiovascular assessment even in the early stages of diabetes.
