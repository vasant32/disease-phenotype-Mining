We assessed glycaemic status in 26 overweight or obese people with type 2 diabetes suspected of having sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS). In people with SAS (n=13), nocturnal glycaemia was 38% higher, independent of body mass index (particularly during rapid eye movement sleep) compared with non-SAS subjects (p<0.008).
