A 54-year-old obese woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes was put on the maximum allowed doses of Metformin, Glimepiride and Rosiglitazone. When Exenatide was added, she lost 33 kg. She remained euglycemic for at least 7 months after the sequential discontinuation of Exenatide and the other oral agents.
