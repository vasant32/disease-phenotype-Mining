The patient was a 56-year-old man with type 2 diabetes and insulin allergy. He was administered glargine, which did not produce any allergic reactions, except for a small non-pruritic wheal. Thereafter, other insulin preparation could be administered. We consider this the first case of successful insulin desensitization by glargine administration.
