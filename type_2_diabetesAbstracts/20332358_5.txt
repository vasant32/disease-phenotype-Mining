 OBJECTIVE: Exenatide improves postprandial glycemic excursions in type 2 diabetes. Exenatide could benefit type 1 diabetes as well. We aimed to determine an effective and safe glucose-lowering adjuvant exenatide dose in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight subjects completed a three-part double-blinded randomized controlled study of premeal exenatide. Two doses of exenatide (1.25 and 2.5 microg) were compared with insulin monotherapy. Prandial insulin dose was reduced by 20%. Gastric emptying and hormones were analyzed for 300 min postmeal. RESULTS: Treatment with both doses of exenatide versus insulin monotherapy significantly reduced glucose excursions over 300 min (P < 0.0001). Exenatide administration failed to suppress glucagon but delayed gastric emptying (P < 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive exenatide therapy reduces postprandial hyperglycemia in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. This reduction in glucose excursion occurs despite reduction in insulin dose. We suggest that exenatide has therapeutic potential as adjunctive therapy in type 1 diabetes.
