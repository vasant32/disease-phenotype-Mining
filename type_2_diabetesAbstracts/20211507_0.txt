 AIMS: To examine issues of weight misperception, perceived importance of weight management, and patient reports of their HCP's weight-related recommendations among patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 575 overweight adults with type 2 diabetes completed a survey that assessed perceptions about weight management and discussions with HCP's about weight issues. RESULTS: Among patients with BMI>30, weight misperception was rare (<10%) and perceived importance of weight loss common (>85%). Among overweight patients with BMI<30, weight misperception was more common (47%) and importance of weight loss was endorsed less frequently (68%). Most patients reported that HCP's had advised weight loss (72%) and discussed weight issues at most visits (59%). However, recommendations from HCP's were rarely specific. Few were informed by HCP's that certain diabetes medications might make weight management difficult. Weight misperception was less common, importance of weight loss was more common and weight management efforts were more frequent when HCPs discussed these issues directly. CONCLUSIONS: Most overweight patients with type 2 diabetes recognize the importance of weight management. Patient reports indicate that HCP's are actively engaged in promoting weight loss and that their recommendations, when specific, are associated with patients' more frequent weight management efforts.
