 AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of a new repaglinide/metformin fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet administered either twice a day (BID) or three times a day (TID) for the management of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was a 26-week, multicentre, open-label parallel trial in which subjects poorly controlled with mono- or dual-oral antidiabetic therapy were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to instead receive repaglinide/metformin FDC either BID or TID or a rosiglitazone/metformin FDC BID. Two primary hypotheses were tested in a hierarchical manner: (i) treatment with the repaglinide/metformin FDC BID is non-inferior to that of the rosiglitazone/metformin FDC BID as measured by changes in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (results presented in companion paper) and (ii) repaglinide/metformin BID is non-inferior to repaglinide/metformin TID (as measured by changes in HbA1c). Additional efficacy and safety end-points were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 561 subjects were randomized; 383 completed the study. Repaglinide/metformin FDC BID was non-inferior to repaglinide/metformin FDC TID with respect to HbA1c. Additionally, changes in mean fasting plasma glucose values from baseline to end of study were not significantly different between the BID and the TID dose groups. There were no major hypoglycaemic episodes reported in either group during the trial, and overall adverse event profiles were similar. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of twice-daily dosing of a repaglinide/metformin FDC tablet was non-inferior to that of three-times-daily dosing.
