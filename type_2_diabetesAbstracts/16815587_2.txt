 AIM OF THIS STUDY: To describe the extent to which hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are currently detected, treated, and controlled in diabetic patients attending a network of urban community-based diabetic care clinics in Italy. METHODS: The study population included 1078 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (47% women, mean age 67.6+/-9.8 years) visited at eight diabetic care clinics between 1 and 30 of November 2004. Values of glycosilated hemoglobin, blood pressure, and cholesterol subfractions, as well as clinical and medication data, were prospectively collected in all cases in a computerized database. RESULTS: Despite a high prevalence of hypertension (66.6%), only 29.6% of patients met the treatment goal of a systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg, while a diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg was reached by 38.6% of the study cohort. Optimal LDL cholesterol values (<100mg/dl) were present in just 25.5% of cases. Values of glycosilated hemoglobin <7% were present in 57.8% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that adherence to current guidelines for cardiovascular prevention and cardiovascular risk factor control represent an exception in diabetic patients attending community-based diabetic care clinics. Major efforts are required to improve the quality of health care currently delivered to diabetic patients.
