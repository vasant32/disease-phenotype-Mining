Current treatment guidelines highlight the importance of aggressive lipid-modifying therapy in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Statins are established as the cornerstone of dyslipidaemia management in diabetic patients, based on their efficacy in lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, statins fail to address the high residual cardiovascular risk in treated patients, some of which may be attributable to low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated triglycerides and to a preponderance of small, dense LDL particles, indicating the need for further intervention. Fibrates are effective against all components of atherogenic dyslipidaemia associated with type 2 diabetes. Clinical studies, most notably the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes, indicate that fibrates, most likely in combination with a statin, have a secondary role in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly in those without prior cardiovascular disease or patients with low HDL-C. Results are awaited from the ongoing Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial to fully evaluate the outcome benefits of this combination strategy.
