 AIMS: To investigate the short-term (16 weeks) effect of lifestyle intervention on insulin sensitivity, anthropometric and metabolic variables in non-diabetic first-degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients (FDR). METHODS: Seventy-seven (49 male, 28 female) FDR were allocated to one of three groups, diet (D-group; n = 25), diet and exercise (DE-group; n = 30) or control group (C-group; n = 22). Lifestyle counselling was based on current nutrition recommendations, including increased intake of fatty fish and low glycaemic index foods. Group counselling was given on two occasions with follow-up through telephone interviews every 10 days. Assessments included insulin sensitivity index (Si), anthropometry, lipid parameters, circulating leptin and adiponectin levels. RESULTS: The D-group reduced total cholesterol (-0.31 mmol/l, P = 0.024), LDL cholesterol (-0.22 mmol/l, P = 0.021) and apolipoprotein B (-9.5 mg/dl, P = 0.009) levels, whereas the DE-group decreased body weight (-2.1%, P = 0.030) and waist circumference (-3.0 cm, P < 0.001) versus controls. A 13% reduction in fasting insulin was observed in the DE-group, but no significant improvement in Si in D-group or DE-group was observed. A subgroup, adherent to diet and who increased exercise, significantly improved Si and lipid profile. CONCLUSIONS: The improved metabolic risk profile in FDR suggests that lifestyle changes can be effective in individuals at high risk to develop type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
