 AIM: This trial evaluated the potential for improving glycaemic control by intensifying a conventional twice-daily therapy with premixed human insulin (HI) to a thrice-daily regimen using premixed formulations of biphasic insulin aspart (BIAsp) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was a multicentre, open-label, parallel group trial. After a 4-week run-in period, patients were randomized 1 : 1 to 16 weeks of treatment. A total of 748 patients were screened, 664 were exposed to trial drug and 604 completed the trial. RESULTS: Haemoglobin A(1c), the primary efficacy endpoint, was shown to be significantly lower for the BIAsp treatment group compared with the biphasic HI (BHI) 30 group [estimated mean difference: -0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-0.48; -0.16), p = 0.0001]. The average blood glucose level was significantly lower in the BIAsp group [estimated mean difference: -0.79, 95% CI (-1.17; -0.40), p = 0.0001]. There were few major hypoglycaemic episodes, 11 in the BIAsp group and 7 in the BHI 30 group. Although intensification of insulin therapy with BIAsp three times a day was associated with a higher risk of minor hypoglycaemia (relative risk = 1.58, p = 0.0038), the overall rate of minor hypoglycaemia remained low with both the BIAsp and the BHI treatments (13.1 vs. 8.3 episodes/patient year respectively). Overall safety and patient satisfaction were similar with the two insulin therapies. CONCLUSIONS: This trial confirmed that a thrice-daily BIAsp regimen can safely be used to intensify treatment for patients inadequately controlled on twice-daily BHI. A treat-to-target trial is required to explore the full potential of the BIAsp regimens and evaluate their use as a viable alternative to intensification with a basal-bolus regimen.
