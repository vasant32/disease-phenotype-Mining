AIM: To investigate the effect of glucokinase activator AZD1656 on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) as an add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (NCT01020123) was conducted over 4 months with an optional 2-month extension. Patients (n = 458) with HbA1c 7.5-10% were randomized to AZD1656 20 mg (n = 40) or 40 mg (n = 52) fixed doses or 10-140 mg (n = 91) or 20-200 mg (n = 93) titrated doses, placebo (n = 88) or glipizide 5-20 mg titrated (n = 94). Patients (n = 72) with HbA1c >10 and ≤12% received open-label AZD1656 (20-200 mg titrated). Primary outcome was placebo-corrected change in HbA1c from baseline to 4 months of treatment. RESULTS: Significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline to 4 months were observed with blinded AZD1656 10-140 and 20-200 mg versus placebo [mean (95% CI) changes: -0.80 (-1.14; -0.46) and -0.81 (-1.14; -0.47) %, respectively), with similar reductions observed with glipizide. A higher percentage of patients on AZD1656 than on placebo achieved HbA1c ≤7.0 or ≤6.5 % after 4 months. Mean (s.d.) change in HbA1c for open-label AZD1656 (20-200 mg) was -2.8 (1.19) % after 4 months. AZD1656 was well tolerated, with less hypoglycaemia than glipizide. In the extension population, HbA1c was still reduced with AZD1656 versus placebo after 6 months, but the effect of AZD1656 on glucose control was not sustained over time. CONCLUSION: Addition of AZD1656 (individually titrated) to metformin gave significant improvements in glycaemic control up to 4 months, although efficacy diminished over time.
