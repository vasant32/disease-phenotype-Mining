 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episodes occurred in diabetic adults and adolescents. METHODS: We reviewed diabetic patients of admissions with DKA in West China Hospital in Chengdu from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Clinical and laboratory data including Î²-cell function and autoantibody status were collected respectively. Patients were classified as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes or atypical diabetes based on clinical diagnosis and treatment history. And groups were compared for differences in vital statistics and biochemical profiles at presentation. RESULTS: Detailed and accurate information was obtained in relation to 263 of patients accounted for the 287 admissions admitted for DKA, of whom 41 patients had type 1 diabetes (15.59%) meanwhile 178 patients were diagnosis as T2DM (67.68%), and 37 patients could not be "typed" were classified as atypical DM (14.07%). In addition, there were two gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and five patients with other specific types. Sixty admissions (22.81%) were newly diagnosed diabetes, of which 28 admissions (46.67%) were atypical diabetes. The most common contributing factor for DKA was infection (39.16%), followed by noncompliance with anti-diabetes treatment including omission of insulin (25.5%), unknown causes (25.86%) and other medical conditions (11.73%). Of note, these middle-age obese male patients with atypical diabetes often lapse into diabetic ketoacidosis without identifiable precipitating factors. CONCLUSIONS: DKA could occur not only in T1DM but also in patients with T2DM under infection or stress condition, furthermore without any identifiable precipitant. The prevalence of DKA and its clinical heterogeneity have significant implications for diagnosing and classification of diabetes. More attention and prevention strategies are needed in ketosis-prone atypical diabetes.
