Coated-platelet levels were quantified in 58 people with Type 1 diabetes, 90 with Type 2 diabetes, and 54 non-diabetic controls. In diabetes high coated-platelet levels were related to smoking and glucose control drugs, but not to glycaemia or other drugs. Prospective studies should evaluate coated-platelets and complications and drug effects.
