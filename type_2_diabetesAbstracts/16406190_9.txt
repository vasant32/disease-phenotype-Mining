 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The data regarding comparison of efficacy of metformin with glimepiride, newest Sulfonylurea, or with the use of both drugs in combination with insulin is rare in the literature. Therefore, we assessed the daily insulin dose, hypoglycemic events and body weight on achieving desirable glycemic control after addition of insulin, to glimepiride 8 mg and/or metformin 2500 mg, in subjects with type 2 DM manifesting lapse of glycemic control. METHODS: S.C. insulin Novolog Mix [70/30], pre-supper was initiated in 12 subjects on metformin, 14 subjects on glimepiride, and 12 subjects receiving both drugs, with HbA1C > 7.5% and eight subjects receiving placebo. Insulin dose was increased by 4 U at weekly interval until fasting blood sugar [FBS] between 6.6 and 8 mM/l was attained and then further titrated by 2 U every week to attain and maintain FBS between 4.5 and 6.7 mM/l over the next 4 months. The comparisons were conducted between these groups for HbA1C, the daily insulin dose, body weight noted at the end of this study period as well as the hypoglycemic episodes per patient during the last 4 weeks of the study period. RESULTS: HbA1C levels were < 7.0% in all subjects at the end of the study. The daily insulin dose (units), total and per kg/BW was significantly lower [p < 0.001] with metformin (51 +/- 5, 0.51 +/- 0.10), glimepiride (40 +/- 4, 0.42 +/- 0.09) as well as with both drugs (23 +/- 7, 0.21 +/- 0.07) in comparison to placebo (82 +/- 10, 0.82 +/- 0.12). The insulin dose was also significantly lower [p < 0.05] in subjects on both drugs than subjects receiving them individually. Weight gain was less [p < 0.001] with metformin [2.5 +/- 0.74 kg], glimepiride [2.3 +/- 0.7 kg], and both drugs [2.2 +/- 0.61 kg] in comparison to placebo [5.2 +/- 1.4 kg] whereas the hypoglycemic episodes were lesser with metformin (3.8 +/- 1.2) and glimepiride (3.3 +/- 0.9) and least with both drugs (2.5 +/- 0.6) in comparison to placebo (5.2 +/- 1.0). CONCLUSION: Glimepiride and metformin are effective individually in achieving a glycemic goal with a less daily insulin dose, weight gain, and hypoglycemic episodes in comparison to insulin monotherapy in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus with further marked reduction in these parameters when used concurrently.
