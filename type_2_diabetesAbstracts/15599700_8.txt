AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 (PPARGC1) acts as a cofactor for several nuclear hormone receptors in many tissues and organs implicated in blood pressure regulation. Here, we assessed the association between the Gly482Ser variant of PPARGC1 and the arterial hypertension frequently found in subjects with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We studied a group of 479 men and 253 women with type 2 diabetes. Arterial hypertension was present in 70% of the men and in 73% of the women. Genotypes were examined by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the covariables associated with arterial hypertension. RESULTS: There was an association between Ser allele homozygosis and arterial hypertension in type 2 diabetic men (odds ratio of 2.52 vs Gly allele homozygosis; 95% CI: 1.32-5.00; p=0.0064), but not in women. The prevalence of arterial hypertension in type 2 diabetic men was 77% vs 73% vs 67% for Ser-Ser, Gly-Ser and Gly-Gly carriers respectively (p=0.021). Age, BMI, the use of insulin, and triglyceride and creatinine levels were also independently associated with arterial hypertension in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have observed a sex-specific association between the PPARGC-1 gene Gly482Ser polymorphism and arterial hypertension in type 2 diabetic men. Further studies are needed to investigate the genetic, biochemical and pathophysiological basis of this allelic association.
