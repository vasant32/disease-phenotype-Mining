A highly polymorphic locus flanking the human insulin gene contains two major size classes of DNA restriction fragments, which segregate in families as stable genetic elements. The L-allele, i.e. fragments with an average size of about 600 base-pairs seems to be a weak genetic marker for Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, whereas the U-allele, i.e. fragments of an average size of about 2500 base-pairs hitherto has been associated with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and diabetic hypertriglyceridaemia. The most recent reports on this subject do not confirm an association between the U-allele and Type 2 diabetes. Our own studies indicate that the U-allele is a fairly strong marker for the development of atherosclerosis (relative risk for U-carriers 3.36). The putative functions of the polymorphic region in atherogenesis and the relation of this region to other genetic markers for atherosclerosis are not known.
