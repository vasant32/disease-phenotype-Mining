 AIM: To investigate the effects of an acute exercise bout on affect and psychological well-being in individuals with type 2 diabetes. METHOD: Sixteen patients (mean BMI 28.6 kg/m(2)) took part, on separate days, in two randomly ordered conditions, in a within-subject design: a 20 min semi-self-paced brisk walk or passive control (sitting with the opportunity of reading). Ten minutes before, during (5, 10, 15, 20 min) and following (5, 10, 15, 20, 180 min) each, participants completed the Felt Arousal Scale (FAS) for affective activation and the Feeling Scale (FS) for affective pleasure/valence. The Activation Deactivation Adjective Check List (Tense Arousal and Energetic Arousal) was also completed before and after each condition. Heart rate and Ratings of Perceived Exertion (RPE) were assessed during exercise. Glucose levels were obtained from participants before and after exercise and control. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVAs revealed significant condition by time interaction effects for FS, FAS, Energetic Arousal (EA) and Tense Arousal (TA). Brisk walking increased FS (15 min after exercise p=0.020; 20 min after exercise p=0.034) and FAS (all time points after baseline). EA was significantly higher 5 min after the exercise session (p=0.029) in comparison to the control situation. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that an acute exercise bout has positive influences on affect and psychological well-being. The usefulness of exercise to elevate affective responses (activation and pleasure) should be highlighted when promoting exercise interventions in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
