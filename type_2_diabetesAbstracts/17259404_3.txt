Type 2 diabetes is a common disorder associated with obesity. Lower plasma levels of adiponectin were associated with type 2 diabetes. Candidate regions on chromosomes 1 ( approximately 70 cM) and 14 ( approximately 30 cM) were evaluated for replication of suggestive linkage results for type 2 diabetes/impaired glucose homeostasis in an independent sample of Japanese Americans. Replication of independent linkage evidence for serum levels of adiponectin on chromosome 14 was also evaluated. We investigated 529 subjects from 175 sibships who were originally part of the Honolulu Heart Program. Analyses included nonparametric linkage and association using SAGE (Statistical Analysis for Genetic Epidemiology) and FBAT (family-based test of association) programs and Monte Carlo simulation of Fisher's exact test in SAS. For type 2 diabetes/impaired glucose metabolism, nominal linkage evidence (P < 0.02) followed-up by genotypic association (P = 0.016) was found with marker D14S297 at 31.8 cM; linkage analyses using only diabetes phenotype were also nominally significant at this marker (P < 0.02). Nominal evidence for genotypic association to adiponectin serum level phenotype (P = 0.04) was found with the marker D14S1032 at 23.2 cM. The present study was limited by relatively small sample size. Nevertheless, these results corroborate earlier studies, suggesting that further research is warranted in the candidate region approximately 30 cM on chromosome 14.
