The short-chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD) protein is involved in the penultimate step of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. Previously, it has been shown that mutations in the corresponding gene (HADHSC) are associated with hyperinsulinism in infancy. The presumed function of the SCHAD enzyme in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion led us to the hypothesis that common variants in HADHSC on chromosome 4q22-26 might be associated with development of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we have performed a large-scale association study in four different cohorts from the Netherlands and Denmark (n = 7,365). Direct sequencing of HADHSC cDNA and databank analysis identified four tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including one missense variant (P86L). Neither the SNPs nor haplotypes investigated were associated with the disease, enzyme function, or any relevant quantitative measure (all P > 0.1). The present study provides no evidence that the specific HADHSC variants or haplotypes examined do influence susceptibility to develop type 2 diabetes. We conclude that it is unlikely that variation in HADHSC plays a major role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in the examined cohorts.
