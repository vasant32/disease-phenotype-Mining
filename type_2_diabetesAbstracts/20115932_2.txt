Blood glucose measurements are important components of a effective diabetes management. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) provides the possibility for collecting information on glucose levels at different timepoints and facilitates patient empowerment. However, the efficacy of SMBG in particular groups of patients is controversial. Self-monitoring is postulated to have a beneficial effect on metabolic control in type 1 diabetes as it is essential to adjust insulin doses. In type 2 diabetes the efficacy of frequent glucose measurements remains uncertain. The purpose of this paper is to overview recent data in the field of self-control to evaluate the influence of SMBG on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes. The results of studies suggest that SMBG can have an important role in improving metabolic control if it is an integral part of a wider educational strategy. SMBG can be especially recommended for type 2 diabetic patients with suboptimal metabolic control in order to promote dietary and lifestyle changes as well as treatment correction as a response to feedback provided by blood glucose results.
