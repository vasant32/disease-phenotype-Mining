Exenatide (also known as exendin-4) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 mimetic, which is indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The currently available formulation of this drug is a twice-daily exenatide (exenatide BID) injection that should be administered within 60 minutes of food. Once-weekly exenatide (exenatide QW) formulation is now being assessed in a clinical trial program. Exenatide QW has been shown to be the only noninsulin monotherapy to achieve glycosylated hemoglobin levels of <7% in >75% of treated patients. It has also demonstrated potential cardiovascular benefits by lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, triglyceride levels, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In addition, patients treated with exenatide QW achieved significant weight loss, which may also lead to significant cardiovascular risk reduction. Exenatide QW is associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects compared with exenatide BID, and no patients treated with exenatide QW monotherapy experienced a confirmed hypoglycemic event. Exenatide QW results in 24-hour coverage with exenatide concentrations that are known to improve glycemic control and remain well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review defines the state of play with exenatide QW by critically appraising its role in clinical practice.
