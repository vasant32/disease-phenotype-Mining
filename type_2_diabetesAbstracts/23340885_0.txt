OBJECTIVE To check the hypothesis that myo-inositol supplementation may reduce gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) onset in pregnant women with a family history of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A 2-year, prospective, randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled study was carried out in pregnant outpatients with a parent with type 2 diabetes who were treated from the end of the first trimester with 2 g myo-inositol plus 200 µg folic acid twice a day (n = 110) and in the placebo group (n = 110), who were only treated with 200 µg folic acid twice a day. The main outcome measure was the incidence of GDM in both groups. Secondary outcome measures were as follows: the incidence of fetal macrosomia (>4,000 g), gestational hypertension, preterm delivery, caesarean section, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and neonatal distress respiratory syndrome. GDM diagnosis was performed according to the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recommendations. RESULTS Incidence of GDM was significantly reduced in the myo-inositol group compared with the placebo group: 6 vs. 15.3%, respectively (P = 0.04). In the myo-inositol group, a reduction of GDM risk occurrence was highlighted (odds ratio 0.35). A statistically significant reduction of fetal macrosomia in the myo-inositol group was also highlighted together with a significant reduction in mean fetal weight at delivery. In the other secondary outcome measures, there were no differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS myo-Inositol supplementation in pregnant women with a family history of type 2 diabetes may reduce GDM incidence and the delivery of macrosomia fetuses.
