 OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, respectively) mediate the effects of adiponectin on glucose and lipid metabolism in vivo. We examined whether AdipoR1 and/or AdipoR2 mRNA expression in human adipose tissue is fat-depot specific. We also studied whether their expression in visceral and subcutaneous fat depots is associated with metabolic parameters and whether their expression is regulated by intensive physical exercise. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined metabolic parameters and assessed AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA expression using quantitative real-time PCR in adipose tissue in an observational study of 153 subjects and an interventional study of 60 subjects (20 each with normal glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, and type 2 diabetes) before and after intensive physical training for 4 weeks. RESULTS: AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA expression is not significantly different between omental and subcutaneous fat, but their expression is several-fold lower in adipose tissue than in muscle. AdipoR2 mRNA expression in visceral fat is highly correlated with its expression in subcutaneous fat. AdipoR2 mRNA expression in both visceral and subcutaneous fat is positively associated with circulating adiponectin and HDL levels but negatively associated with obesity as well as parameters of insulin resistance, glycemia, and other lipid levels before and after adjustment for fat mass. Physical training for 4 weeks resulted in increased AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA expression in subcutaneous fat. CONCLUSIONS: AdipoR2 mRNA expression in fat is negatively associated with insulin resistance and metabolic parameters independently of obesity and may mediate the improvement of insulin resistance in response to exercise.
