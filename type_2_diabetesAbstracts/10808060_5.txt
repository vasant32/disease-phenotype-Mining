To critically evaluate the relative importance of coagulation abnormalities over other clinical variables for micro- and macrovascular diabetic complications, prothrombin fragment (F1+2), thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), fibrin degradation product d-dimer, and alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex were determined in 101 stable, relatively well controlled patients with Type 2 diabetes (the mean HbA1c, age and duration of diabetes, 7.1%, 61 and 7.5 years, respectively). First, incidence and severity of diabetic micro- and macroangiopathies were progressively increased with the severity of coagulation abnormalities. Next, correlation of the four values with the presence of micro- and macrovascular complications, respectively, was analyzed by the multiple logistic regression analysis, with the inclusion of other variables such as age, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, blood pressure, and urinary albumin excretion. With the presence of microangiopathies, F1+2 and systolic blood pressure were significantly related, with the relationship being very strong for the former (P=0.003) and weak for the latter (P=0.035). On the other hand, with the presence of macroangiopathies, F1+2 (P=0.003), TAT (P=0.002), duration of diabetes (P=0.015), and age (P=0.013) were related. Other clinical variables were not significantly related with the presence of complications. Coagulation and fibrinolytic abnormalities are stronger determinants of the presence of diabetic vascular complications than other clinical variables including the degree of glycemia, in stable, relatively well controlled patients with Type 2 diabetes.
