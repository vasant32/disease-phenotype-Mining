Recently, an association of the G allele in UCSNP-43 of calpain 10 with type 2 diabetes and decreased glucose disposal was reported. Calpain 10 is also expressed in pancreatic islets. It is not known, however, whether and how this polymorphism contributes to the biological variation of beta-cell function. We studied 73 nondiabetic subjects from the southwest region of Germany (G/G, n = 41; G/A, n = 29; and A/A, n = 3) using a modified hyperglycemic clamp (10 mmol/l glucose, added glucagon-like peptide 1, final arginine bolus). The genotype distribution was not different between subjects with normal glucose tolerance (n = 56) and those with impaired glucose tolerance (n = 17; P = 0.74, chi2 test). First-phase insulin secretion (adjusted for sex and insulin sensitivity from hyperglycemic clamp) was greater in G/G (2,747 +/- 297 pmol/min) than in G/A + A/A (1,612 +/- 156 pmol/min, P = 0.003). Insulin secretion in response to arginine (adjusted for insulin sensitivity) was also greater in G/G (9,648 +/- 1,186 pmol/min) than in G/A + A/A (5,686 +/- 720 pmol/min, P = 0.04). The acute poststimulus proinsulin-to-insulin ratio was lower in G/G (1.6 +/- 0.4% first phase; 1.6 +/- 0.2% arginine) than in G/A + A/A (4.0 +/- 0.5% first phase, P < 0.001; 2.5 +/- 0.4% arginine, P = 0.03). In conclusion, it appears unlikely that any association of the UCSNP-43 polymorphism alone with type 2 diabetes involves impairment of insulin secretion in our population of German Caucasians. This may be entirely different with specific haplotype combinations.
