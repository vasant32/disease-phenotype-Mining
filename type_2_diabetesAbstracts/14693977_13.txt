 OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of hypertension care in patients with type 2 diabetes in general practice and identify physician, organizational, and patient factors associated with suboptimal care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 895 randomly selected diabetic patients were extracted from the electronic medical records of 95 general practitioners. Physician and organizational characteristics were collected with a questionnaire. We conducted a multilevel analysis to identify associations with blood pressure registration, hypertension treatment, and achievement of target blood pressure levels. RESULTS: For 652 patients (73%), a blood pressure measurement was recorded in the last year. Of these patients, 132 (20%) reached a target level of 135/85 mmHg. In total, 595 patients were classified as having hypertension, of whom 192 received no treatment (32%), 193 received an ACE inhibitor (32%), and 210 received other antihypertensives. Patients visiting a diabetes facility, referred to a specialist, with a female general practitioner, or with a general practitioner with </=10 years work experience had better recordings of their blood pressure. Suboptimal treatment was higher in older patients and smoking patients. Treatment was better in patients with coronary comorbidity, hyperlipidemia, or those referred to a specialist. Not achieving the blood pressure target was related to older age of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension management of type 2 diabetic patients in primary care is suboptimal. Characteristics of general practitioners as well as additional care provided by a diabetes facility or a specialist are associated with better processes of care, but blood pressure outcomes are not as clearly related to these factors.
