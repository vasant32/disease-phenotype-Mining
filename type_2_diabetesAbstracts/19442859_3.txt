 AIMS: To estimate the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and identify the potential risk factors of T2DM in Chinese adults. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 15,236 Chinese adults aged 35-74 years was selected by 4-stage random stratified sampling in 2000-2001 for present study. RESULTS: The prevalence of T2DM in Chinese adults aged 35-74 years was 5.49% (it was 2.51% in China, 1994). The odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for developing T2DM were 2.14 (1.08-4.22) for family history of diabetes, 3.90 (1.39-10.94) for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (0.83-0.91 vs. <0.83), 4.82 (1.43-16.28) for WHR (>or=0.92 vs. <0.83), and 3.14 (1.42-6.92) for triglycerides (TG) level (>or=200mg/dl vs. <150 mg/dl) among men but 2.74 (1.14-6.62) for family history of diabetes, 1.92 (1.04-3.56) for hypertension, 3.37 (1.67-6.77) for TG level (150-199 mg/dl vs. <150 mg/dl), and 3.79 (1.62-8.91) for TG level (>or=200mg/dl vs. <150mg/dl) among women. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of T2DM in Chinese adults has increased as compared with previous data for China. An effective intervention program regarding T2DM should focus on lifestyle modification and weight reduction.
