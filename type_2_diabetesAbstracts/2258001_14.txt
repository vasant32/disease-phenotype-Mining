Islet amyloid polypeptide is the major protein component of the islet amyloid of patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Since the synthesis of a structurally abnormal or mutant protein may contribute to the formation of amyloid deposits, we have examined the possibility that a mutant form of islet amyloid polypeptide or its precursor contributes to the formation of islet amyloid in Type 2 diabetic patients. We have sequenced the islet amyloid polypeptide precursor coding regions of the gene of 25 patients with Type 2 diabetes. Genomic DNA fragments corresponding to exon 2 and 3 of the islet amyloid polypeptide gene were amplified from patients' peripheral blood leucocyte DNAs using the polymerase chain reaction and specific oligonucleotide primer sets, and then directly sequenced. The nucleotide sequences of the amplified regions of both alleles of the islet amyloid polypeptide gene of these 25 patients were identical to one another and to the sequence of an islet amyloid polypeptide allele isolated from a human fetal liver genomic library. These findings suggest that a primary structural abnormality of islet amyloid polypeptide or its precursor is unlikely to play a significant role in the formation of islet amyloid in Type 2 diabetic patients.
