We evaluated the prevalence and risk factors for erectile dysfunction (ED) and interest in ED treatment among Japanese men being treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients (40-79 years; n=1118) completed the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), and questions related to interest in ED pharmacotherapy, subjective symptoms of diabetes, and general quality of life. A separate survey completed by physicians examined the relationships between age, diabetic treatments (insulin or oral), symptoms of diabetes (poor glycemic control, microangiopathy), complications of diabetes (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease), and ED. The prevalence of ED in patients with diabetes was 90%, a rate double that of non-diabetic individuals. Multivariate analyses revealed that age, insulin therapy, microangiopathy, hypertension, history of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease, leg dysesthesia, dysuria, insomnia, and anorexia all represented significant risk factors for ED. Half of all respondents were interested (29%) or would consider pharmacotherapy for ED (21%). These findings suggest that ED is a significant problem in Japanese men with diabetes, and that specific risk factors increase the prevalence of ED. Furthermore, the survey results expose national attitudes toward treatment of ED.
