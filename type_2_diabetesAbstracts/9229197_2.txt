To assess the prevalence of urinary albumin excretion abnormalities and their associations with cardiovascular disease or its classical risk factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus, 1348 clinic-proceeding patients have been studied retrospectively. The overnight urinary albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, smoking, ophthalmic and cardiovascular status, current therapies, estimates of glycemic control, plasma lipids, serum creatinine and uric acid have been ascertained. 767 (56.8%) patients were found normoalbuminuric, 461 (34.1%) microalbuminuric and 120 (8.9%) macroalbuminuric. In bivariate analyses, the urinary albumin excretion rate had statistically significant (P < 0.05) relationships with age, duration of diabetes, male sex, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic pressure, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, antihypertensive therapy, laser-treated retinopathy, kind of treatment, smoking habit, fasting glycaemia, HbA1c, creatinine, uric acid, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Borderline statistically significant (P < 0.1) relationships were found with hypolipidaemic therapy, insulin dose, non-HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1 and lipoprotein (a). In a multivariate stepwise logistic regression model, HbA1c, hypertension, male sex, age, diastolic blood pressure, coronary heart disease and body-mass index were sequentially selected as variables independently associated with microalbuminuria. Serum creatinine, HbA1c, male sex and hypertension were sequentially selected as independently associated with macroalbuminuria. Micro and macroalbuminuria are frequent abnormalities associated with poorly controlled and complicated disease, with overt cardiovascular disease and its classical risk factors as well as with the male sex.
