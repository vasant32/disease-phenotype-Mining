Podocyte structural changes have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of albuminuria in diabetes. We evaluated podocytes density, number, and structure in 67 white patients with type 2 diabetes: 21 normoalbuminuric (NA), 23 microalbuminuric (MA), and 23 proteinuric (P). Kidney function and biopsy studies were performed; 20 kidney donors served as control subjects. Electron microscopic morphometric analysis was used to estimate numerical density of podocytes per glomerulus [Nv(epi/glom)], filtration slit length density per glomerulus (FSLv/glom), and foot process width (FPW). The number of podocytes per glomerulus (Epi N/glom) was obtained by multiplying Nv(epi/glom) by mean glomerular volume. Nv(epi/glom) was significantly decreased in all type 2 diabetic groups compared with control subjects and was lower in MA and P than in NA (P < 0.0001, ANOVA). Epi N/glom was lower in MA and P patients compared with control subjects (P < 0.002, ANOVA); however, there were no significant differences among the type 2 diabetic groups. In addition, MA and P had decreased FSLv/glom and increased FPW compared with NA (P < 0.005 for both, ANOVA). The albumin excretion rate was inversely related to Nv(epi/glom) and FSLv/glom and directly to FPW (P < 0.0005 for all), whereas there was no correlation with Epi N/glom. In conclusion, changes in podocyte structure and density occur since the early stages of diabetic nephropathy and might contribute to increasing albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. These findings also suggest that in white type 2 diabetic patients, the density of podocytes may be functionally more relevant than the absolute number.
