To investigate the possible relevance of free radicals and prostanoids to the mode of initiation and/or evolution of microangiopathy in diabetes mellitus, we measured serum lipid peroxides (LPO), an accepted index of intravascular free radicals, and plasma 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (11-dehydro-TXB2), a stable metabolite of vasoactive thromboxane A2 released from platelets, in 95 patients with normolipidemic type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus at different stages of the disease. In general, either LPO or 11-dehydro-TXB2 was significantly greater in the patients, as a group, than in the matched controls (3.82 vs. 2.65 nmol/ml, P < 0.01 for LPO; and 17.3 vs. 5.8 pg/ml, P < 0.01 for 11-dehydro-TXB2). In patients, both LPO and 11-dehydro-TXB2 increased according to the severity of their diabetic retinopathy. A highly significant positive correlation existed between the LPO values and 11-dehydro-TXB2 in the patients (r = 0.64, P < 0.0001), while there was no such relationship in the controls (r = 0.18, P = NS). No difference in serum levels of apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, B, C-II, C-III, or E was observed between the patients and controls. Short-term glycemic control (25 cal/kg of standardized body weight/day, for 8 weeks) resulted in a small but significant reduction in LPO (4.2 vs. 4.6 nmol/ml, control; P < 0.05) without alteration in 11-dehydro-TXB2. There was a tendency towards deterioration in LPO according to the improvement in glycemic control. These results appear consistent with the view that, in addition to LPO, the release of TXA2 from activated platelet in the human circulation could be an important factor for the initiation and/or evolution of microangiopathy in diabetic patients even when they are not apparently hyperlipidemic. Further, the results of the present study emphasize the notion that more tight control of serum lipids is worthy of serious consideration in preventing the advance of diabetic microangiopathy.
