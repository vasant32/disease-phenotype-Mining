We screened for mutations in the gene of insulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase 3B (PDE3B), which regulates antilipolytic actions of insulin via reduction of intracellular cyclic AMP levels, in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus using single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis and Southern analysis and investigated frequencies of variable number of tandem repeats. A silent polymorphism at the Arg463 codon (AGG-->AGA) in exon 4 was identified after examining all 16 exons and exon-intron splicing junctions of the gene. This polymorphism was found in 53 of 100 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 2 of 5 lipoatrophic diabetic patients and 24 of 50 control subjects, without any significant difference in allele frequency between groups. An EcoRI restriction fragment length polymorphism was identified in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and control subjects, again with no differences in occurrence. The allelic distribution of two polymorphic tandem repeats sequences in introns 5 and 12 of the gene did not differ significantly between patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and control subjects. In conclusion, alterations in the PDE3B gene are unlikely to contribute importantly to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus or lipoatrophic diabetes mellitus in Japan.
