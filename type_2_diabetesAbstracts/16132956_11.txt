AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha has been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and variation in the gene encoding TNF-alpha (TNF) has shown inconsistent associations with susceptibility to both conditions. Additionally, the coding non-synonymous variant T60N in the neighbouring LTA gene has been reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes. The present study aimed to obtain a robust assessment of the role of variation in the tightly linked TNF/LTA region in diabetes susceptibility by genotyping TNF and LTA variants in large case-control resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The G-308A and G-238A TNF promoter variants and the LTA T60N polymorphism were genotyped in two UK case samples that were ascertained for positive family history and/or early onset of type 2 diabetes (combined n=858) and in 1,257 ethnically matched controls. RESULTS: There were no significant associations between the T60N, G-308A or G-238A genotype and type 2 diabetes in the combined analysis (exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic for ordered genotypes for T60N, p=0.69; for G-308A, p=0.51; for G-238A, p=0.16). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The present study, one of the largest association analyses yet reported at this locus, provides no evidence that the specific TNF or LTA variants examined influence susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. More comprehensive studies of the TNF/LTA locus in substantially larger sample sets are required to establish whether genome sequence variation at this locus truly influences susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.
