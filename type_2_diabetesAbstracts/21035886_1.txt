Long-term fasting plasma glucose (FPG) variability was a risk factor for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) independent of the mean FPG or HbA1c in people with type 2 diabetes. PDR development was also significantly associated with mean HbA1c more than 5 years earlier and with mean FPG more than 10 years earlier.
