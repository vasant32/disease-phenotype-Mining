 AIMS: Several studies have demonstrated worse perception of quality of life (QoL) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of our study was to assess QoL in a clinical sample of patients with T2DM and its association with depressive symptoms and glycemic control. METHODS: One hundred outpatients from a sequential sample underwent clinical and psychiatric evaluation. The Problem Areas of Diabetes scale (PAID) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to assess, respectively, QoL and the presence of overall psychopathology. The levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were used as the main parameter of glycemic control. RESULTS: The perception degree of the QoL related with diabetes was associated with the severity of depressive symptoms (r=0.503; p<0.001), but not with HbA1c levels (p=0.117). However, the severity of general psychopathology, evaluated through the BDI scores, predicted the metabolic control, measured by HbA1c levels, among the patients in our sample (r=0.233; p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, PAID was a valuable tool for the evaluation of QoL in T2DM and the screening of depressive symptoms. However, no correlation observed between PAID scores and HbA1c levels. Self-perception evaluation of T2DM patient can help to identify susceptible subjects to current depression.
