 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is more common in patients with diabetes than among control subjects. In addition, we wanted to clarify the clinical significance of ASB in patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data since 1966. Twenty-two studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the meta-analysis. RESULTS: ASB was present in 439 of 3,579 (12.2%) patients with diabetes and in 121 of 2,702 (4.5%) healthy control subjects. ASB was more common both in patients with type 1 diabetes (odds ratio 3.0 [95% CI 1.1-8.0]) and type 2 diabetes (3.2 [2.0-5.2]) than in control subjects. The point prevalence of ASB was higher in both women (14.2 vs. 5.1%; 2.6 [1.6-4.1]) and men (2.3 vs. 0.8%; 3.7 [1.3-10.2]) as well as in children and adolescents (12.9 vs. 2.7%; 5.4 [2.7-11.0]) with diabetes than in healthy control subjects. Albuminuria was more common in patients with diabetes and ASB than those without ASB (2.9 [1.7-4.8]). History of urinary tract infections was associated with ASB (1.6 [1.1-2.3]). CONCLUSIONS: We were able to show that the prevalence of ASB is higher in all patients with diabetes compared with control subjects. We also found that diabetic subjects with ASB more often had albuminuria and symptomatic urinary tract infections.
