 OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics of the diabetic population that formed part of a population-based survey conducted in MÃ©xico. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 2000, information was obtained from 42,886 subjects aged > or =20 years using a multistage sampling procedure. Standardized questionnaires were used. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, and capillary glucose concentrations were taken. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes was found in 3,597 subjects (age-adjusted prevalence 8.18%), of which 2,878 (80%) had previously been diagnosed. The average age of the diabetic participants was 55.2 +/- 13.5 years; 13% were <40 years of age. Nine percent had been diagnosed for >10 years. The average BMI was 29.2 +/- 5.7 kg/m(2); three-quarters of the cases had BMI >25 kg/m(2). The average waist circumference was 102 +/- 13.4 cm, and increased waist circumference was more common among women. Arterial hypertension was found in half of the cases and, of those on treatment, only one-third had a blood pressure <140/90 mmHg. Smoking was reported in 34% of the diabetic group, a higher rate than in the nondiabetic subjects. There was at least one modifiable coronary risk factor in 67.6% of the cases. Very few followed an exercise or dietary regimen and a small percentage used insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes affects a large proportion of Mexican adults (8.18%). This figure may be underestimated. The majority of the subjects had modifiable risk factors for the chronic complications of diabetes. Only a few achieved adequate blood pressure control and other treatment goals.
