 OBJECTIVE: To investigate urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and its relation with C-reactive protein (CRP) and the metabolic syndrome in the prediction of the development of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used data from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End Stage Disease (PREVEND) study, an ongoing, community-based, prospective cohort study initiated in 1997 in the Netherlands. The initial cohort consisted of 8,592 subjects. After 4 years, 6,894 subjects participated in a follow-up survey. Subjects with diabetes at baseline or missing data on fasting glucose were excluded, leaving 5,654 subjects for analysis. The development of type 2 diabetes, defined as a fasting glucose > or = 7.0 mmol/l and/or the use of antidiabetic medication, was used as the outcome measure. UAE was calculated as the mean UAE from two consecutive 24-h urine collections. Logistic regression models were used, with the development of type 2 diabetes as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Of the 5,654 subjects for whom data were analyzed, 185 (3.3%) developed type 2 diabetes during a mean follow-up period of 4.2 years. UAE, CRP, and the presence of the metabolic syndrome at baseline were significantly associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes (P < 0.001 for all variables). In a univariate model, the odds ratio (OR) for UAE was 1.59 (95% CI 1.42-1.79). In our full model, adjusted for age, sex, number of criteria of metabolic syndrome, and other known risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (including fasting insulin), the association between UAE and type 2 diabetes remained significant (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.25-1.88, P < 0.001). There was a significant interaction between UAE and CRP (P = 0.002). After CRP was stratified into tertiles, the ORs for the association between baseline UAE and the development of type 2 diabetes were 2.2 (1.47-3.3), 1.33 (0.96-1.84), and 1.04 (0.83-1.31) for the lowest to highest tertiles, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: UAE predicts type 2 diabetes independent of the metabolic syndrome and other known risk markers of development of type 2 diabetes. The predictive value of UAE was modified by the level of CRP.
