 AIMS: Basal insulin treatment is frequently used in type 2 diabetes, but the successful control of postprandial glucose is challenging. We compared the effect of preferential postprandial glucose targeting drugs for postprandial glucose control after optimizing fasting glucose with basal insulin. METHODS: This study was performed in 58, insulin naïve type 2 diabetes. After fasting glucose was optimized by insulin glargine, nateglinide or acarbose was initiated and then crossed over after second wash out period. 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and 7 point self monitoring blood glucose for 3 days at the end of each period was performed. RESULTS: Both drugs effectively reduced postprandial glucose levels compared with the insulin glargine monotherapy. No significant differences were found between nateglinide and acarbose in terms of mean glucose level, standard deviation of glucose levels, mean average glucose excursion and average daily risk range. Homeostasis model analysis (HOMA)% β, corrected insulin response and insulin-to-glucose ratio were significantly higher in the responder group compared with the non-responder. There was no episode of severe hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Nateglinide and acarbose are equally effective in type 2 diabetes for postprandial glucose excursions during basal insulin treatment. The markers of beta cell function might be used for predicting response. (Clinical trial reg. no. NCT 00437918, clinicaltrail.gov.).
