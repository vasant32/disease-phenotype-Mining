BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes who are failing on oral agents will generally gain a large amount of body fat when switched to insulin treatment. This adverse effect may be related to chronic hyperinsulinism induced by long-acting insulin compounds. AIM: To test the concept that regain of glycaemic control can be achieved without causing weight gain, using a regimen free of long-acting insulin. METHODS: In a 3-month open-label pilot study including 25 patients with moderate overweight and secondary failure, we investigated whether nocturnal glycaemic control could be achieved with glimepiride administered at 20:00 hours. The starting dose was 1-2 mg, with subsequent titration up to a maximum of 6 mg. Rapid-acting insulin analogues were used three times daily to regain postprandial glucose control. RESULTS: Glycaemic control at 3 months was established with glimepiride in a dose of 4.4 +/- 0.3 mg/day (mean +/- standard error of the mean), and a total daily insulin dose of 24.1 +/- 2.6 IU. Fasting glucose levels decreased from 12.7 +/- 0.6 mmol/l to 8.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (p < 0.001), and target levels were reached in 14 of 25 patients (56%). Mean HbA1c decreased from 10.5 +/- 0.4 to 7.7 +/- 0.2% (p < 0.001). Symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia was not reported. Body weight did not change (85.7 +/- 3.6 kg vs. 85.7 +/- 3.3 kg, p = 0.99). CONCLUSION: The data suggest that this new approach may be useful in about 50% of type 2 diabetes patients presenting with failure on maximal oral treatment.
