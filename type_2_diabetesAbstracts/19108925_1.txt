Effects of glucomannan as a supplementary treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus were investigated by measuring ghrelin, leptin and insulin responses to OGTT. Glucomannan enhanced prandial ghrelin reduction when given before glucose load and impeded the rise of fasting ghrelin after 4-week supplement. Ghrelin-induced feeding may be attenuated by glucomannan.
