 OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of pramlintide in patients with type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled with basal insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 212 patients using insulin glargine with or without oral antidiabetes agents (OAs) were randomized to addition of pramlintide (60 or 120 microg b.i.d./t.i.d.) or placebo. Insulin glargine was adjusted to target a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 70-100 mg/dl. One coprimary end point was the change in A1C at week 16. The other coprimary end point was a composite measure of overall diabetes control comprising A1C < or = 7.0% or reduction > or = 0.5%, mean daily postprandial glucose (PPG) increments < or = 40 mg/dl, no increase in body weight, and no severe hypoglycemia. Patients meeting all four conditions at week 16 achieved this end point. RESULTS: More pramlintide- than placebo-treated patients achieved the composite end point (25 vs. 7%; P < 0.001). Reductions (means +/- SE) in A1C (-0.70 +/- 0.11% vs. -0.36 +/- 0.08%; P < 0.05) and PPG increments (-24.4 +/- 3.6 mg/dl vs. -0.4 +/- 3.0 mg/dl; P < 0.0001) were greater in pramlintide- versus placebo-treated patients, respectively. Glycemic improvements were accompanied by progressive weight loss with pramlintide and weight gain with placebo (-1.6 +/- 0.3 kg vs. +0.7 +/- 0.3 kg; P < 0.0001). No treatment-related severe hypoglycemia occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Pramlintide improved multiple glycemic parameters and reduced weight with no increase in hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes who were not achieving glycemic targets with basal insulin with or without OAs.
