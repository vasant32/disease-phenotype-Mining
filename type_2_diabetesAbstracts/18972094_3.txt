 AIMS/HYPOTHESES: Insulin-stimulated glucose transport in muscle is impaired in type 2 diabetes, presumably reflecting reduced activation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). As previously shown, reductions in aPKC activation are seen at sub-maximal and maximal insulin stimulation, reductions in PKB activation are best seen at sub-maximal insulin stimulation and aPKC reductions at maximal insulin are partly improved by thiazolidinedione or metformin treatment. However, effects of combined thiazolidinedione-metformin treatment on aPKC or PKB activation by sub-maximal and maximal insulin are unknown. METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients were examined before and 5 to 6 weeks after combined thiazolidinedione-metformin therapy for activation of muscle aPKC and PKBbeta and their upstream activators, the insulin receptor (IR) and IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), during euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp studies conducted with sub-maximal (400-500 pmol/l) and maximal (1400 pmol/l) insulin concentrations. RESULTS: Following combined thiazolidinedione-metformin therapy, increases in glucose disposal and increases in sub-maximal and maximal insulin-induced activities of all four muscle signalling factors, IR, IRS-1-dependent PI3K (IRS-1/PI3K), aPKC and PKBbeta, were observed. Increases in PKBbeta enzyme activity were accompanied by increases in phosphorylation of PKB and its substrate, AS160, which is needed for glucose transport. Despite improved aPKC activity, muscle aPKC levels, which are diminished in type 2 diabetes, were not altered. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Combined thiazolidinedione-metformin treatment markedly improves sub-maximal and maximal insulin signalling to IR, IRS-1/PI3K, aPKC and PKBbeta in type 2 diabetic muscle. These improvements exceed those previously reported after treatment with either agent alone.
