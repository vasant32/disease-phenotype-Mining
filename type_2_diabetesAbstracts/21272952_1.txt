Renal dysfunction can be evaluated by increased intra-renal arterial resistance index (RI). We evaluated 113 Chinese men with type 2 diabetes on their RI. Results suggest that RI is associated with chronic kidney disease and subclinical arteriosclerosis. RI may help monitoring the deterioration of intra-renal hemodynamics.
