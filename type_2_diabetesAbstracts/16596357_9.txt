AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In healthy normolipidaemic and normoglycaemic control subjects, HDL are able to reverse the inhibition of vasodilation that is induced by oxidised LDL. In type 2 diabetic patients, HDL are glycated and more triglyceride-rich than in control subjects. These alterations are likely to modify the capacity of HDL to reverse the inhibition of vasodilation induced by oxidised LDL. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using rabbit aorta rings, we compared the ability of HDL from 16 type 2 diabetic patients and 13 control subjects to suppress the inhibition of vasodilation that is induced by oxidised LDL. RESULTS: Oxidised LDL inhibited endothelium-dependent vasodilation (maximal relaxation [Emax] = 58.2+/-14.6 vs 99.3+/-5.2% for incubation without any lipoprotein, p < 0.0001). HDL from control subjects significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of oxidised LDL on vasodilatation (Emax = 77.6+/-12.9 vs 59.5+/-7.7%, p < 0.001), whereas HDL from type 2 diabetic patients had no effect (Emax = 52.4+/-20.4 vs 57.2+/-18.7%, NS). HDL triglyceride content was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients than in control subjects (5.3+/-2.2 vs 3.1+/-1.4%, p < 0.01) and was highly inversely correlated to Emax for oxidised LDL+HDL in type 2 diabetic patients (r = -0.71, p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the ability of HDL to counteract the inhibition of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation induced by oxidised LDL is impaired and is inversely correlated with HDL triglyceride content. These findings suggest that HDL are less atheroprotective in type 2 diabetic patients than in control subjects.
