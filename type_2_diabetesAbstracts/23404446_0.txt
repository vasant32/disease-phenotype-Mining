AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The increased all-cause mortality in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers cannot fully be explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The significance of heart-rate-corrected QT (QTc) prolongation, a finding often seen in these patients, is unknown. Recently, the importance of metabolic control and hypoglycaemia has been discussed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different HbA(1c) levels and QTc prolongation on all-cause mortality in the high-risk population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and foot ulcers. METHODS: All patients with type 2 diabetes, younger than 80 years, visiting our diabetes foot unit, with a foot ulcer duration >4 weeks, were screened for participation. Patients on dialysis were excluded. Patients were grouped according to HbA(1c) level and QTc time ≤ or > 440 ms. RESULTS: Patients (n = 214, median age 69.1 years) were grouped according to HbA(1c) level (HbA(1c) < 7.5% [<58 mmol/mol] n = 81, 7.5-8.9% [58-74 mmol/mol] n = 70, >8.9% [>74 mmol/mol] n = 63). Baseline characteristics, including use of potential hypoglycaemic drugs, were similar between groups. During the 8 years of follow-up 151 patients died (70.6%) and HbA(1c) < 7.5% (<58 mmol/mol) was strongly associated with increased mortality. The highest mortality was seen in patients with a combination of HbA(1c) < 7.5% (<58 mmol/mol) and QTc prolongation, with an 8 year mortality of 92.1% as compared with 48.8% in those with HbA(1c) < 7.5% (<58 mmol/mol) but without QTc prolongation. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATIONS: HbA(1c) < 7.5% (<58 mmol/mol) in a high-risk population of patients with type 2 diabetes and foot ulcers is associated with a significantly higher mortality, particularly in patients with QTc prolongation.
