 BACKGROUND: Oolong tea has been studied for its effect on cardiovascular disease and obesity. Plasma adiponectin levels are reduced in obesity, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in coronary artery disease (CAD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate prospectively, whether intake of Oolong tea influences plasma adiponectin levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, serum triglyceride and plasma glucose levels in patients with CAD. METHODS: Twenty two patients in our study consumed Oolong tea (1000 ml) or water for 1 month in our randomized cross-over study design. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in plasma adiponectin levels before and after 1 month intake of Oolong tea (6.26 +/- 3.26 microg/ml versus 6.88 +/- 3.28 microg/ml, P < 0.05), and in plasma level LDL particle size (25.02+/-0.67 nm versus 25.31+/-0.60 nm, P < 0.01). The water-consuming control group showed no changes (6.28+/-3.28 microg/ml versus 6.23+/-3.21 microg/ml) in adiponectin levels or LDL particle sizes (25.03+/-0.70 nm versus 25.02+/-0.72 nm). We also observed a significant difference in hemoglobin A1c levels (7.23 +/- 4.45% versus 6.99 +/- 4.30%, P < 0.05) before and after intake of Oolong tea. CONCLUSION: Oolong tea may have beneficial effects on the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with CAD.
