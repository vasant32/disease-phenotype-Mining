OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease in which both beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance are pathogenetic factors. Disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia (elevated proinsulin/insulin) is another abnormality in type 2 diabetes whose mechanism is unknown. Increased demand due to obesity and/or insulin resistance may result in secretion of immature beta-cell granules with a higher content of intact proinsulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the impact of obesity on beta-cell secretion in normal subjects and in type 2 diabetic patients by measuring intact proinsulin, total proinsulin immunoreactivity (PIM), intact insulin, and C-peptide (by radioimmunoassay) by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in the fasting state and during a 120-min glucagon (1 mg i.v.) stimulation test. Lean (BMI 23.5 +/- 0.3 kg/m2) (LD) and obese (30.1 +/- 0.4 kg/m2) (OD) type 2 diabetic patients matched for fasting glucose (10.2 +/- 0.6 vs. 10.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l) were compared with age- and BMI-matched lean (22.4 +/- 0.6 kg/m2) (LC) and obese (30.8 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) (OC) normal control subjects. RESULTS: Diabetic patients (LD vs. LC and OD vs. OC) had elevated fasting levels of intact proinsulin 6.6 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3 pmol/l and 7.7 +/- 2.0 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.2 pmol/l; PIM: 19.9 +/- 2.5 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.0 pmol/l and 29.6 +/- 6.1 vs. 6.1 +/- 0.9 pmol/l; and total PIM/intact insulin: 39 +/- 4 vs. 15 +/- 2% and 35 +/- 5 vs. 13 +/- 2%, all P < 0.01. After glucagon stimulation, PIM levels were disproportionately elevated (PIM/intact insulin based on area under the curve analysis) in diabetic patients (LD vs. LC and OD vs. OC): 32.6 +/- 6.7 vs. 9.2 +/- 1.1% and 22.7 +/- 5.2 vs. 9.1 +/- 1.1%, both P < 0.05. Intact insulin and C-peptide net responses were significantly reduced in type 2 diabetic patients, most pronounced in the lean group. The ratio of intact proinsulin to PIM was higher in diabetic patients after stimulation in both LD versus LC: 32 +/- 3 vs. 23 +/- 2%, and OD versus OC: 28 +/- 4 vs. 16 +/- 2%, both P < 0.01. In obese normal subjects, intact proinsulin/PIM was lower both in the fasting state and after glucagon stimulation: OC versus LC: 22 +/- 3 vs. 33 +/- 3% (fasting) and 16 +/- 2 vs. 23 +/- 2% (stimulated), both P < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Increased secretory demand from obesity-associated insulin resistance cannot explain elevated intact proinsulin and disproportionate hyperproinsulinemia in type 2 diabetes. This abnormality may be an integrated part of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in this disease.
