 OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of a 12-month pharmaceutical care (PC) program on vascular risk in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 198 community-based patients randomized to PC or usual care. PC patients had face-to-face goal-directed medication and lifestyle counseling at baseline and at 6 and 12 months plus 6-weekly telephone assessments and provision of other educational material. Clinical, biochemical, and medication-related data were sent regularly to each patient's physician(s). The main outcome measure was change in HbA(1c). A diabetes-specific risk engine was used to estimate changes in 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke risk in patients without a history of cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: At total of 180 patients (91%) completed the study. Mean (95% CI) reductions were greater in PC case subjects (n = 92) than control subjects (n = 88) for HbA(1c) (-0.5% [95% CI -0.7 to -0.3] vs. 0 [-0.2 to 0.2]) and systolic (-14 mmHg [-19 to -9] vs. -7 [-11 to -2]) and diastolic (-5 mmHg [-8 to -3] vs. -2 [-4 to 1]) blood pressure (P < or = 0.043). The improvement in HbA(1c) persisted after adjustment for baseline value and demographic and treatment-specific variables. The median (interquartile range) 10-year estimated risk of a first CHD event decreased in the PC case subjects (25.1% [15.6-36.2] to 20.3 [14.6-30.2]; n = 42, P = 0.002) but not in the control subjects (26.1% [17.2-39.4] vs. 26.4 [16.7-38.0]; n = 52, P = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: A 12-month PC program in type 2 diabetes reduced glycemia and blood pressure. Pharmacist involvement contributed to improvement in HbA(1c) independently of pharmacotherapeutic changes. PC could prove a valuable component of community-based multidisciplinary diabetes care.
