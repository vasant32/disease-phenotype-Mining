This study was carried out to determine the effect of sex and oral administration of oleoyl-oestrone on body weight of 12-week-old female and male Zucker obese (fa/fa) rats initially weighing 350-380 g and 405-420 g, respectively. The rats were maintained in standard conditions and given a daily oral gavage of 0.2 ml oleoyl-oestrone dissolved in sunflower oil at a dose of 10 micromol/kg/day for 10 days, and their body weight and food intake was monitored. They were then killed, and their carcass composition (water, lipid, protein and total energy), liver lipids and glycogen and plasma chemistry, insulin, free and total oestrone were measured. Oral administration of oleoyl-oestrone via gavage resulted in significant losses of fat, energy and-ultimately-weight. Treatment with oleoyl-oestrone decreased food intake; the energy expenditure was kept close to that of controls at the expense of internal fat stores. Nevertheless, body protein and plasma metabolite homeostasis were preserved. The slimming effects were more marked in males than in females. Treatment increased circulating acyl-oestrone and reduced to normal levels the high insulin observed in controls. Treatment of genetically obese rats with a daily oral gavage of oleoyl-oestrone resulted in the loss of fat reserves with little modification of other metabolic parameters, except for lower plasma glucose and insulin levels. The results suggest that oleoyl-oestrone, in addition to its slimming effects may be effective as an antidiabetic agent in type 2 diabetes.
