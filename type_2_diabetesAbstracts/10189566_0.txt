Before any treatment of type 2 diabetes in accordance with the principles of evidence-based medicine can be generally recommended, the considerable disease heterogeneity must be taken into account, and randomized controlled intervention trials directed to cardiovascular and microangiopathic organ damage end points must be performed for the various subgroups of patients. Until then, it appears prudent to treat the typical Caucasian type 2 diabetic patient primarily by nondrug therapies, and if they fail to achieve the patient's individual treatment goals, then insulin treatment should be initiated. Treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with insulin alone, aimed at the patient's individual therapeutic goals, is effective and safe when conducted as an integral part of specific and structured treatment and teaching programs. Insulin treatment can be safely used to achieve near-normal HbA1c levels (< 7.0-7.5%) if prevention of diabetic microangiopathy is indicated, or to maintain HbA1c levels < 8.5-9.0% if catabolic symptoms due to insulin deficiency are to be prevented.
