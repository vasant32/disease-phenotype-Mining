Diabetes is a complex disease that affects many organs directly or indirectly. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance with a relative deficiency in insulin secretion. It has become apparent that inter-organ communication is of great importance in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Far from being an inert tissue in terms of inter-organ communication, it is now recognized that skeletal muscle can secrete so-called myokines that can impact on the function of distant organs/tissues both favourably and unfavourably. We have proposed that communication between insulin-resistant skeletal muscle and β-cells occurs in diabetes. This is a novel route of communication that we further suggest is modified by the prevailing degree of insulin resistance of skeletal muscle. This review focuses on the various myokines [interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α, CXCL10, follistatin and IL-8] which have been identified either after different types of exercise or in the secretome from control and insulin-resistant human skeletal myotubes. We will also summarize studies on the impact of several myokines on pancreatic β-cell proliferation, survival and function.
