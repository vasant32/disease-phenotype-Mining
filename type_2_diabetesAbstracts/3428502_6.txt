We measured serum lipids, lipoproteins and post-heparin plasma lipases, lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase, in 12 female patients with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes (postglucagon C-peptide undetectable), in 11 female insulin-treated patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes (postglucagon C-peptide greater than 0.60 nmol/l) and in 16 non-diabetic female control subjects. These three groups of subjects were similar with respect to age and obesity. Insulin dose was similar in patients with Type 1 and with Type 2 diabetes. HDL and HDL2 cholesterol were lower in patients with Type 2 diabetes than in non-diabetic control subjects (p less than 0.05) but did not differ between patients with Type 1 diabetes and non-diabetic control subjects. No difference in lipoprotein lipase activity was seen between the groups. The highest levels of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities were observed in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Lipoprotein lipase activity correlated significantly with HDL cholesterol in patients with Type 1 diabetes (p less than 0.01) and in patients with Type 2 diabetes (p less than 0.001) but not in control subjects. Hepatic lipase activity did not correlate significantly with HDL cholesterol in any of the groups. In conclusion, postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities do not seem to explain the difference in HDL cholesterol concentration between patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
