We report the results of cross-sectional, prospective, and longitudinal studies identifying etiologic metabolic factors in the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus of the Pima Indians of Arizona, whose prevalence and incidence rates of the disease are the highest in the world. Diabetic Pima Indians are metabolically prototypic, with obesity, insulin resistance, a reduced acute insulin response to glucose, and increased endogenous glucose production. Cross-sectional studies show that the acute insulin response is absent in diabetic subjects and lower in impaired than in normal glucose-tolerant subjects. Prospective studies using proportional hazards analyses indicate that insulin resistance and a relatively low acute insulin response predict diabetes independently of age, gender, and each other, with obesity increasing susceptibility by worsening one or both predictors. Longitudinal studies show that glucose tolerance deteriorates as the degree of obesity increases due to worsening insulin resistance and decreases in early insulin secretion. Furthermore, since the children of diabetic pregnancies are at much greater risk of developing diabetes at a young age than those of nondiabetic pregnancies, the diabetic uterine environment may induce insulin resistance and/or reduced insulin secretion: early evidence confirms that adult normal glucose-tolerant offspring show a substantially decreased acute insulin response--the clearest demonstration yet of an environmental condition increasing susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the genetic determinants require elucidation: correlation of the acute insulin response with the age of parental diabetes onset in fathers as well as mothers indicates a mechanism independent of the diabetic uterine environment.
