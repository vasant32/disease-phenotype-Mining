In an attempt to examine the role of an ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in type 2 diabetes, we conducted a case-control association study among 132 couple-pairs from northern China. The genotype frequencies for II, ID, and DD were 39.8, 39.8, and 20.3%, respectively, in the case group and 44.8, 44.8, and 10.4% in the control group. The DD frequency was significantly higher in the case group than in the control group (chi(2)(1) = 4.77, P = 0.03), suggesting that the DD genotype is associated with an increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in our study population.
