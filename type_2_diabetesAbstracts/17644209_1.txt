Chronic hyperinsulinemia is both a marker and a cause for insulin resistance. This study analyzes the effect of long-term exposure to high insulin levels on insulin-insulin receptor metabolism in human myoblasts. Cells were grown in the presence of low (107 pM, SkMC-L) or high (1430 pM, SkMC-H) insulin concentrations. Insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylation, IR internalization, dissociation and recycling, as well as insulin degradation have been investigated. Basal IR phosphorylation was higher in SkMC-H than in SkMC-L (P<0.01) but after acute insulin stimulation (10nM insulin for 10 min), IR phosphorylation increased (P<0.01) in SkMC-L, but not in SkMC-H. Chronic hyperinsulinism significantly decreased insulin-IR complex internalization (P<0.01). Nevertheless the t(1/2) value of receptor internalization was similar in both cells. Intracellular dissociation of insulin-IR complex was slightly but significantly lower in SkMC-H than in SkMC-L. Finally, SkMC-H showed a complete, but significantly delayed recycling of IR to plasma membrane (t(1/2)=20 min versus SkMC-L t(1/2)=7 min). The time course of intracellular degradation measured by HPLC, showed whenever studied, significantly (P<0.01) higher levels of intracellular intact insulin in cells exposed to high insulin concentrations. Nevertheless, the patterns of insulin degradation were over-imposable between SkMC-H and SkMC-L. In summary, continuous exposure of cultured myoblasts to high insulin levels induces subtle derangements of intracellular receptor trafficking and insulin degradation. These alterations may contribute to the insulin resistance of hyperinsulinemic states such as obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.
