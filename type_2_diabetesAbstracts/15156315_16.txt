AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) modulates tissue-specific glucocorticoid concentrations by generating active cortisol. We have shown that adipose tissue 11beta-HSD1 mRNA levels were associated with adiposity and insulinaemia. Here we conducted further expression and genetic association studies in Pima Indians. METHODS: The 11beta-HSD1 mRNA concentrations were measured in abdominal subcutaneous adipocytes (n=61) and skeletal muscle tissues (n=64). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the HSD11B1 gene were genotyped in a larger group of full-blooded Pima Indians. RESULTS: Two representative SNPs (SNP1, n=706; SNP5, n=839) were associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (p=0.01), although neither SNP was associated with obesity. Among subjects with normal glucose tolerance, SNP1 (n=127) and SNP5 (n=159) were associated with insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates (p=0.03 and p=0.04), and SNP1 was further associated with fasting, 30-min, and 2-h plasma insulin concentrations (p=0.002, p=0.002 and p=0.03). Adipocyte 11beta-HSD1 mRNA concentrations were correlated positively with adiposity and insulinaemia, and were additionally negatively correlated with insulin-mediated glucose uptake rates; nevertheless, the adipocyte 11beta-HSD1 expression did not correlate with genotypes of the donors. The muscle 11beta-HSD1 mRNA concentrations did not correlate with any anthropometric or metabolic variables. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We confirmed that adipocyte 11beta-HSD1 mRNA concentrations were associated with adiposity, and showed that genetic variations in the HSD11B1 gene were associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, plasma insulin concentrations and insulin action, independent of obesity. The variable adipose expression might not be a primary consequence of these HSD11B1 SNPs. Therefore, it is possible that the HSD11B1 gene is under tissue-specific regulation, and has tissue-specific consequences.
