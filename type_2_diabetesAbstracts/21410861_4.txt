 AIMS: In diabetes, endothelial damage promotes macroangiopathy and endothelial regeneration is impaired, owing to reduced endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Given that insulin influences endothelial biology, we compared the effects of add-on basal insulin analogues on endothelial damage and regeneration in type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: This was a 6-month randomized crossover trial comparing add-on insulin detemir versus glargine in poorly controlled T2D with macroangiopathy. At baseline, crossover (3 months) and study end (6 months), we measured HbA1c, EPCs, circulating endothelial cells (CECs), VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin. Body weight and hypoglycaemic episodes were also recorded. RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study, randomly assigned to the glargine-detemir (n = 21) or the detemir-glargine (n = 21) schedule. At crossover, EPC levels did not change compared with baseline, but significantly increased at study end. CECs decreased over time and were significantly reduced at study end. ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin were significantly reduced at crossover and further decreased at study end. No differences were seen in these effects between detemir and glargine. HbA1c showed a carryover effect and its reduction was similar with detemir and glargine in the first arm. Incidence of hypoglycaemia and weight gain was lower with detemir than with glargine in both arms. CONCLUSION: Optimized glycaemic control by add-on basal insulin improved indexes of endothelial damage and regeneration. Compared to glargine, detemir achieved similar endothelial protection with lower weight gain and less hypoglycaemia. These results might have implications for therapy of aging T2D patients with cardiovascular disease.
