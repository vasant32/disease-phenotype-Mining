We evaluated incretin secretion and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV activity in Korean type 2 diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic subjects. Type 2 diabetic patients showed intact GLP-1 and total GIP levels similar to those in non-diabetic subjects. Serum DPP-IV activity was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients (p=0.022).
