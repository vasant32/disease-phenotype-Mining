By 2030, it is predicted that type 2 diabetes will affect 4.4% of the world's population, an estimated 366 million individuals. Diabetic dyslipidemia is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is a major cause of premature mortality in type 2 diabetes. The management of diabetic dyslipidemia requires a multidisciplinary approach and the role of the nurse within the healthcare team is pivotal. Their broad remit positions nurses not only at the forefront of care, where they are well placed to recognize the clinical signs of the condition, but also as patient advisor, counselor, educator, monitor and motivator during the continuum of care. Poor concordance is a common problem for patients receiving multiple medications. Educating the patient about the importance of lifestyle change, and ensuring that lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are sustained are important components of effective care. Choosing therapies that enable patients to reach their treatment goals with a simple dosage regimen may also help to maximize patient concordance. Nurses must remain up to date with treatment options and management guidelines in order that they can communicate relevant information to patients, empowering them to make informed decisions about their health. Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-specific (SMART) goals should be set for each patient. This form of individualized care, in which the patient becomes fully engaged with their treatment plan and personal goals appear attainable, may help to reduce the projected burden of type 2 diabetes and its complications on healthcare services in the future.
