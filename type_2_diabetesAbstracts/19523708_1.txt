 OBJECTIVE: To investigate urinary excretion of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) during the different stages of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well as its clinical significance. METHODS: Sixty-five cases with T2DM were divided into three groups: normoalbuminuric group [N-UAlb; urine albumin excretion (UAE) <30 mg/24 h, n=25], microalbuminuric group [M-UAlb; UAE 30-300 mg/24 h, n=20], and macroalbuminuric group [L-UAlb; UAE >300 mg/ 24 h, n=20]. The urinary excretion rates of PDGF-BB were determined by a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in all the cases and 27 subjects of control. RESULTS: The excretion rates of PDGF-BB in T2DM groups were markedly higher than that in control (P<0.001). Moreover, the excretion rates of PDGF-BB increased with the increase of UAE and there were significant differences among the three groups (P<0.05) except the groups of M-UAlb and L-UAlb. Urinary PDGF-BB was also positively correlated with UAE, triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (CHO), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and negatively correlated with creatinine clearance (Ccr), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), while had no significance correlated with glycohemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). CONCLUSION: PDGF-BB might play a very important role in the initiation and progression of DN. Measurements of urine PDGF-BB in T2DM could be used for early diagnosis of diabetic renal dysfunction.
