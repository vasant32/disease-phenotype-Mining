 OBJECTIVE: Elevated plasma interleukin-18 (IL-18) has been linked to onset of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications. However, so far this association has been shown only in predominantly white populations. We examined IL-18 levels and their association with incident DM in a racially heterogeneous population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a nested case-cohort design representing a 9-year follow-up of 9,740 middle-aged, initially healthy, nondiabetic white and African American participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, we selected and measured analytes on race-stratified (50% white, 50% African American) random samples of both cases of incident diabetes (n = 548) and eligible members of the full cohort (n = 536). RESULTS Baseline IL-18 levels were significantly higher in white participants compared with African American participants (P < 0.001). Although white participants in the fourth (versus first) quartile of IL-18 levels had a significant hazard ratio (HR) for developing DM (HR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3-3.4), after adjustment for age, sex, and study center, no difference was seen among African Americans (HR: 1.0, 95% CI: 0.6-1.7). Unlike those in African Americans, IL-18 levels in whites had a significant correlation with age (P < 0.01); anthropometric characteristics such as waist circumference (P < 0.001), height (P = 0.04), waist-to-hip ratio (P < 0.001), and BMI (P < 0.01); and total (P < 0.001) and high-molecular-weight (P < 0.001) adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: There are racial differences in levels of IL-18 and the association of IL-18 with risk factors and incident type 2 DM. In addition, there seems to be a complex interplay of inflammation and adiposity in the development of DM.
