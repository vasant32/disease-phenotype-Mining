The assessment of markers of systemic inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL6), could be used to identify persons at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This study evaluates the relationship of CRP and IL6 with CHD risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with CHD and age and sex matched type 2 DM controls without CHD. CRP, IL-6, total plasma homocysteine (tHcy), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and sialic acid (SA) were determined in 55 type 2 diabetic patients with CHD and 51 age- and sex-matched type 2 diabetic controls without CHD. Multivariate and logistic regression analyses were used to relate these markers with CHD risk factors. CRP (P=0.02) and tHcy (P=0.03) were significantly higher in patients with CHD compared with the control group even after correction for age and sex. IL6, Lp(a), SA and lipid parameters were not significantly different between the two groups of patients. After adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratio (OR) for elevated CRP was 2.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.58) (P=0.02) but the OR for IL6 was 3.41 95% CI, 0.70-17.17 (P=0.14). Partial correlation analyses of CRP and IL6 with other variables showed significant correlation of CRP with tHcy, and SA in patients with CHD only. Our results support the inclusion of CRP (high-sensitivity assay), in the risk assessment of diabetic subjects.
