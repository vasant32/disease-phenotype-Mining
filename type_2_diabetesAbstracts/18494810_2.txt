Hypertension increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. In addition to lowering blood pressure, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) reduces the risk of new-onset T2DM and offers renal protection. Using a MEDLINE search, we identified multiple trials that reported the incidence of T2DM in patients taking inhibitors of RAAS. In this review, we will discuss the RAAS as a potential target in diabetes prevention and the mechanisms through which inhibitors of this system achieve such an important effect. We will also shed light on the beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects of RAAS blockade. Although multiple studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of RAAS, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, can reduce the incidence of T2DM, randomized controlled studies are still needed to further elucidate their exact role in diabetes prevention.
