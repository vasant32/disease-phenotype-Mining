 AIM: To evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of biphasic insulin aspart (BIAsp) 30 twice daily (b.i.d.) vs. BIAsp 50 or BIAsp 70 (high-mix regimens) thrice daily (t.i.d.) all in combination with metformin in a 36-week clinical trial in subjects with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Efficacy measurements included haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and eight-point plasma glucose (PG); safety included adverse events (AEs) and hypoglycaemic episodes. The three treatment groups (approximately 200 subjects in each group) were well matched regarding sex ratio, ethnicity, age and body mass index. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, 43% and 54% in the BIAsp 50 and 70 groups, respectively, switched their dinner insulin to BIAsp 30. Both high-mix regimens were non-inferior to BIAsp 30 b.i.d., as measured by change in HbA(1c), and the BIAsp %50 regimen was superior. The odds for meeting the American Diabetes Association and The American Association of Clin√≠cal Endocrinologist HbA(1c) targets of <7% and < or =6.5%, respectively, were significantly higher with the BIAsp 50 regimen than with BIAsp 30. A significantly lower PG level was achieved from lunch until 02:00 hours with both high-mix regimens compared with BIAsp 30 b.i.d. AEs were mild or moderate with all three regimens. Frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes was comparable for the BIAsp 50 and the BIAsp 30 b.i.d. regimens but was significantly higher with BIAsp 70 t.i.d. CONCLUSIONS: Glycaemic control improved with BIAsp 50 t.i.d. without higher incidence of hypoglycaemia compared with BIAsp 30 b.i.d.; with BIAsp 70 t.i.d. lower PG levels from lunch to 02.00 hours, but more hypoglycaemic episodes were obtained compared with BIAsp 30 b.i.d.
