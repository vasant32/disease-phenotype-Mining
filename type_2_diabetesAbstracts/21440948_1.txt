A randomized, crossover study compared the effects of atorvastatin, gemfibrozil and their combination on inflammatory markers in type 2 diabetes. C-reactive protein (CRP), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), interleukin 8 (IL8), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were measured. Both lipid-lowering drugs had positive, complementary and additive effects on inflammatory markers, which were closely related to baseline inflammatory status.
