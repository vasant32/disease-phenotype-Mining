 OBJECTIVE: To review insulin detemir for clinical use to better manage patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A MEDLINE search, in English, from June 30, 2006 to December 1, 2008, using the terms "insulin analogs," "insulin detemir" and "long-acting insulin analog." RESULTS: Insulin detemir improves glycemic control, based on HbA(1C) reduction and fasting glucose levels, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Insulin detemir has lower glycemic variability, with less intra-subject variability in blood glucose levels in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. When added to oral anti-diabetes agents (OADs) in type 2 diabetes, insulin detemir demonstrates superiority to other basal insulin options. CONCLUSION: Insulin detemir appears to provide better glycemic control with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and less weight gain in the treatment of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
