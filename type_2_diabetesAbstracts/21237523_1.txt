Among 4164 patients, those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) had lower lung diffusion capacity (DLCO) compared with those without DM (DLCO mean±SE: 15.7±0.3 vs. 17.0±0.2 mL/min/mm Hg, p<0.01). Reduced DLCO predicted hospitalization for pneumonia independent of diabetes control, severity and co-morbidities (OR=2.4, CI 1.08-5.31).
