 PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare functional capacity in 30 Type 2 Diabetic patients with 30 healthy non-diabetic control subjects. METHODS: Physical fitness was evaluated using the "EUROFIT Physical Fitness Test Battery". This battery estimates body composition, cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and motor fitness. RESULTS: Percentage of body fat (PBF) was higher in the diabetic compared with control groups (P<0.05) although body mass index (BMI) was similar. Biceps and suprailiac skinfold thickness were also greater in the diabetic group (P<0.05). The 6-min walking distance and VO(2max) were significantly lower in the diabetic group (P<0.05). The diabetic patients had lower values of the single leg balance test with eyes opened and closed. Jump-stretch, handgrip and side-bending of trunk tests were also lower in the diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: Physical functional capacity is lower in Type 2 diabetic patients than in age-matched control subjects.
