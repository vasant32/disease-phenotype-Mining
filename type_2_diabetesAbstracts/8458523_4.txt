It has been suggested that increased glucose/glucose 6-phosphate substrate cycling impairs net hepatic glucose uptake in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and contributes to hyperglycaemia. To investigate glucose/glucose 6-phosphate cycle activity and insulin action in Type 2 diabetes we studied eight patients and eight healthy control subjects, using the euglycaemic glucose clamp and isotope dilution techniques with purified [2-3H]- and [6-3H] glucose tracers, in the post-absorptive state and eight patients and five healthy control subjects during consecutive insulin infusions at rates of 0.4 and 2.0 mU.kg-1 x min-1. [2-3H]glucose and [6-3H]glucose radioactivity in plasma samples were determined using selective enzymatic detritiation, allowing calculation of glucose turnover rates for each isotope, the difference being glucose/glucose 6-phosphate cycling. Endogenous glucose production ([6-3H]glucose) was greater in diabetic than control subjects in the post-absorptive state (15.6 +/- 1.5 vs 11.3 +/- 0.4 mumol.kg-1 x min-1, p < 0.05) and during the 0.4 mU insulin infusion (10.1 +/- 1.3 vs 5.2 +/- 0.3 mumol.kg-1 x min-1, p < 0.01) indicating hepatic insulin resistance. Glucose/glucose 6-phosphate cycling was significantly greater in diabetic than in control subjects in the post-absorptive state (2.6 +/- 0.4 vs 1.6 +/- 0.2 mumol.kg-1 x min-1, p < 0.05) but not during the 0.4 mU insulin infusion (2.0 +/- 0.4 vs 2.0 +/- 0.3 mumol.kg-1 x min-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
