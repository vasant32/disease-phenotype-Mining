AIM: Diabetic xerostomia is a typical syndrome in diabetic complication. We have reported that salivatin (salivary peptide P-C) derived from human saliva potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin release and inhibits arginine-stimulated glucagon release. The present study is aimed to gain further evidence on the physiological role by investigating the diabetic state-induced change in the amount of salivatin. METHODS: The amount of salivatin was measured in saliva taken from patients with type 2 diabetes with ELISA and with rabbit antiserum against human salivatin immunocytochemically in sections of parotid glands from streptozotocin-diabetic BALB/c mice. RESULTS: The amount of salivatin after a meal was reduced by diabetes in both human saliva and in the serous secretory granule of mouse parotid gland acinar cells. CONCLUSIONS: The above results suggest that salivatin lowers hyperglycaemia after meal and sustains the normal blood glucose levels by incretin-like mechanisms. The function may be damaged by diabetes, and this in turn might make the diabetes worse.
