 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Sedentary offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes are often more insulin-resistant than persons with no family history of diabetes, but when active or fit offspring of type 2 diabetic patients are compared with non-diabetic persons, differences in insulin resistance are less evident. This study aimed to determine the effects of an exercise training intervention on insulin sensitivity in both groups. METHODS: Women offspring (n = 34) of type 2 diabetic patients (offspring age 35.6 +/- 7.0 years, BMI 28.1 +/- 5.1 kg/m(2)) and 36 matched female controls (age 33.6 +/- 6.1 years, BMI 27.3 +/- 4.7 kg/m(2)) participated. Body composition, fitness and metabolic measurements were made at baseline and after a controlled 7 week exercise intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was 22% lower in offspring than controls (p < 0.05), despite similar body fat and maximal oxygen uptake (.VO(2max)) values in the two groups. ISI increased by 23% (p < 0.05) in offspring following the exercise intervention, compared with 7% (NS) in the controls. Increases in .VO(2max) were similar in both groups (controls 12%, offspring 15%, p < 0.05 for both). Plasma leptin concentrations decreased significantly in the offspring (-24%, p < 0.01) but not in controls (0%, NS). Change in ISI correlated significantly with baseline ISI (r = -0.47, p < 0.0005) and change in leptin (r = -0.43, p < 0.0005). The latter relationship was not attenuated by adjustment for changes in body fat. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Offspring, but not controls, significantly increased ISI in response to an exercise intervention, indicating that insulin sensitivity is more highly modulated by physical activity in daughters of patients with type 2 diabetes than in women with no family history of the disease.
