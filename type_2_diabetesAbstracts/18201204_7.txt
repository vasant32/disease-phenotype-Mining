Exendin-4 is a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)-resistant glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) mimetic and its synthetic counterpart, exenatide, is being used in the therapy of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). No information, however, is currently available as for the direct action of exendin-4 on human T2DM islets. In the present study, we exposed pancreatic islets prepared from non-diabetic and T2DM subjects to exendin-4 for 48 h and found that the compound had several, direct beneficial actions on insulin secretion and the expression of genes involved in beta-cell function and differentiation.
