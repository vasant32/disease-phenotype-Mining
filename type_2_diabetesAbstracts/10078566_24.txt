Paraoxonase is an HDL-associated enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by protecting lipoproteins against peroxidation. Its biallelic gene polymorphism at codon 192 (glutamine/arginine) has been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). To further evaluate the role of this paraoxonase gene polymorphism for CAD in type 2 diabetes, we determined the paraoxonase genotype in 288 type 2 diabetic patients (170 with and 118 without angiographically documented CAD). The paraoxonase 192 Gln/Arg genotype was assessed using polymerase chain reaction followed by AlwI digestion. The frequency of the Gln allele was 0.656 in the CAD patients and 0.746 in the controls (chi2 = 5.36, P = 0.02). Compared with the Gln/Gln genotypes, the age-adjusted odds ratio for CAD was 1.78 (95% CI 1.08-2.96, P = 0.02) in subjects carrying at least one Arg allele. In the multivariate analysis, this association was even stronger after correction for the possible confounders age, sex, smoking history, and hypertension. Among current and former smokers, the odds ratio (OR) for having CAD among patients with at least one Arg allele was 3.58 (1.45-9.53, P < 0.01). The paraoxonase Arg allele was not associated with the history of myocardial infarction (OR 1.20 [0.73-1.99, NS]), but was with the extent of CAD (OR for three-vessel disease 1.92 [1.15-3.27, P = 0.01]). Our data indicate that the 192 Arg allele of the human paraoxonase gene is a risk factor for CAD but not myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic patients, a risk factor further modified by cigarette smoking. This risk could possibly be explained by a reduced ability of the paraoxonase Arg isoform to protect lipoproteins against peroxidation.
