Insulin therapy is often essential in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but is typically not initiated early enough or aggressive enough, leading to worsening of glycaemic control and the majority of people staying above recommended haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) targets of <7%. The extensive clinical experience gained with insulin glargine, in particular, the low risk of hypoglycaemia and consistent improvements in HbA(1c), suggests that insulin glargine can be initiated aggressively to help patients reach such HbA(1c) targets. However, many clinicians may be unaware of how easy it is to initiate insulin glargine. Indeed, the once-daily injection of insulin glargine plus once-daily measurement of blood glucose should provide little difficulty for patients. In the current review, the options for the initiation of insulin glargine in T2DM and how the patient can become more involved in management of their diabetes are discussed. The advantages of insulin glargine in randomized controlled trials and how these have translated into everyday clinical practice are also discussed.
