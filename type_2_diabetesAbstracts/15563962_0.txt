By screening 204 diabetes patients, a male with age 38 was found to have increased C-peptide levels in plasma (over 6 ng/ml) and urine (430 microg/day), both of which were the highest among the screened subjects. He developed type 2 diabetes at age 31, without history of obesity (weight was 52 kg and height 170 cm). He had bilateral testicular atrophy. Fasting plasma glucose level was 160 mg/dl and HbA1c was 8% at age 38. There was hypertriglycemia (290-662 mg/dl). There were no abnormal peaks of IRI or CPR in the serum fractionated by gel filtration (Biogel P 30). Molar ratio of p-CPR/s-IRI was 10.8. Islet cell antibody, anti-insulin binding antibody and anti-insulin receptor antibody were negative. LSH and FSH were both elevated, and free testosterone was decreased. TSH and Leptin levels were elevated. Other laboratory data were within normal range. CT scan revealed fatty liver and horse-shoe kidney. These clinical pictures do not match the criteria to known syndromes associated with diabetes. Although the single case report is insufficient to discuss the C-peptide mechanism of action, this case may give us a hint to understand an aspect of the pathophysiology of C-peptide's bioactivity dysfunction.
