Plasma endothelin-1, the nitric oxide (NO) mediator intraplatelet cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), the prostacyclin mediator cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the macrophage derived inflammatory mediator plasma neopterin were measured in men with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=91), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; n=51), previously abnormal glucose tolerance (PAGT; n=20), and 34 healthy control men. Plasma endothelin-1was higher in men with Type 2 diabetes mellitus than in controls [4.1 (1.0-14.3) vs. 2.1 (0.2-8. 7) ng/l; P<0.001). Intraplatelet cGMP was higher in men with PAGT [0. 84 (0.57-2.76) pmol/10(9) platelets; P<0.05], IGT [0.85 (0.48-3.53); P<0.001] and Type 2 diabetes mellitus [0.90 (0.47-3.86); P<0.001] than in controls [0.70 (0.42-1.70]. No differences existed between groups concerning intraplatelet cAMP or plasma neopterin. Plasma endothelin-1 correlated with fasting plasma glucose (r=0.33; P<0.001) and HbA1(c) (r=0.29; P<0.001). In conclusion, elevated plasma endothelin-1 in Type 2 diabetes mellitus and its relationship to glucose and HbA1(c) suggest a putative role for endothelin-1 in diabetic endothelial cell damage. Increased cGMP indicating enhanced production/activity of NO suggests that factors other than reduced NO activity contribute to enhanced platelet aggregation in diabetes.
