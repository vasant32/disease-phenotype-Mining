 AIMS: Media calcification is a predictor of cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Undercarboxylation of some vitamin K-dependent proteins, due to genetic polymorphisms of VKORC1, can lead to calcification. We examined a potential association between VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism and T2DM and, also, the association of this polymorphism with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT). METHODS: VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism was determined in 299 T2DM patients and 328 controls of Caucasian origin using PCR-RFLP. cIMT was measured in a subgroup of 118 T2DM patients. RESULTS: The frequency of VKORC1 genotypes between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects differed significantly (p=0.01). VKORC1 genotype was associated with T2DM in an adjusted model (OR 1.36, p=0.009). A statistically significant difference was observed in the maximum value of cIMT among different genotypes. VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism was an independent predictor of cIMT (p=0.029) after adjusting for established risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The association between VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism and risk of T2DM could be due to the higher prevalence of calcification in T2DM patients. This is supported by the independent association between VKORC1 -1639 G>A polymorphism and maximum cIMT in T2DM patients which is likely due to atherosclerosis characterized by increased calcification.
