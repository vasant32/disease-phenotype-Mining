The serum concentration of 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), a polyol which originates mainly in the diet, is used in Japan as a new marker for glycemia. To evaluate the potential interference of 1, 5-AG measurements by traditional Chinese medicines (Kampo), we examined the 1,5-AG content in 32 types of concentrated dosage forms of Kampo using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The 32 types of Kampo were the most frequently used in Japan, two of which, Ninjin-yoei-to (7030 microg/g dry weight) and Kami-kihi-to (6700 microg/g dry weight), contained large amounts of 1,5-AG. Six others contained small amounts of 1,5-AG. Both Ninjin-yoei-to and Kami-kihi-to contain the same ingredient, Polygalae radix, which is a crude form of polygalitol (1,5-AG). To confirm the effects of these Kampo medicines on the serum levels of 1,5-AG, we administered Ninjin-yoei-to (7.5 g/day) for 8 weeks to 18 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (Type 2 DM). The serum level of 1,5-AG increased from 9.8+/-8.9 to 28.1+/-17.5 microg/ml by week 8. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) had not changed by week 8. Thus, an abnormal serum 1,5-AG level may be present in patients taking Kampo which contains Polygalae radix.
