A total of 136 type 2 diabetic patients with nonproliferative and 94 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) without nephropathy were studied. The DD genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism was more common in the PDR group (P<0.001). In multivariate regression, the association remained significant (OR=3.516).
