 OBJECTIVE: Because diabetes is the most frequent factor responsible for microvascular and macrovascular disease, we investigated angiogenin serum levels within the diabetic patient group. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated 49 patients who met the criteria to be in the diabetic group. Forty nondiabetic patients were included in the control group. We set A1C <7% as well-controlled diabetes. Serum angiogenin level was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. RESULTS: Serum angiogenin levels of poorly controlled patients with type 2 diabetes were significantly lower than those of group with well-controlled diabetes (361.23 +/- 126.03 ng/ml vs. 446.37 +/- 134.10 ng/ml; P = 0.001). Moreover, they were characterized by a significantly longer duration of the disease (P = 0.006), higher BMI (P = 0.0003), and higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.01). Levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL were not significantly different in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (A1C >7%) have lower angiogenin levels than patients with well-controlled diabetes.
