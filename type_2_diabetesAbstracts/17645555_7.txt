OBJECTIVE: To quantify adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of metformin (MET), sulphonylureas (SUs) and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in a usual care setting, and to assess the relationship of AEs to treatment patterns and glycaemic response in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN and METHODS: An electronic medical record database was used to identify patients with type 2 diabetes age >or=18 years from 1996 to 2005. Patients na√Øve to oral antidiabetic therapy were followed for 395 days postinitiation of MET, SU or TZD treatment. AEs related to study drugs were evaluated during the follow-up period. Baseline and follow-up A1C levels were compared by drug regimen. Associations between the change in A1C, drug regimen changes and AEs were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 14,512 patients (mean age 60.8 years, 52.9% female) were identified. During the follow-up period, 12.7% of patients experienced an AE (8.6% MET, 15.9% SU and 19.8% TZD patients). SU and TZD patients were more likely to experience an AE than MET (p < 0.001) patients. AEs did not significantly influence A1C outcomes, although MET and SU patients experiencing an AE were more likely to add-on therapy (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34 and OR = 1.37, respectively; p < 0.05) than those without an AE. MET patients with AEs were more likely to switch therapy (OR = 1.91; p < 0.05) than those without an AE. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of AEs did not significantly impact glycaemic response to therapy. However, AEs may lead to greater treatment switches for patients receiving MET and add-on therapy for MET-treated and SU-treated patients.
