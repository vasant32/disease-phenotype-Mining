The long-acting effect of a 10-min pulse infusion of the beta 2-adrenergic agonist fenoterol on oral glucose tolerance tests in controls and in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on diet was compared. During an oral glucose load starting 2 h after fenoterol control persons showed hyperglycemia (area: 25,950 +/- 467 vs. 22,650 +/- 410, P less than 0.01), hyperinsulinemia (area: 13,980 +/- 1050 vs. 8160 +/- 405, P less than 0.02) and a pronounced fall of serum potassium (area: 775 +/- 26 vs. 748 +/- 25, P less than 0.02). The patient group showed no late response to fenoterol: plasma glucose (area: 51,000 +/- 382 vs. 51,300 +/- 413, n.s.), serum insulin (area: 7215 +/- 233 vs. 8280 +/- 410, n.s.), serum potassium (area: 748 +/- 26 vs. 750 +/- 24, n.s.). The data show that there is a defect of the beta 2-adrenergic long-acting effect on glucose metabolism and on insulin release in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
