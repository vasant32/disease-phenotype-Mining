To add to the discussion whether higher normal range fasting plasma glucose levels or "IFG" may be able to predict the risk to develop type 2 diabetes we tested in 294 healthy middle-age persons during a mean follow up time of 3.8 years which range of fasting glucose levels allowed to predict type 2 diabetes. A significant increase in frequency of IGT/diabetes was significantly observed for the "IFG" category. We therefore conclude that elevated fasting glucose levels in the "IFG" category predict the development of IGT/diabetes in a middle-age population.
