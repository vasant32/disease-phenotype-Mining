OBJECTIVE: We have shown that a positive family history of diabetes, and the variables of general and central obesity are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes in our population. This study was done to evaluate whether a familial predisposition to diabetes resulted in a tendency for adverse anthropometric and haemodynamic profiles in south Indian non-diabetic subjects. METHODS: The analysis was carried out on 2463 subjects (M: F, 1196: 1267) with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). The study subjects were selected from population surveys for diabetes. Details of age, sex, family history of diabetes, body mass index (b.m.i.), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and blood pressure were recorded. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides were estimated. RESULTS: A positive family history of diabetes was present in 24.7% of our subjects. Mean b.m.i. and percentage of obesity were significantly higher in families with a positive family history (group 2) vs. families with no family history (group 1). Subjects in group 2 had a higher 2-h plasma glucose (p < 0.001) and higher prevalence of hypertension (chi2 = 6.91, p = 0.0086). Factor analysis with principle components analysis (PCA) showed that a family history of diabetes clustered with WHR in men, and with b.m.i. and WHR in women. The b.m.i. formed a different domain with blood pressure in both sexes. WHR and b.m.i. clustered with cholesterol and triglycerides in another domain. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, general and central obesity are associated with a family history of diabetes. A family history of diabetes may increase the risk of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia indirectly through its connection with b.m.i.
