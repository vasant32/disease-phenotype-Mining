 OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, added to ongoing metformin therapy, were assessed in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control (HbA(1c) [A1C] >or=7 and <or=10%) with metformin alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After a screening diet/exercise run-in period, a metformin dose titration/stabilization period, and a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 701 patients, aged 19-78 years, with mild to moderate hyperglycemia (mean A1C 8.0%) receiving ongoing metformin (>or=1,500 mg/day) were randomly assigned to receive the addition of placebo or sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily in a 1:2 ratio for 24 weeks. Patients exceeding specific glycemic limits were provided rescue therapy (pioglitazone) until the end of the study. The efficacy analyses were based on an all-patients-treated population using an ANCOVA and excluded data obtained after glycemic rescue. RESULTS: At week 24, sitagliptin treatment led to significant reductions compared with placebo in A1C (-0.65%), fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h postmeal glucose. Fasting insulin, fasting C-peptide, fasting proinsulin-to-insulin ratio, postmeal insulin and C-peptide areas under the curve (AUCs), postmeal insulin AUC-to-glucose AUC ratio, homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index were significantly improved with sitagliptin relative to placebo. A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved an A1C <7% with sitagliptin (47.0%) than with placebo (18.3%). There was no increased risk of hypoglycemia or gastrointestinal adverse experiences with sitagliptin compared with placebo. Body weight decreased similarly with sitagliptin and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily added to ongoing metformin therapy was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control with metformin alone.
