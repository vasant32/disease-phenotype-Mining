The impact of several environmental and genetic factors on diabetes and its complications is well documented. The present study was aimed to examine the serum levels of IL-17A and IFN-gamma as antagonistic cytokines in nephropathic and non-nephropathic type-2 diabetic patients. In this experimental study, serum samples were obtained from 180 type-2 diabetic patients, 100 nephropathic type-2 diabetic patients and 100 healthy controls. Serum levels of IL-17A and IFN-gamma was detected by ELISA. Results of this study showed that the serum level of IFN-gamma was higher in both diabetic patients (nephropathic and non-nephropathic) in comparison to the controls. In terms of IL-17A, while non-nephropathic type-2 diabetic patients showed an increased serum level of it, the other patients group had a lower serum level. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the lower serum level of IL-17A is possibly associated with nephropathic complications of type-2 diabetes.
