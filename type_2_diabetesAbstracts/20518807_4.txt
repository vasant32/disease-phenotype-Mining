 AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of taranabant in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in overweight and obese patients with T2DM (ages > or = 18 and < or = 75 years) with a BMI > or = 27 kg/m(2) and < or = 43 kg/m(2) and HbA1c > or =7.0 and < or = 10.0%, who were either not on an antihyperglycaemic agent or on a stable dose of metformin (> or = 1500 mg/day). After a 2-week placebo run-in, patients were randomized to placebo (N = 156) or taranabant 0.5-mg (N = 155), 1-mg (N = 157), or 2-mg (N = 155) once daily for 52 weeks. Primary efficacy endpoints were changes from baseline in body weight (BW) and HbA1c at Week 36, with results at Week 52 being key secondary endpoints. RESULTS: In the all-patients-treated population, using a last-observation-carried-forward analysis, reductions in BW were -2.5, -3.7, -4.5 and -5.1 kg at Week 36 and -2.4, -4.0, -4.6 and -5.3 kg at Week 52 in the placebo, 0.5-, 1- and 2-mg groups, respectively (all doses significant vs. placebo at both time points). The proportion of patients who lost > or = 5 and > or = 10% of their baseline BW was significantly greater in the 1- and 2-mg groups vs. placebo at Week 36 and all taranabant groups vs. placebo at Week 52. Reductions in HbA1c were -0.40, -0.47, -0.68 and -0.71% at Week 36 and -0.30, -0.43, -0.65 and -0.64% at Week 52, in the placebo, 0.5-, 1- and 2-mg groups, respectively (1- and 2-mg doses significant vs. placebo at both time points). After 52 weeks, the incidences of adverse experiences classified in the gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting), nervous system-related (dizziness, sensory-related), and psychiatric (irritability, depression-related) organ systems were numerically higher or statistically significantly higher in all taranabant groups compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: After 36 and 52 weeks, treatment with taranabant at the 1- and 2-mg doses led to clinically significant weight loss and improvement in glycaemic parameters in overweight and obese patients with T2DM that was associated with dose-related increases in adverse experiences. Based on these data and data from other Phase III clinical studies, it was determined that the overall safety and efficacy profile of taranabant did not support further development for the treatment of obesity.
