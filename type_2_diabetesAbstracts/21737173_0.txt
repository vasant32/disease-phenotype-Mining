The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of Syzygium cumini leaf extract (ASc), on Adenosine deaminase (ADA) and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, and also on oxidative stress parameters in erythrocytes hemolysates (RBCs) and erythrocytes membranes (ghosts) from type 2 diabetics patients (Type 2 DM) under in vitro conditions. Non protein thiol groups (NP-SH), AChE, Catalase (CAT) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activities were measure in RBCs. Further, ADA activity, Thiobarbituric Acid-Reactive Substances (TBARS) levels and protein thiol groups (P-SH) were estimated in ghosts. Also, P-SH and Vitamin C (VIT C) were measure in plasma sample. The results demonstrated that ADA and AChE activities, besides TBARS levels were higher in erythrocytes of Type 2 DM, while SOD activity and NP-SH levels were decreased when compared to control group. ASc, in vitro, reduced ADA and AChE activities and some parameters of oxidative stress. Furthermore, we observed correlations between VIT C and P-SH levels, ADA activity and P-SH levels, as well as NP-SH and TBARS levels in diabetics. The results suggest that ASc in vitro is able to promote the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress parameters, and act against biochemical changes occurring in Diabetes mellitus (DM).
