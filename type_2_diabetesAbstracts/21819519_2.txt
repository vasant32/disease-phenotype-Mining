 AIMS: Mixed dyslipidaemia, characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and high levels of triglycerides, is common in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or metabolic syndrome. Dalcetrapib effectively increases HDL-C levels by modulating cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the lipid modifying efficacy and safety of dalcetrapib in patients with T2DM and/or metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of dalcetrapib therapy in five placebo-controlled, Phase II trials (4-48 weeks of duration) involving T2DM and/or metabolic syndrome, in dyslipidaemic patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalent. RESULTS: Both in patients with and without T2DM and/or metabolic syndrome, dalcetrapib decreased CETP activity by 26-58% and increased HDL-C levels by 23-34%, depending on dose and duration of treatment. Dalcetrapib did not significantly affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or apolipoprotein B levels. Treatment with dalcetrapib was generally well tolerated with a similar number of adverse events reported between patient groups and between those receiving dalcetrapib compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Dalcetrapib similarly decreased CETP activity and increased HDL-C levels in patients with and without T2DM or metabolic syndrome; the ongoing Phase III dal-OUTCOMES study will help to determine if dalcetrapib's improvement in lipid levels also reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
