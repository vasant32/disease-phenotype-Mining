 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of perilipin gene (PLIN) polymorphisms on weight gain with rosiglitazone treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 160 type 2 diabetic patients were treated with rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) for 12 weeks in addition to their previous medications, which were unchanged. Four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the PLIN locus were genotyped: PLIN 6209T>C, PLIN 11482G>A, PLIN 13041A>G, and PLIN 14995A>T. RESULTS: Although fasting plasma glucose and HbA(1c) levels decreased; mean body weight increased significantly after rosiglitazone treatment. Among the four SNPs tested, only the PLIN 11482G>A polymorphism was associated with weight gain from rosiglitazone treatment. In addition, there was a significant difference in the increase in the body weight among the genotypes. Patients with the 11482A/A genotype showed less increase in body weight than those with other genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that genetic variations in the perilipin gene can affect weight gain associated with rosiglitazone treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.
