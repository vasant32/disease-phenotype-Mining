Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-specific protein with insulin-sensitizing and antiatherogenic properties. Therefore, the adiponectin gene is a promising candidate gene for type 2 diabetes. We investigated the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) +45T/G and +276G/T of the adiponectin gene as predictors for the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes in the STOP-NIDDM trial, which aimed to investigate the effect of acarbose compared with placebo on the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Compared with the TT genotype, the G-allele of SNP +45 was associated with a 1.8-fold risk for type 2 diabetes (95% CI 1.12-3.00, P = 0.015) in the placebo group. Subjects treated with placebo and simultaneously having the G-allele of SNP +45 and the T-allele of SNP +276 (the risk genotype combination) had a 4.5-fold (1.78-11.3, P = 0.001) higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with subjects carrying neither of these alleles. Women carrying the risk genotype combination had an especially high risk of conversion to diabetes (odds ratio 22.2, 95% CI 2.7-183.3, P = 0.004). In conclusion, the G-allele of SNP +45 is a predictor for the conversion to type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the combined effect of SNP +45 and SNP +276 on the development of type 2 diabetes was stronger than that of each SNP alone.
