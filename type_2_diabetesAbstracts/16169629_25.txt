In this study, we examined the effects of green tea on inflammation and arterial stiffness in type 2 diabetes patients. As results, inflammatory markers, such as hsCRP and IL-6, were unchanged after green tea consumption, and neither were blood glucose, lipid profiles, insulin resistance, or serum adiponectin levels. Furthermore, tea consumption did not improve baPWV. These results suggest that the above-described mechanisms are unlikely to explain the cardiovascular risk reduction by tea consumption observed in epidemiological studies.
