 OBJECTIVE: International guidelines recommend optimal control of risk factors in diabetes to prevent cardiovascular events. We examined risk associations between achieving treatment targets for glycemia, blood pressure and lipid control, and other risk factors on subsequent cardiovascular events in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2005, 6,386 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients without a history of coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke were recruited. They were classified according to the number of treatment targets attained at baseline, and their cardiovascular outcomes were compared. Treatment targets were defined as A1C <7.0%, blood pressure <130/80 mmHg, and LDL cholesterol <2.6 mmol/l. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5.7 years, cumulative incidence of CHD or stroke (n = 749) increased with decreasing numbers of treatment targets attained at baseline. Attainment of two or more targets at baseline was associated with reduced risk of CHD compared with those with no target achieved (hazard ratio 0.69 [95% CI 0.50-0.94], P = 0.020). However, the association lost its significance after adjustment for urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and hemoglobin. CONCLUSIONS: Reaching more treatment targets was associated with reduced risk of new onset of CHD in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.
