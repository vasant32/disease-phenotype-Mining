 AIM: To evaluate the prevalence and predictors of microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetics in Oman. METHODS: All patients attending an outpatient diabetic clinic at the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital between 2002 and 2003 were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: A total of 261 patients were included in this study. The mean overall age of the cohort was 50+/-13 years, and 57% were male. The proportion of subjects who had microalbuminuria was 27% (n=70; N=261). The logistic regression model indicated that significant predictors for the development of microalbuminuria include HbA(1c), log creatinine, and the presence of hypertension. A one unit increase in HbA(1c) was associated with a 23% increase in the odds of developing microalbuminuria (OR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.10-1.37; p<0.001). Additionally, patients that had a one unit increase in log creatinine were 5.72 times more likely to develop microalbuminuria (OR 5.72; 95% CI: 1.86-17.59; p=0.002). Furthermore, patients who were hypertensive were 2.37 times more likely to have microalbuminuria (OR 2.37; 95% CI: 1.11-5.09; p=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes in this study was 27%. Significant predictors of microalbuminuria included HbA(1c), creatinine, and the presence of hypertension.
