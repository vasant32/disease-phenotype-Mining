 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effect of exercise consultation on physical activity and resultant physiological and biochemical variables at 6 months in people with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 70 inactive people with type 2 diabetes were given standard exercise information and were randomized to receive an exercise consultation (n = 35) or not (n = 35). Exercise consultation, based on the transtheoretical model, combines motivational theory and cognitive behavioral strategies into an individualized intervention to promote physical activity. Changes from baseline to 6 months were assessed in 1) physical activity (7-day recall, accelerometer, cardiorespiratory fitness, stage, and processes of change), 2) physiological variables (blood pressure and BMI), and 3) biochemical variables (HbA(1c), lipid profile, and fibrinogen). RESULTS: Between-group differences were recorded for the change in minutes of moderate activity (P < 0.001) and activity counts (P < 0.001) per week. Experimental participants recorded an increase in activity counts per week and minutes of moderate activity per week (P < 0.001). The control group recorded no significant changes. More experimental participants increased stage of change (chi(2) = 22.6, P < 0.001). Between-group differences were recorded for the change in total exercise duration and peak gradient (P < 0.005), HbA(1c) (P = 0.02), systolic BP (P = 0.02), and fibrinogen (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise consultation increased physical activity and improved glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes.
