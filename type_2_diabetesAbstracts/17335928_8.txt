 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the selected components of the oxidative/antioxidative system in T2DM; estimation of relationships between them; search for the more expressive one and examine their alterations in angiopathy and obesity. METHODS: In 94 diabetic patients and 36 healthy people, plasma levels of TRAP, as a marker of antioxidative defence, as well as concentrations of CO, SH, and NH(2) groups and AOPP, as markers of oxidative protein damage (OPD) were determined. RESULTS: Patients had significantly lower levels of TRAP and SH groups, as well as higher NH(2), CO and AOPP in comparison to control. Significant correlation was observed between TRAP and SH groups and AOPP as well as between AOPP and SH and CO groups. Concentration of AOPP was significantly higher in the macroangiopathy and obese subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the idea that diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder with oxidant/antioxidant defence disturbances. Among the studied parameters AOPP showed the most expressive raise in plasma of diabetic patients and significant differences between their subgroups with vascular complications and overweight. We can conclude that AOPP seems to be considered as a useful marker to estimate the degree of OPD in diabetic patients.
