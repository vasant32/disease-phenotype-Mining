 OBJECTIVE: Weight loss in type 2 diabetes is undisputedly important, and data from community settings are limited. We evaluated weight change and resulting glycemic and blood pressure control in type 2 diabetic patients at an HMO. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using electronic medical records, this retrospective cohort study identified 2,574 patients aged 21-75 years who received a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes between 1997 and 2002. We estimated 3-year weight trajectories using growth curve analyses, grouped similar trajectories into four categories using cluster analysis, compared category characteristics, and predicted year-4 above-goal A1C and blood pressure by group. RESULTS: The weight-trajectory groups were defined as higher stable weight (n = 418; 16.2%), lower stable weight (n = 1,542; 59.9%), weight gain (n = 300; 11.7%), and weight loss (n = 314; 12.2%). The latter had a mean weight loss of 10.7 kg (-9.8%; P < 0.001) by 18 months, with near-complete regain by 36 months. After adjusting for age, sex, baseline control, and related medication use, those with higher stable weight, lower stable weight, or weight-gain patterns were more likely than those who lost weight to have above-goal A1C (odds ratio [OR] 1.66 [95% CI 1.12-2.47], 1.52 [1.08-2.14], and 1.77 [1.15-2.72], respectively). Those with higher stable weight or weight-gain patterns were more likely than those who lost weight to have above-goal blood pressure (1.83 [1.31-2.57] and 1.47 [1.03-2.10], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A weight-loss pattern after new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes predicted improved glycemic and blood pressure control despite weight regain. The initial period postdiagnosis may be a critical time to apply weight-loss treatments to improve risk factor control.
