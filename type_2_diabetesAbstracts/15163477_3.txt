 OBJECTIVE: To establish the normal distribution for glycohemoglobin (A1C) in sixth and seventh grade children and to assess the practicality of a school-based fingerstick screening program. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fingerstick capillary whole blood was collected from 400 children aged 11 to 13 years and the percent A1C was determined on-site. RESULTS: Among the boys, the A1C was significantly higher among the minorities (4.88+/-0.37%, mean+/-S.D.) than among the non-hispanic whites (4.73+/-0.41%, P<0.01), but was similar in the two groups of girls (4.74+/-0.41 and 4.75+/-0.34, respectively, P=0.88). None of the students had abnormal glucose tolerance by the standards published for adults. CONCLUSIONS: A1C in boys was higher among minorities than among the non-hispanic whites, even at this young age of 11-13 years. This may be an early sign of predisposition to type 2 diabetes among the groups known to be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes. However, this difference was not seen among girls. Reasons for the discrepancy between boys and girls is unexplained. A school-based fingerstick screening program proved to be practical. As the risk of obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, increases among youth, the classroom may become an important location for screening.
