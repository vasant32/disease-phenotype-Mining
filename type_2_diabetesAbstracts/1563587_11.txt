To study whether abnormal secretion of islet amyloid polypeptide is involved in the development of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, we measured islet amyloid polypeptide concentrations in 56 first-degree relatives of Type 2 diabetic subjects and in 10 healthy control subjects. Fasting islet amyloid polypeptide concentrations were similar in control subjects, glucose-tolerant and glucose-intolerant relatives (8 +/- 1, 9 +/- 1 and 11 +/- 2 fmol/ml; p = NS). The area under the islet amyloid polypeptide curve measured during an oral glucose load was larger in glucose-intolerant relatives (115 +/- 13 fmol/ml) compared to glucose tolerant relatives and control subjects (88 +/- 3 and 79 +/- 12 fmol/ml; p less than 0.05). The insulin response during the oral glucose load was inversely correlated with the rate of glucose disposal measured during a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp (r = -0.725; p less than 0.01), while no significant correlation was observed between the corresponding values for islet amyloid polypeptide and glucose disposal (r = -0.380; p = NS). Hypersecretion of islet amyloid polypeptide is observed in glucose-intolerant first-degree relatives of patients with Type 2 diabetes. Since these patients are characterized by insulin resistance and abnormal first-phase insulin secretion, the putative role of islet amyloid polypeptide in the development of these abnormalities remains to be established. It is however, unlikely that islet amyloid polypeptide is involved in the development of insulin resistance as insulin-resistant relatives with normal glucose-tolerance showed normal islet amyloid polypeptide concentrations.
