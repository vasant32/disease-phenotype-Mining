 AIMS: To examine progression of glycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes cases participating in a quality improvement initiative. METHODS: 1108 new type 2 diabetes cases enrolled on the Otago Diabetes Register had clinical data recorded at baseline and 5 years. Means and standard deviations or percentages were calculated for variables of interest for <40, 40-59, 60-79 and 80-100 year age groups. p-Values for differences over time and among groups were calculated. Ordinal regression, with robust standard errors, was used to examine intensification of diabetes treatment. RESULTS: For all age groups blood pressure and lipid levels approached recommended targets at 5 years (p<0.001). Glycated haemoglobin worsened, especially in the youngest age group (from 7.3±1.9% to 7.9±1.7%, p<0.001) who had the highest odds of more intense diabetes treatment at 5 years: 6.2 (95% CI 3.5-11.2) compared with 3.3 (95% CI 2.7-4.1) for 40-59-year olds, 2.8 (95% CI 2.3-3.3) for 60-79-year olds and 1.4 (95% CI 0.9-2.0) for ≥80-year olds. CONCLUSIONS: Good management of type 2 diabetes patients, principally in primary care, can lead to improved blood pressure and lipid levels. Targets for glycaemic control and weight are less readily achieved especially among young age groups.
