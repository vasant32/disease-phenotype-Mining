AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) is the key enzyme involved in the regulation of gluconeogenesis. The aim of this study was to identify genetic polymorphisms in potential candidate genes for type 2 diabetes by sequencing all exons in the PCK genes (PCK1 and PCK2), and examining the association with type 2 diabetes and diabetic phenotypes in a Korean population (775 type 2 diabetic patients and 316 normal control subjects). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two polymorphisms in PCK1 and PCK2 were identified in a Korean population (n=24) by direct DNA sequencing. The TaqMan genotyping method was applied for genotyping the remainder of the study population. Associations of PCK polymorphisms with the risk of type 2 diabetes and diabetic phenotypes were analysed using logistic and multiple regressions, adjusting for age, sex and BMI. RESULTS: Although no significant associations between the genetic polymorphisms in PCK genes and the risk of type 2 diabetes were detected, in further haplotype analysis, one of the common haplotypes, PCK1 ht3, revealed susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (p=0.006). One 3' untranslated region (UTR) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) also showed an association with HDL levels among non-diabetic control subjects: individuals homozygous for the major allele (T/T) had the lowest HDL level (1.11+/-0.32 mmol/l), heterozygotes (T/C) had an intermediate level (1.27+/-0.37 mmol/l), and those homozygous for the minor allele (C/C) had the highest level (1.39+/-0.28 mmol/l) (p=0.000003). This 3' UTR SNP was also associated with triglyceride levels, with a lower triglyceride level observed among individuals who were homozygous for the minor allele (C/C) than among those who were not. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The strong genetic association of HDL and triglyceride levels with variation/haplotype information identified in this study would be useful for further genetic epidemiological studies of this important gene.
