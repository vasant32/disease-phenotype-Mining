 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Evidence has suggested that low serum potassium concentrations decrease insulin secretion, leading to glucose intolerance, and that hypokalaemia induced by diuretics increases the risk for diabetes in hypertensive individuals. However, no prospective study has investigated the association between serum potassium and the development of type 2 diabetes in a healthy cohort comprised of Asian individuals not being administered antihypertensive medications. This study aimed to investigate whether low serum potassium is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in apparently healthy Japanese men. METHODS: We followed 4,409 Japanese men with no history of diabetes, use of antihypertensives, renal dysfunction or liver dysfunction (mean ± SD age, 48.4 ± 8.4 years). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate HRs for incident diabetes (fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/l, HbA(1c) ≥ 6.5% or self-reported) including serum potassium concentration as either a categorical or a continuous variable. RESULTS: During a 5 year follow-up, 250 individuals developed type 2 diabetes. The lowest tertile of serum potassium (2.8-3.9 mmol/l) was independently associated with the development of diabetes after adjustment for known predictors (HR 1.57 [95% CI, 1.15-2.15]) compared with the highest tertile (4.2-5.4 mmol/l). Every 0.5 mmol/l lower increment in the baseline serum potassium level was associated with a 45% (12-87%) increased risk of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Mild to moderately low serum potassium levels, within the normal range and without frank hypokalaemia, could be predictive of type 2 diabetes in apparently healthy Japanese men.
