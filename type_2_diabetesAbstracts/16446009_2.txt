We previously reported that lipoprotein lipase mass level in preheparin serum (preheparin LPL mass) was significantly lower in type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to healthy subjects and increased by conventional insulin therapy using NPH (intermediate-acting) insulin. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intensive insulin therapy on preheparin LPL mass. Thirty-two subjects (total group) with type 2 diabetes receiving treatment by NPH insulin injection twice a day in the morning and evening were switched to basal bolus insulin (BBI) therapy (fast-acting insulin after each meal and NPH insulin before bedtime). In 14 subjects, the total daily insulin dose was not change after switching to BBI therapy (iso-dose group). After 3 months of BBI therapy, preheparin LPL mass increased significantly from 47 to 56 ng/ml in total group. Glycosylated hemoglobin and serum triglyceride levels decreased significantly, and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol increased significantly. Low-density lipoprotein levels did not changed but increase in size was suggested by PAG disc electrophoresis. Similar changes were observed in the iso-dose group. These results suggest that BBI therapy enhances preheparin LPL mass, accompanied by antiatherogenic changes in glucose and lipid metabolism.
