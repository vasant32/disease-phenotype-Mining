 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate early change of endothelial function by color Doppler ultrasound and pulse wave velocity in hyperglycemia people, and probe the effect of related factors. METHODS: From March to December 2009, 115 subjects (40 subjects with type 2 diabetes, 45 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance and 30 healthy individuals) aged 35-45 without cardio-cerebral-vascular disease and other disease were recruited into the study. Height, weight, blood pressure were measured, and fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, adiponectin, endothelin and lipid profile were tested. Then, pulse wave velocity and color Doppler ultrasound test was processed in all subjects. RESULTS: The abnormality of pulse wave velocity and endothelium-dependent dilatation was found both in impaired glucose tolerance stage and early stage of type 2 diabetes. Systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, endothelin, fasting blood glucose and postprandial blood glucose were positively correlated with pulse wave velocity and endothelium-dependent dilatation. Whereas, adiponetin was negatively correlated with pulse wave velocity and endothelium-dependent dilatation. CONCLUSION: Endothelial dysfunction exits in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance as well as in type 2 diabetes. Pulse wave velocity and endothelium-dependent dilatation are associated with adiponectin and endothelin.
