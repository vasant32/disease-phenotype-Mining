High-density lipoprotein (HDL) plays an important protective role against atherosclerosis, and the anti-atherogenic properties of HDL include the promotion of cellular cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant effects. RCT is a complex pathway, which transports cholesterol from peripheral cells and tissues to the liver for its metabolism and biliary excretion. The major steps in the RCT pathway include the efflux of free cholesterol mediated by cholesterol transporters from cells to the main extracellular acceptor HDL, the conversion of free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters and the subsequent removal of cholesteryl ester in HDL by the liver. The efficiency of RCT is influenced by the mobilization of cellular lipids for efflux and the intravascular remodelling and kinetics of HDL metabolism. Despite the increased cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes, current knowledge on RCT in diabetes is limited. In this article, abnormalities in RCT in type 2 diabetes mellitus and therapeutic strategies targeting HDL and RCT will be reviewed.
