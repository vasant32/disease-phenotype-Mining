India is facing an epidemic of type 2 diabetes, with high prevalence in urban areas. Urbanisation and associated life style changes adversely affect the risk factors for diabetes unmasking the high genetic tendency existing in the population. Various epidemiological studies in Indians have shown that the increasing prevalence of diabetes could be attributed to a high genetic risk and lower risk thresholds for acquired risk factors such as age, obesity, abdominal adiposity and a high percentage of body fat. Diabetes occurs at a younger age in Indians compared to Whites. The risk of diabetes increases with a body mass index (BMI) of >23 kg/m(2) and waist circumference of 85 cm for men and 80 cm for women in Asian Indians. For a given BMI, Asian Indians have higher central adiposity. There is also evidence of higher insulin resistance amongst Indians, and this is partly explained by higher body fat percentage. A large proportion of urban adults has the metabolic syndrome also which predisposes them to both diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Recognition of these conditions and institution of early preventive measures are urgently needed.
