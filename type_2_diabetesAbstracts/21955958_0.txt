 AIMS: Compare metabolic responses after mixed versus liquid meals of similar caloric/nutritional content in healthy and type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects. METHODS: Ten healthy men and 10 men with T2D received mixed and liquid meals after an overnight fast. Classical (insulinogenic index; insulin/glucose areas under curves, AUC(insulin)/AUC(glucose)) and model-based (beta-cell glucose sensitivity; rate sensitivity; potentiation factor ratio, PFR) beta-cell function estimates were calculated. Between-meal differences in glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglyceride (TG), beta-cell function and oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) and between-meal correlations for beta-cell function and OGIS were evaluated. RESULTS: Among healthy subjects, beta-cell function and OGIS were similar between meals. C-peptide (p=0.03), insulin (p=0.002), AUC(insulin)/AUC(glucose) (p=0.004) and insulin secretion (p=0.04) were higher after the liquid meal. Among T2D subjects, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, beta-cell function, and OGIS were similar. PFR was higher (p=0.004) and TG increased more slowly (p=0.002) after the liquid meal. OGIS and beta-cell function were correlated during both meals in both groups (r=0.66-0.98), except incremental AUC(insulin)/AUC(glucose), rate sensitivity, and, in healthy subjects, PFR. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic responses after mixed or liquid meals of similar content were highly correlated in T2D and healthy subjects. In T2D, the liquid meal produced beta-cell function estimates generally similar to the mixed meal.
