Preclinical studies suggest that incretin-based therapies may be beneficial for the bone; however, clinical data are largely lacking. We assessed whether the differential effects of these therapies on body weight differed with respect to their effect on bone mineral density (BMD) and markers of calcium homeostasis in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Sixty-nine metformin-treated patients with T2D were randomized to exenatide twice daily (n = 36) or insulin glargine once daily (n = 33). Total body BMD, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and serum markers of calcium homeostasis were assessed before and after 44-week treatment. Exenatide or insulin glargine treatment decreased body weight by 6%. Endpoint BMD was similar in both groups after 44-week therapy (LSmean ± s.e.m. between-group difference -0.002 ± 0.007 g/cm(2) ; p = 0.782). Fasting serum alkaline phosphatase, calcium and phosphate remained unaffected. Forty-four-week treatment with exenatide or insulin glargine had no adverse effects on bone density in patients with T2D, despite differential effects on body weight.
