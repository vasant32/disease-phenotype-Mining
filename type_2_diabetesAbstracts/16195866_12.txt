AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Proinsulin C-peptide is involved in several biological activities. However, the role of C-peptide in vascular smooth muscle cells is unclear. We therefore investigated its effects, in vascular smooth muscle cells in high-glucose conditions. METHODS: Rat aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured with 5.5 or 20 mmol/l glucose with or without C-peptide (1 to 100 nmol/l) for 3 weeks. Proliferation activities, the protein expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-beta receptor, the phosphorylation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and glucose uptake were measured. RESULTS: The proliferation activities increased approximately three-fold under high-glucose conditions (p<0.05). C-peptide suppressed hyperproliferation activities that were induced by high glucose. This happened in a dose-dependent manner from 1 to 100 nmol/l of C-peptide. C-peptide (10 and 100 nmol/l) inhibited the increased protein expression of PDGF-beta receptor and the phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAP kinases that had been induced by high glucose (p<0.05). Furthermore, 100 nmol/l of C-peptide augmented the impaired glucose uptake in the high-glucose conditions. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These observations suggest that C-peptide could prevent diabetic macroangiopathy by inhibiting smooth muscle cell growth and ameliorating glucose utilisation in smooth muscle cells. C-peptide may thus be a novel agent for treating diabetic macroangiopathy in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
