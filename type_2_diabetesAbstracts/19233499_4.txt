 AIMS: Type 2 diabetes in humans is associated with hypercoaguability; however, little is known about platelet function in mouse models of type 2 diabetes used to study this disorder. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine platelet aggregation, coagulation, and markers of platelet activation in a diet-induced mouse model of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Four week old, male, C57BL/6J mice were randomized to a standard chow or high fat (60% beef lard) diet for 4 months. To examine platelet function we measured ADP-induced whole blood aggregometry, whole blood coagulation by thromboelastography, tail bleeding times, platelet microparticle and platelet expression of p-selectin and platelet expression of CD61 by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Diabetic mice exhibited less aggregation (p<0.05), less coagulation (p<0.01), prolonged tail bleeding times (n.s.), and lower agonist stimulated platelet CD61 expression (p<0.001) compared to non-diabetic mice. There was no difference in platelet microparticle and platelet p-selectin expression. CONCLUSIONS: Diet-induced type 2 diabetic mouse do not demonstrate the hypercoagulability and platelet activation typically observed in humans with this disorder. More studies are warranted to further explore platelet function in this mouse model; to determine their applicability for studying these alterations in type 2 diabetes.
