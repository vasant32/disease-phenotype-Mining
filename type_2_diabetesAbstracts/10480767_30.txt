OBJECTIVE: Humalog Mix25 is a manufactured premixed insulin formulation containing insulin lispro and a novel insulin lispro-protamine formulation (NPL) in a ratio of 25:75%. The objective of this study was to compare Humalog Mix25 to human insulin 30/70 (30% regular insulin/70% NPH) with respect to glycemic control. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Humalog Mix25 was compared with human insulin 30/70 in 89 individuals with type 2 diabetes during a 6-month randomized open-label two-period crossover study. Each insulin was administered twice daily, before the morning and evening meals. Information regarding self-monitored blood glucose (BG), hypoglycemic episodes (hypoglycemic signs or symptoms or BG < or = 3.0 mmol/l), insulin dose, and HbA1c was collected. RESULTS: Treatment with Humalog Mix25 resulted in better postprandial glycemic control after the morning and evening meals compared with treatment with human insulin 30/70. Overall glycemic control and the incidence of hypoglycemia were comparable between the treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to treatment with human insulin 30/70, twice daily administration of Humalog Mix25 resulted in improved postprandial glycemic control, similar overall glycemic control, and the convenience of dosing immediately before meals.
