Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes is associated with the deposition of islet amyloid. The major formative peptide, islet amyloid polypeptide, has recently been characterised and an abnormality of the structure or expression of this gene is a possible candidate for the inherited component of Type 2 diabetes. A restriction fragment length polymorphism of the gene has been identified with Pvu II. To study the relationship between the islet amyloid polypeptide gene and Type 2 diabetes, two distinct genetic approaches have been undertaken. Firstly, non-linkage has been demonstrated in four pedigrees, with four normoglycaemic first degree relatives having an allele associated with diabetes in other family members, and one affected relative not having the putatively associated allele. The LOD score taking age-related penetrance into account was -1.68, making linkage unlikely (p = 0.02). Secondly, in a population-based restriction fragment length polymorphism survey, no linkage disequilibrium of the alleles was found between a population of unrelated Caucasian subjects with Type 2 diabetes and a normal population. A mutation in or near the islet amyloid polypeptide gene is thus unlikely to be a common cause of Type 2 diabetes.
