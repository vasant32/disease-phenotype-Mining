 OBJECTIVE: Hypertension in diabetes is characterized by abnormal sodium homeostasis, suggesting a particular role of natriuretic peptide pathway. Natriuretic peptides can affect blood pressure (BP) through their plasma concentrations, which are dependent on their receptor activities. We thus assessed the association between nine NPR3 gene polymorphisms and BP levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the haplotype structure of the NPR3 gene were genotyped in the 3,126 French Non-insulin-dependent Diabetes, Hypertension, Microalbuminuria or Proteinuria, Cardiovascular Events, and Ramipril (DIABHYCAR) trial participants. We then used a second population (Diabete de type 2, Nephropathie et Genetique [DIAB2NEPHROGENE]/Survie, Diabete de type 2 et Genetique [SURDIAGENE] study) of 2,452 patients for the purpose of replication. Finally, we separately investigated subjects selected according to their rs 2270915SNP genotypes for their BP response to salt restriction. RESULTS: In DIABHYCAR patients, three SNPs (rs6889608, rs1173773, and rs2270915) were significantly associated with systolic BP (SBP). The effect of the rs2270915 was replicated in the second step population: AA homozygotes had a lower SBP than G carriers (137.4 ± 19.1 vs. 140.0 ± 20.2 mmHg, P = 0.004). The rs2270915 influenced the response of SBP to salt reduction, with AA homozygous patients showing greater reductions after restriction of salt intake compared with G carriers: -20 mmHg (-43 to -8) vs. -3 (-20 to +7); P = 0.006. CONCLUSIONS: We found a consistent and significant association between the rs2270915 polymorphism of the NPR3 gene and SBP in diabetic patients. This genetic variation may affect pressure response to changes in dietary sodium.
