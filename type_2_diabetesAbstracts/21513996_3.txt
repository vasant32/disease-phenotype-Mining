 AIM: Iron may contribute to the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The aim of this study was to determine iron regulator hepcidin and iron metabolic parameters in Type 2 DM patients, the relationships among them were evaluated in this specific sub-groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included sixty-four people: 34 cases of diabetes and 30 age-matched controls. Serum hepcidin, IL-6, hsCRP, ferritin, sTfR, EPO as well as other clinical parameters were detected, and the associations between hepcidin levels and iron/inflammatory parameters were analyzed in diabetes and the controls. RESULTS: Serum ferritin and hepcidin levels in diabetic patients were significant higher than the controls (p<0.001 respectively). A positive correlation between hepcidin and ferritin, as well as between ferritin and IL-6 levels was existed in diabetes and the control groups (p<0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: All of these data demonstrated that the higher hepcidin levels in diabetic patients may be due to those higher ferritin and IL-6 levels, the elevated hepcidin might have adaptive value through down-regulated iron absorb and play an important role in pathogenesis of Type 2 DM.
