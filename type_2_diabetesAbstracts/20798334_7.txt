 OBJECTIVE: Cerebral microvascular disease associated with type 2 diabetes may exacerbate the effects of aging on cognitive function. A considerable homology exists between the retinal and cerebral microcirculations; a hypothesized association between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and cognitive decline was examined in older people with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the population-based Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study, 1,046 men and women aged 60-75 years with type 2 diabetes underwent standard seven-field binocular digital retinal photography and a battery of seven cognitive function tests. A general cognitive ability score (g) was generated by principal components analysis. The Mill-Hill Vocabulary Scale was used to estimate premorbid cognitive ability. DR was graded using a modification of the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Scale. RESULTS: After age and sex adjustment, a significant relationship was observed with increasing severity of DR (none, mild, and moderate to severe) for most cognitive measures. Participants with moderate-to-severe retinopathy had the worst g and the worst performances on the individual tests. There was a significant interaction between sex and retinopathy for g. In male subjects, the associations of retinopathy with g (and with tests of verbal fluency, mental flexibility, and processing speed but not memory and nonverbal reasoning) persisted (P < 0.05) when further adjusted for vocabulary (to estimate lifetime cognitive decline), depression, sociodemographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, and macrovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: DR was independently associated with estimated lifetime cognitive decline in older men with type 2 diabetes, supporting the hypothesis that cerebral microvascular disease may contribute to their observed accelerated age-related cognitive decline. A sex interaction with stronger findings in men requires further confirmation.
