To evaluate the role of the Ala45Thr variant of BETA2/NEUROD1 in the development of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, we studied a Japanese population consisting of 383 control subjects, 234 type 1 diabetes patients and 160 type 2 diabetes patients. Both genotypewise and allelewise, there was no significant association of the variant with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes in Japanese. Also, there were no significant differences in clinical characteristics with and without the variant. Our present results do not support a recent report which described an association of the Ala45Thr variant with type 1 diabetes in Japanese.
