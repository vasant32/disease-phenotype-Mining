OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the short-term impact of a 7-h type 2 diabetes continuing medical education (CME) program. Outcomes included a measure of health care providers' diabetes knowledge and the Diabetes Attitude Scale (DAS), a validated measure of attitudes toward diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A CME program on type 2 diabetes was presented by an expert panel in Chicago during November 1998. A before-after trial with pre- and postintervention measurements of diabetes knowledge and attitudes toward diabetes was administered as part of the program. A convenience sample of the 129 health care providers in attendance resulted in 91 (71%) completed pre- and postintervention surveys. RESULTS: Within-subjects analysis revealed increases in knowledge and more favorable attitudes toward diabetes after the program. Between-subjects analysis revealed that attitude changes differed for physicians as compared with allied health care providers. CONCLUSIONS: A CME program was associated with an increase in knowledge of diabetes and more favorable attitudes toward diabetes as measured by the DAS. The DAS changes were subtly different for the physician group as compared with the allied health care provider group. These results suggest that the DAS can be a useful instrument for measuring the short-term impact of educational interventions.
