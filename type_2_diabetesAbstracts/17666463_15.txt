 OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in telomere (terminal restriction fragment [TRF]) length and pulse wave velocity (PWV)--an index of arterial stiffness--in patients with type 2 diabetes with and without microalbuminuria (MA). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 84 men with type 2 diabetes, 40 with MA and 44 without MA (aged 63.5 +/- 9.0 vs. 61.2 +/- 9.8 years), were studied. TRF length was determined in white blood cells. MA was defined as albumin excretion rate (AER) in the range of 30-300 mg/24 h in at least two of three 24-h urine collections. PWV was assessed using applanation tonometry. Markers of oxidative stress were also measured. RESULTS: TRF length was shorter in patients with MA than in those without MA (6.64 +/- 0.74 vs. 7.23 +/- 1.01 kb, respectively, P = 0.004). PWV was significantly higher in the patients with MA. Multivariate linear regression analysis in the total sample demonstrated an independent association between TRF length and age (P = 0.02), MA status (P = 0.04) or AER (P = 0.002), and plasma nitrotyrosine levels (P = 0.02). AER was associated significantly with PWV (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with type 2 diabetes and MA have shorter TRF length and increased arterial stiffness than those without MA. Additionally, TRF length is associated with age, AER, and nitrosative stress. As shorter TRF length indicates older biological age, the increased arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes who have MA may be due to the more pronounced "aging " of these subjects.
