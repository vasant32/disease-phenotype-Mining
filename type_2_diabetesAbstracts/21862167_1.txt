Proteasome modulator 9 (PSMD9) is linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D). The author studied whether PSMD9 IVS3 + nt460 A > G, IVS3 + nt437 T > C and E197 are linked to carpal tunnel syndrome in T2D Italian families. Non-parametric linkage, linkage disequilibrium-based and independent SNPs-based linkage analyses were performed. The PSMD9 SNPs show linkage to carpal tunnel syndrome.
