Several lines of evidence indicate a causal role of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 in the development of type 2 diabetes in humans. Two common polymorphisms in the promoter of the IL-6 encoding gene IL6, -174G>C (rs1800795) and -573G>C (rs1800796), have been investigated for association with type 2 diabetes in numerous studies but with results that have been largely equivocal. To clarify the relationship between the two IL6 variants and type 2 diabetes, we analyzed individual data on >20,000 participants from 21 published and unpublished studies. Collected data represent eight different countries, making this the largest association analysis for type 2 diabetes reported to date. The GC and CC genotypes of IL6 -174G>C were associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 0.91, P = 0.037), corresponding to a risk modification of nearly 9%. No evidence for association was found between IL6 -573G>C and type 2 diabetes. The observed association of the IL6 -174 C-allele with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes provides further evidence for the hypothesis that immune mediators are causally related to type 2 diabetes; however, because the association is borderline significant, additional data are still needed to confirm this finding.
