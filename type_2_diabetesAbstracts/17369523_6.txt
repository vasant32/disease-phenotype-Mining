Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 11 (ARHGEF11), located on chromosome 1q21, is involved in G protein signaling and is a pathway known to play a role in both insulin secretion and action. We genotyped 52 single nucleotide polymorphims (SNPs) in ARHGEF11 and compared the genotype frequencies of subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 145) or type 2 diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (n = 293) with those of control subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (n = 358). Thirty SNPs, spanning the entire gene, were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes or type 2 diabetes/IGT. The most significantly associated SNP was rs6427340 (intron 2), in which the less common allele was the risk allele (odds ratio [OR] 1.82 [95% CI 1.20-2.70], P = 0.005 for type 2 diabetes vs. NGT and 1.79 [1.27-2.50], P = 0.0008 for type 2 diabetes/IGT vs. NGT). In an expanded set of nondiabetic subjects (n = 754), most of the type 2 diabetes-and IGT-associated SNPs were significantly associated with glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test, with the same SNP (rs6427340) showing the most significant associations (P = 0.007). All type 2 diabetes-and IGT-associated SNPs were in high linkage disequilibrium and constitute a single 133-kb haplotype block. These results, coupled with similar findings in Pima Indians, suggest that sequence variation in ARHGEF11 may influence risk of type 2 diabetes.
