 AIM: To examine the effects of glibenclamide and repaglinide on glucose stimulated insulin release, incretins, oxidative stress and cell adhesion molecules in patients with type 2 diabetes suboptimally treated with metformin. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was performed recruiting 27 subjects (HbA(1c) between 7.5 and 10.5%) free from cardiovascular and renal disease. Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), total antioxidant status, F(2)-isoprostane, interleukin-6 and cell adhesion molecules were measured during an oral glucose load at baseline and after eight weeks of treatment. The areas under the curve were analysed at 45, 60 and 120 min (AUC(45), AUC(60), AUC(120)). RESULTS: Significant improvements in glucose were observed with repaglinide (HBA(1c): -1.5%, fasting glucose: -2.8 mmol/L, 2-h glucose: -3.7 mmol/L, AUC(120): -18.9%) and glibenclamide (-1.0%, -2.2 mmol/L, -2.5 mmol/L, -17.5%). Repaglinide was also associated with an increase in the AUC(60) and AUC(120) for insulin (+56%, +61%) and C-peptide (+41%, +36%). GLP-1, GIP, IL-6, ICAM-1 and E-selectin levels did not change in either group. No association was observed between GLP-1, GIP-1 and plasma markers of oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: Repaglinide is associated with improved postprandial glycaemic control via insulin and C-peptide release. We observed no direct effects of glibenclamide or repaglinide on plasma levels of GLP-1 or GIP. We observed no associations of GLP-1 and GIP with plasma markers of oxidative stress.
