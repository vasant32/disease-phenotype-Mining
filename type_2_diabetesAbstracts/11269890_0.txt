Insulin resistance is known as an important risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, CAD-related mortality in Japanese type 2 diabetics is lower than in Caucasians. To investigate whether insulin resistance is related to CAD in Japanese type 2 diabetics, we measured insulin sensitivity and several coronary risk factors in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes with and without CAD. Thirty-three patients with definite CAD and 33 age- and sex-matched patients without CAD (control) were studied. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by the K index of insulin tolerance test (KITT). Clinical characteristics, classical risk factors, lipoprotein (a), and insulin sensitivity were compared between the two groups. Patients with CAD had a significantly longer duration of diabetes (9.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.9 years, P < 0.05, respectively), were mostly hypertensive (69.7 vs. 39.4%, P < 0.05), and more likely to be treated with insulin (45.5 vs. 18.2%, P < 0.05) compared with the control. Concerning the metabolic parameters, patients with CAD had a significantly higher insulin resistance than control (2.40 +/- 0.15 vs. 3.23 +/- 0.17%/min, P < 0.01, respectively), higher triglyceride (1.39 +/- 0.10 vs. 1.05 +/- 0.05 mmol/l, P < 0.05), lower HDL cholesterol (1.05 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.28 +/- 0.06 mmol/l, P < 0.05), and higher lipoprotein (a) (27.5 +/- 4.3 vs. 17.4 +/- 2.0 mg/dl, P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that hypertension, insulin resistance, high lipoprotein (a) and triglyceride, and low HDL cholesterol were independently related to CAD. Our results suggest that insulin resistance per se is a significant risk factor for CAD in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
