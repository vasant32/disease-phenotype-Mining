 OBJECTIVE: Diabetes negatively impacts the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with type 2 diabetes. An earlier analysis showed HRQOL to be associated with mortality, which suggests that measuring HRQOL could have clinical implications. We studied the association between HRQOL and total and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes during long-term follow-up and specifically focused on old age and sex differences. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: HRQOL was measured in a prospectively followed cohort of 1,353 patients with type 2 diabetes using the RAND-36. Cox proportional hazard models were used to measure the independent effect of baseline HRQOL on mortality. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 9.6 years, 570 (42%) patients died, 280 of whom died of cardiovascular disease (49%). The Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (MCS) were inversely associated with total mortality, with hazard ratios of 0.988 (95% CI 0.983-0.993) and 0.990 (95% CI 0.985-0.995), respectively. A 10-point-higher score on the PCS and MCS decreased the risk for total mortality by 11 and 10%, respectively. An inverse relationship with mortality was also seen for men, women, and for patients aged>75 years. Mental health was significantly related to mortality in men but not in women. CONCLUSIONS: Lower physical and mental HRQOL was associated with a higher total mortality and cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes; this is also the case when studying men and women and the elderly separately. The dimension mental health, related to depression and anxiety, was only associated with mortality in men, not in women.
