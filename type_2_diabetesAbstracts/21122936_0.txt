 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of serum visfatin, adiponectin and leptin with 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the context of the role of obesity or insulin resistance, which is not well understood. METHODS: A total of 76 newly-diagnosed T2DM patients and 76 healthy control subjects, matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and sex ratio, were enrolled. Anthropometric parameters, glycemic and lipid profile, insulin resistance (measured by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index [HOMA-IR]), leptin, adiponectin, and visfatin were assessed. RESULTS: On the contrary to adiponectin, serum leptin and visfatin levels were higher in T2DM patients compared with controls (10.07 ± 4.5, 15.87 ± 16.4, and 5.49 ± 2.4 vs. 12.22 ± 4.9 μg/ml, 8.5 ± 7.8 ng/ml and 3.58 ± 2.2 ng/ml, respectively, P<0.01). Waist circumference and BMI were correlated with leptin and adiponectin but not with visfatin. Leptin, adiponectin and visfatin all were associated with T2DM following adjusting for obesity measures. After controlling for HOMA-IR, visfatin remained as an independent predictor of T2DM (odds ratio=1.32, P<0.05). In a multiple regression analysis to determine visfatin only triglycerides and fasting glucose remained in the model (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Elevation of visfatin in T2DM is independent of obesity and insulin resistance and is mainly determined by fasting glucose and triglycerides.
