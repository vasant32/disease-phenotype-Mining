 OBJECTIVE: Chronic renal insufficiency and/or proteinuria in type 2 diabetes may stem from chronic renal diseases (CKD) other than classic diabetic nephropathy in more than one-third of patients. We interrogated urine proteomic profiles generated by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry with the aim of isolating a set of biomarkers able to reliably identify biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy and to establish a stringent correlation with the different patterns of renal injury. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten micrograms of urine proteins from 190 subjects (20 healthy subjects, 20 normoalbuminuric, and 18 microalbuminuric diabetic patients and 132 patients with biopsy-proven nephropathy: 65 diabetic nephropathy, 10 diabetic with nondiabetic CKD [nd-CKD], and 57 nondiabetic with CKD) were run using a CM10 ProteinChip array and analyzed by supervised learning methods (Classification and Regression Tree analysis). RESULTS: The classification model correctly identified 75% of patients with normoalbuminuria, 87.5% of those with microalbuminuria, and 87.5% of those with diabetic nephropathy when applied to a blinded testing set. Most importantly, it was able to reliably differentiate diabetic nephropathy from nd-CKD in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Among the best predictors of the classification model, we identified and validated two proteins, ubiquitin and Î²2-microglobulin. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest the presence of a specific urine proteomic signature able to reliably identify type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis.
