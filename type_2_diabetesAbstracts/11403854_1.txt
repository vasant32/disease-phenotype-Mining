By using a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding sequence, the chromosomal location of Tcf2, encoding hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-1beta, was determined in F2 intercrosses between Nagoya-Shibata-Yasuda (NSY) mice, an animal model of type 2 diabetes, and control C3H/He mice. The promoter region of Tcf2 gene was sequenced in NSY, non-obese diabetic (NOD) and control C3H/He mice. Tcf2 was mapped between genetic markers D11MIT320 and D11MIT195 with the following distances: D11MIT320-(7.3 cM)-Tcf2-(0.5 cM)-D11MIT195. A variant with insertion of C between -205 and -204 in the promoter region of Tcf2 was identified in NSY mice, but not NOD and C3H/He mice.
