Vascular reactivity to nitric oxide (NO) is mediated by NO-sensitive soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Since a diminished activity of vascular sGC has been reported in an animal model of type 2 diabetes, the sGC activity was assayed in vitro in internal mammary artery specimens obtained during bypass surgery from patients with and without type 2 diabetes. The sensitivity of sGC to NO, which is dependent on Fe(2+)-containing heme, was measured in vitro using stimulation with diethylamine NONOate (DEA/NO). In addition, the novel cyclic guanosine monophosphate-elevating compound HMR-1766 was used to test the stimulation of the oxidized heme-Fe(3+)-containing form of sGC. Basal activity of sGC and its sensitivity to stimulation by DEA/NO and HMR-1766 were not different between control and type 2 diabetic patients: maximum stimulation by DEA/NO amounted to 475 +/- 67 and 418 +/- 59 pmol. mg(-1). min(-1) in control and type 2 diabetic patients, respectively. The maximum effects of HMR-1766 were 95 +/- 18 (control subjects) and 83 +/- 11 pmol. mg(-1). min(-1) (type 2 diabetic patients). Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, drug treatment with statins, ACE inhibitors, or nitrates had no effect on sGC activity. In conclusion, the present findings do not support the hypothesis that desensitization of sGC contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular dysfunction in humans.
