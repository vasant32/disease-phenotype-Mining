 OBJECTIVE: To report the 2001 prevalence and 2002-2005 incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in Hispanic American youth and to describe the demographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics of these youth. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study, a population-based multicenter observational study of youth aged 0-19 years with physician-diagnosed diabetes, were used to estimate the prevalence and incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Information obtained by questionnaire, physical examination, and blood and urine collection was analyzed to describe the characteristics of youth who completed a study visit. RESULTS: Among Hispanic American youth, type 1 diabetes was more prevalent than type 2 diabetes, including in youth aged 10-19 years. There were no significant sex differences in type 1 or type 2 diabetes prevalence. The incidence of type 2 diabetes for female subjects aged 10-14 years was twice that of male subjects (P < 0.005), while among youth aged 15-19 years the incidence of type 2 diabetes exceeded that of type 1 diabetes for female subjects (P < 0.05) but not for male subjects. Poor glycemic control, defined as A1C >or=9.5%, as well as high LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were common among youth aged >or=15 years with either type of diabetes. Forty-four percent of youth with type 1 diabetes were overweight or obese. CONCLUSIONS: Factors such as poor glycemic control, elevated lipids, and a high prevalence of overweight and obesity may put Hispanic youth with type 1 and type 2 diabetes at risk for future diabetes-related complications.
