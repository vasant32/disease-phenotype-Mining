This study examined the prevalence of retinopathy in 2131 patients with type 2 diabetes attending a Beijing hospital for the first time. The median age of patients was 58 years (IQR 50-65). The overall prevalence of retinopathy was 27.3% (95% CI: 25.4-29.2) and for proliferative retinopathy 7.8% (95% CI: 6.7-8.9). When all patients were considered together, duration of diabetes (OR=1.8; P=0.001) and albumin excretion rate (OR=1.5; P=0.019) were independent risk factors for retinopathy. Blue-collar occupation (OR=1.5; P=0.047) and blood pressure (OR=1.2; P=0.021) were additional risk factors for non-proliferative and proliferative retinopathy respectively. Amongst the 773 newly diagnosed patients, 21% (95% CI: 17.8-23.6) already had retinopathy. The median age of those patients with retinopathy at diagnosis of diabetes was 3 years higher that those without retinopathy, and blue-collar workers (OR=2.2; P=0.012) as well as female gender were particularly at risk (OR=2.0; P=0.033). There was a strong correlation between duration of diabetes with the presence of retinopathy (r=0.95; P=0.01). By extrapolation, it could be estimated that some degree of hyperglycaemia might have been present for more than 20 years before diabetes was diagnosed. These findings emphasise the importance of earlier diagnosis of diabetes and its complications, especially in socially disadvantaged groups.
