Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma is a major regulator of adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. The PPAR-gamma gene generates two isoforms through alternative splicing, PPAR-gamma1 and -gamma2, the latter having an additional stretch of 28 amino acids at its NH2-terminus in the ligand-independent activation domain. This extension renders PPAR-gamma2 more sensitive to insulin action. Since there is a Pro12Ala substitution in this domain, we tested whether it is related to type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance. Therefore, 131 type 2 diabetic patients and 312 normoglycemic control subjects were screened for the presence of the mutation and for major clinical and metabolic features. The frequency of the mutation did not differ significantly between diabetic patients and control subjects. BMI, insulin, and other metabolic and anthropometric variables were also not associated with the mutation. Although the study was carried out on a sufficiently large sample, the conclusions do not support a major role for the Pro12Ala substitution of the PPAR-gamma gene in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.
