In a community based survey of gestational diabetes in 18 rural villages of the eastern zone of Tigray administrative region, northern Ethiopia, a total of 890 pregnant women with gestational age of 24 weeks and above were examined for gestational diabetes mellitus based on WHO criteria. A 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test was performed on each subject with measurement of glucose at 0 and 2 h. Blood glucose was determined by glucose oxidase method using capillary blood (Accutrend alpha, Boehringer Mannheim). The mean age of the mothers was 27.4 +/- 7.1 years. Forty four percent of the subjects were multiparas. The prevalence rate of gestational diabetes mellitus was found to be 3.7% (95% CI 2.5-4.9). The mean blood glucose 2 h after glucose load in those pregnant diagnosed to have gestational diabetes mellitus was 154.6 +/- 14.4 mg/dl (J.W. Rich-Edwards, G.A. Colditz, M.J. Stampfer, W.C. Willett, M.W. Gillman, C. Hennekens, F.E. Speizer, J.E. Manson, Birth weight and the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult women, Annu. Intern. Med. 130 (1999) 278-284). The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus in this region of the country is high as compared to other parts of Africa. The possible role and contribution of exposure of the general population in this area to chronic malnutrition as a result of prolonged famine, drought and war, to the high prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus warrants further study.
