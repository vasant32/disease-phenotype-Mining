 OBJECTIVE: This open-label, active-controlled study investigated the cardiac safety and antihyperglycemic effect of rosiglitazone (RSG) in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Of the 203 patients randomly assigned to RSG (4 mg b.i.d.) or glyburide (GLB) (titrated to achieve optimal glycemic control for the first 8 weeks only to limit the risk of hypoglycemia; mean 10.5 mg/day), 118 had an echocardiogram performed at week 52. Left ventricular (LV) mass index, ejection fraction, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume were assessed by M-mode echocardiography at baseline and weeks 12, 28, and 52; 24-h ambulatory blood pressure was assessed at baseline and at weeks 28 and 52. Glycemic control was assessed by measuring fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA(1c). RESULTS: Neither treatment produced an increase in LV mass index that exceeded 1 SD. Ejection fraction did not change in either group. Both groups had clinically insignificant increases in LV end-diastolic volume. RSG, but not GLB, caused a statistically significant reduction in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure. Both treatments reduced HbA(1c) and FPG. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 52 weeks of therapy with RSG (4 mg b.i.d.) did not adversely affect cardiac structure or function in patients with type 2 diabetes and produced significant and sustained reductions in hyperglycemia. Decreases in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure with RSG were superior to those with GLB.
