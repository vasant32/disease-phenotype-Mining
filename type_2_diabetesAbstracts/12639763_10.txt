The effect of 6 months combined, continuous hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with conjugated equine oestrogen (0.625 mg) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg) on albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) was determined in postmenopausal diabetic women in a randomised, controlled study. Mean (interquartile range) change in plasma ACR was not (P=0.96) different in women receiving HRT [2 (-11, 21) mg/g, n=20] compared with those randomised to placebo [2 (-1, 14) mg/g, n=27]. Also, the proportion of women with microalbuminuria did not change (P=0.75) during HRT (baseline, 0.45; end of study, 0.53). Furthermore, several risk factors for microalbuminuria including systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and adiposity did not vary significantly during HRT. These data suggest that 6 months HRT does not reverse microalbuminuria caused by prolonged hyperglycaemia and other risk factors that underlie leakage of albumin into the urine in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes.
