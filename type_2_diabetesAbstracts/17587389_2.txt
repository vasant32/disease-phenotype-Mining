 BACKGROUND: Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and albuminuria are at risk for progressive diabetic nephropathy. The relative blood pressure lowering and antialbuminuric efficacy of angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB) vs. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor has not been well studied. METHODS: Forty-one ARB- and ACE inhibitor-naive T2DM subjects with albuminuria (>30 mg/g creatinine) were given either 50 mg of losartan (ARB) or 20 mg of quinapril (ACE inhibitor) (50% maximum dose) for 4 weeks, with a 4-week wash-out period in-between interventions in a crossover fashion. The order of intervention was randomized. The primary endpoint was the reduction of blood pressure and albuminuria. Secondary endpoint was changes in plasma transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). RESULTS: Among the 41 subjects, 66% were male. The mean age (s.d.) was 52 (10) years, and duration of diabetes was 8 (14) years. Blood pressure reduction (though not statistically significant) was similar on both interventions [systolic: losartan 3 (15) vs. quinapril 2 (13) mmHg, p = 0.52; diastolic: losartan 1 (9) vs. quinapril 2 (8) mmHg, p = 0.55]. However, amelioration of albuminuria [mean (s.e.)] was significantly greater with losartan [losartan vs. quinapril: -93 (82) vs. -49 (65) mg/g, p = 0.02]. There was no change in plasma TGF-beta levels [mean (s.d.)] on either treatment, losartan [before 12.1 (8.9) vs. after 11.9 (9.6) ng/ml, p = 0.68] and quinapril [11.1 (7.9) vs. 11.1 (7.8) ng/ml, p = 0.87). CONCLUSION: In Asian subjects with T2DM and albuminuria, 4 weeks of losartan therapy at 50 mg daily appeared to have greater antialbuminuric effect than 20 mg of quinapril.
