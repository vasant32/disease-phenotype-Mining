 OBJECTIVE: Glucose intolerance is recognized as a predictor of congestive heart failure (CHF). However, the association of postprandial hyperglycemia or fasting hyperglycemia with CHF has not been clarified. We determined the impact of the total spectrum of glucose abnormalities on left ventricular (LV) geometry and diastolic function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-seven Japanese subjects who visited the university hospital to be checked for glucose intolerance or known type 2 diabetes were consecutively recruited. Participants underwent an oral glucose tolerance test if they had no history of diabetes, and LV geometry and LV systolic and diastolic function were analyzed by Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: The frequency of LV diastolic dysfunction in subjects with normal glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), newly detected diabetes, and known diabetes were 13, 22, 50, 51, and 61%, respectively (Ï‡(2) = 54.2, P < 0.0001). IGT was a predictor for LV diastolic dysfunction after adjusting for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate (odds ratio 3.43 [95% CI 1.09-11.2]), but IFG was not (0.49 [0.06-3.08]). IGT was a predictor after adjusting for established CHF risk factors but was no longer significant after adjusting for BMI and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: In this hospital-based registry of subjects without CHF, the prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction was higher in subjects with IGT but not in those with IFG. Results suggest that IGT, as well as newly detected and known diabetes, could be linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular events, partly through LV diastolic dysfunction.
