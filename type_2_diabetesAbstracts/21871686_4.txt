 AIM: To assess efficacy and safety of saxagliptin added to metformin versus placebo plus metformin in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and inadequate glycemic control on metformin alone. METHODS: Adults (HbA(1c) 7.0-10.0%, on stable metformin ≥ 1500 mg/day) were randomized 1:1 to saxagliptin 5mg daily plus metformin (n = 283) or placebo plus metformin (n = 287). The primary end point was HbA(1c) change from baseline to Week 24. RESULTS: Saxagliptin plus metformin provided significant adjusted mean decreases versus placebo plus metformin (p ≤ 0.0052) in HbA(1c) (-0.78% versus -0.37%), fasting plasma glucose (-1.14 mmol/L versus -0.58 mmol/L), and postprandial glucose area under the curve from 0 to 180 min (-315 mmol min/L versus -160 mmol min/L). Significantly more saxagliptin-treated patients achieved a therapeutic glycemic response (HbA(1c)<7.0%) (46.5% versus 30.5%; p = 0.0001). The proportion of patients experiencing adverse events (excluding hypoglycemia) was similar for saxagliptin plus metformin (42.8%) versus placebo plus metformin (40.8%). Hypoglycemic events were reported in 1.4% of patients in each group. CONCLUSION: Saxagliptin added to metformin significantly improved glycemic control and was well tolerated in Asian patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control with metformin and diet and lifestyle modification.
