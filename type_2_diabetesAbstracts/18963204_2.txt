 AIMS: We have determined 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (HSD11B1) and Hexose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (H6PD) mRNA expression levels in adipose tissues from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Six non-diabetic and seven diabetic male patients who undergo elective abdominal surgery were included in the study and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were obtained. Fresh preadipocyte cultures were administered to low and high glucose medium (11M and 25M) in vitro for 24h and mRNA extractions were performed. HSD11B1 and H6PD gene mRNA expression levels were determined by real-time PCR and compared. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (G3PD) mRNA level is used as housekeeping gene expression. RESULTS: HSD11B1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in patient with T2DM than controls in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (3.35+/-0.7 vs. 0.37+/-0.1; P=0.01 and 2.07+/-0.8 vs. 0.11+/-0.05; P=0.01, respectively). H6PD mRNA levels were also significantly higher in patient with T2DM than controls in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (3.95+/-1.2 vs. 1.95+/-0.8; P=0.050 and 2.23+/-1.1 vs. 0.46+/-0.1; P=0.043, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Failure to down-regulate HSD11B1 activity in patients with type 2 diabetes may contribute to the pathogenesis of T2DM. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues similarly exhibit the same variation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
