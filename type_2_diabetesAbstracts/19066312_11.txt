 OBJECTIVE: Increased availability of fatty acids is important for accumulation of intracellular lipids and development of insulin resistance in human myotubes. It is unknown whether different types of fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or tetradecylthioacetic acid (TTA) influence these processes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined fatty acid and glucose metabolism and gene expression in cultured human skeletal muscle cells from control and type 2 diabetic individuals after 4 days of preincubation with EPA or TTA. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes myotubes exhibited reduced formation of CO(2) from palmitic acid (PA), whereas release of beta-oxidation products was unchanged at baseline but significantly increased with respect to control myotubes after preincubation with TTA and EPA. Preincubation with TTA enhanced both complete (CO2) and beta-oxidation of palmitic acid, whereas EPA increased only beta-oxidation significantly. EPA markedly enhanced triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in myotubes, more pronounced in type 2 diabetes cells. TAG accumulation and fatty acid oxidation were inversely correlated only after EPA preincubation, and total level of acyl-CoA was reduced. Glucose oxidation (CO2 formation) was enhanced and lactate production decreased after chronic exposure to EPA and TTA, whereas glucose uptake and storage were unchanged. EPA and especially TTA increased the expression of genes involved in fatty acid uptake, activation, accumulation, and oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 1) mitochondrial dysfunction in diabetic myotubes is caused by disturbances downstream of fatty acid beta-oxidation; 2) EPA promoted accumulation of TAG, enhanced beta-oxidation, and increased glucose oxidation; and 3) TTA improved complete palmitic acid oxidation in diabetic myotubes, opposed increased lipid accumulation, and increased glucose oxidation.
