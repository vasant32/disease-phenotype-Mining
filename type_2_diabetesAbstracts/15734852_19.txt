Catch-up growth, a risk factor for later obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, is characterized by hyperinsulinemia and an accelerated rate for recovering fat mass, i.e., catch-up fat. To identify potential mechanisms in the link between hyperinsulinemia and catch-up fat during catch-up growth, we studied the in vivo action of insulin on glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in a previously described rat model of weight recovery exhibiting catch-up fat caused by suppressed thermogenesis per se. To do this, we used euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps associated with the labeled 2-deoxy-glucose technique. After 1 week of isocaloric refeeding, when body fat, circulating free fatty acids, or intramyocellular lipids in refed animals had not yet exceeded those of controls, insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in refed animals was lower in skeletal muscles (by 20-43%) but higher in white adipose tissues (by two- to threefold). Furthermore, fatty acid synthase activity was higher in adipose tissues from refed animals than from fed controls. These results suggest that suppressed thermogenesis for the purpose of sparing glucose for catch-up fat, via the coordinated induction of skeletal muscle insulin resistance and adipose tissue insulin hyperresponsiveness, might be a central event in the link between catch-up growth, hyperinsulinemia and risks for later metabolic syndrome.
