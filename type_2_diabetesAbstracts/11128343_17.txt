 OBJECTIVE: Women with diabetes have urinary tract infections (UTIs) more often than women without diabetes. The aim of the present multicenter study was to evaluate which clinical characteristics are associated with the development of a symptomatic UTI during an 18-month follow-up period. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes who were between 18 and 75 years of age were included. Follow-up results were available for 589 of the 636 women included in this study. All patients were interviewed, their medical history was noted, and at least one uncontaminated urine culture was collected at the moment of study entry. RESULTS: Of the 589 women, 115 (20%) developed a symptomatic UTI, 96 (83%) of whom were prescribed antimicrobial therapy A total of 34 women (14%) with type 1 diabetes developed a UTI. The most important risk factor for these women was sexual intercourse during the week before entry into the study (44% without vs. 53% with sexual intercourse, relative risk [RR] = 3.0, P = 0.01). A total of 81 (23%) women with type 2 diabetes developed a UTI. The most important risk factor for these women was the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) at baseline (25% without vs. 42% with ASB, RR = 1.65, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for developing a UTI are the presence of ASB for women with type 2 diabetes and sexual intercourse during the week before entry into the study for women with type 1 diabetes.
