We aimed to establish the prevalence and characteristics of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and compare it with type 2 diabetes in 1370 Korean patients. The prevalence of LADA was 5.1%. Low C-peptide level and absence of metabolic syndrome were variables independently associated with the diagnosis of LADA.
