We evaluated the influence of posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide on blood glucose and blood pressure in type 2 diabetes patients. This treatment, in this limited series, did not significantly increase HbA1c levels or blood pressures. But spike-like increases of fasting blood glucose were observed in some cases.
