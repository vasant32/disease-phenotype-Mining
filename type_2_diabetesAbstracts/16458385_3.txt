We investigated the plasma levels of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and their relation with clinical and metabolic parameters in non-obese type 2 diabetic patients. The plasma levels of TAFI and PAI-1 were evaluated in 47 non-obese type 2 diabetic patients and 31 normal subjects. The intra-abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat areas were measured by computed tomography (CT). The degree of insulin resistance was evaluated by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique using artificial pancreas. The plasma levels of TAFI (169.0+/-108.8% versus 103.7+/-52.3%; p<0.001, mean+/-S.D.) and PAI-1 (82.7+/-54.5ng/ml versus 52.9+/-51.7ng/ml; p<0.05) were significantly higher in non-obese type 2 diabetic patients than in normal subjects. Univariate analysis showed that the plasma TAFI levels are significantly and inversely correlated with the glucose infusion rate (GIR) (r=-0.42, p<0.005) in all diabetic patients. Moreover, the plasma levels of TAFI were significantly correlated with fasting plasma glucose levels (r=0.47, p<0.001) and HbA(1c) (r=0.38, p<0.005) in all subjects. The plasma levels of PAI-1 were significantly and proportionally correlated with the visceral fat area (r=0.42, p<0.005) and body mass index (r=0.33, p<0.05). There was no significant correlation between plasma levels of TAFI and PAI-1 (r=0.04). These results show that the plasma levels of TAFI and PAI-1 differently correlate with insulin resistance and visceral fat accumulation, suggesting that different factors are implicated in the plasma elevation of TAFI and PAI-1 in non-obese type 2 diabetes mellitus.
