 OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate the association of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) with both arterial stiffness and intima-media thickness (IMT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 731 subjects with type 2 diabetes. DPN was diagnosed on the basis of neuropathic symptoms, insensitivity to a 10-g monofilament, abnormal pin-prick sensation, and abnormal current perception threshold. Arterial stiffness was assessed by cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), and IMT was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography. RESULTS: Patients with DPN had higher CAVI than those without DPN in multivariate-adjusted models, whereas no differences in IMT were observed between patients with and without DPN after adjustment for age and sex. In the multivariate analysis, CAVI was a significant determinant of DPN (odds ratio 1.36 [95% CI 1.13-1.65], P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DPN is significantly associated with arterial stiffness without carotid intimal changes in patients with type 2 diabetes.
