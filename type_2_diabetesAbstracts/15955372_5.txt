Type 2 diabetes is a disease characterised by peripheral insulin resistance, as well as by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. This process is in part due to elevated blood glucose and free fatty acids--termed glucolipotoxicity. The traditional pathway of treating type 2 diabetes in a stepwise manner, beginning with life style modifications and continuing with oral hypoglycaemic agents leads to a protracted period of unnecessary hyperglycaemia. A new approach, targeted at alleviating the deleterious effects of hyperglycaemia and elevated free fatty acids by acutely lowering both with intensive insulin therapy, has yielded prolonged remissions in therapy in which only diet was necessary to maintain normoglycaemia. This new approach, its rationale, benefits and misgivings are discussed in this review.
