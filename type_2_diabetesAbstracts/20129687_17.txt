 AIMS: To assay the levels of serum omentin-1 in subjects with different levels of glucose regulation and to analyze the relationship between serum omentin-1 levels and body mass index (BMI), glycoslated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. METHODS: Forty-six patients with impaired glucose regulation (IGR), 55 patients with newly diagnosed and untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 50 subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) were enrolled in this study. The levels of serum omentin-1 and plasma glucose at fasting and at 2h after glucose load and fasting serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, insulin, and HbA1c were measured. HOMA-IR was calculated. RESULTS: The levels of serum omentin-1 were lower in the IGR and T2DM groups than in the NGT group. Within groups, omentin-1 levels were no significant difference before and after glucose load. The level of serum omentin-1 was negatively correlated to BMI, HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, plasma glucose. HOMA-IR and BMI were independent related factors that influenced the levels of serum omentin-1. CONCLUSIONS: Serum omentin-1 levels were decreased in impaired glucose regulation subjects. Lack of omentin-1 may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and T2DM.
