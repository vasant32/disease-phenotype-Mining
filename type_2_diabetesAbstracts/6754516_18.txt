Hepatic glucose production and metabolic clearance rate of glucose were measured using (3-3H) glucose at steady state, basally and during two sequential 2 h insulin (25 and 40 mU . kg -1 . h -1)/glucose (2 and 3 mg. kg -1 . min -1) infusion periods. Eight diabetic subjects were studied before and after 1 week of twice daily insulin therapy; six control subjects matched for age, weight and degree of obesity were also studied. In the diabetic patients, pre-treatment hepatic glucose production was 20.0 +/- 2.2, 9.9 +/- 2.9, and 1.4 +/- 0.8 mu mol . kg -1 . min -1 respectively (+/- SEM) for each of the three periods, and fell significantly with treatment to 12.8 +/- 1.7, 4.0 +/- 1.5 and 1.9 +/- 1.0 mu mol . kg -1 . min -1. Hepatic glucose production in normal subjects was 13.2 +/- 0.6, 2.2 +/- 0.8 and less than 1 mu mol . kg -1 . min -1. The pre-treatment metabolic clearance rate in all diabetic studies with insulin levels greater than or equal to 30 mU/l was 1.10 +/- 0.14 ml . kg -1 . min -1 and remained virtually unchanged following insulin therapy; this was significantly lower than in the control subjects (6.83 +/- 1.02, p less than 0.001). Basal non-esterified fatty acid levels were higher (p less than 0.02) in the pre-treated diabetic patients compared to post-treated diabetic patients and control subjects. Non-esterified fatty acids in each group fell to similar levels during the insulin infusions, but the rate of fall was slower in the pre-treated diabetic patients. Insulin receptor binding to erythrocytes was normal in the diabetic subjects and unchanged by treatment. Therefore, following insulin treatment of uncontrolled Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes, the initially increased basal hepatic glucose production, and decreased hepatic sensitivity, return towards normal. However, the glucose clearance remains low, despite good diabetic control, and appears to be a major factor in the continuing glucose intolerance. As insulin receptor binding is normal, the defect of glucose clearance in Type 2 diabetes appears compatible with a post-receptor defect of glucose metabolism.
