 OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between acculturation modes (integrated, assimilated, traditional, and marginalized) and type 2 diabetes prevalence in Native Hawaiians. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data were analyzed from 495 Native Hawaiians, including acculturation modes, diabetes status, triglycerides, fasting insulin, BMI, age, and education level. Acculturation modes were assessed using an eight-item cultural affiliation questionnaire. RESULTS: Native Hawaiians in a traditional mode of acculturation were more likely to have type 2 diabetes (27.9%) than those in integrated (15.4%), assimilated (12.5%), or marginalized (10.5%) modes. CONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Native Hawaiians in a traditional mode of acculturation could not be attributed to any of the sociodemographic or biological factors included in this study. We discuss the role of psychosocial factors as possible mediators in the relationship between acculturation modes and type 2 diabetes.
