 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms within the transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) gene are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. It is widely hypothesised that the predisposing variation is involved in cis-regulation of TCF7L2 activity. The aim of this study was to seek evidence for the existence of novel TCF7L2 isoforms encoded within the type 2 diabetes-associated genomic region. METHODS: We searched expressed sequence tag (EST) databases for novel TCF7L2 transcripts and sought to validate the function and integrity of any isoforms found using a combination of RT-PCR, western blotting and reporter gene techniques. RESULTS: Analysis of EST databases suggested the presence of an alternative polyadenylation site located in intron 4 of TCF7L2. We used 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and real-time PCR to validate the integrity of this polyadenylation signal and show its wide use across human tissues. Western blotting results are consistent with the use of this polyadenylation signal to generate novel protein isoforms. The alternative polyadenylation signal results in the production of isoforms that retain the β-catenin binding domain but do not possess the high-mobility group box DNA-binding domain. Promoter-reporter gene assays suggest that these isoforms inhibit TCF7L2-dependent target genes by sequestering β-catenin. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We have identified a novel polyadenylation signal within TCF7L2 that can result in the production of isoforms that act to repress TCF/LEF-dependent target genes. These findings may provide new insights into the association of TCF7L2 with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.
