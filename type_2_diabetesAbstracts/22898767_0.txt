 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Inspired by recent speculation about the potential utility of α(2A)-antagonism in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, the study examined the contribution of α(2)-antagonism vs other mechanisms to the antihyperglycaemic activity of the imidazoline (±)-efaroxan. METHODS: Effects of the racemate and its pure enantiomers on isolated pancreatic islets and beta cells in vitro, as well as on hyperglycaemia in vivo, were investigated in a comparative manner in mice. RESULTS: In isolated perifused islets, the two enantiomers of efaroxan were equally potent in counteracting inhibition of insulin release by the ATP-dependent K(+) (K(ATP)) channel-opener diazoxide but (+)-efaroxan, the presumptive carrier of α(2)-antagonistic activity, was by far superior in counteracting inhibition of insulin release by the α(2)-agonist UK14,304. In vivo, (+)-efaroxan improved oral glucose tolerance at 100-fold lower doses than (-)-efaroxan and, in parallel with observations made in vitro, was more effective in counteracting UK14,304-induced than diazoxide-induced hyperglycaemia. The antihyperglycaemic activity of much higher doses of (-)-efaroxan was associated with an opposing pattern (i.e. with stronger counteraction of diazoxide-induced than UK14,304-induced hyperglycaemia), which implicates a different mechanism of action. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The antihyperglycaemic potency of (±)-efaroxan in mice is almost entirely due to α(2)-antagonism, but high doses can also lower blood glucose via another mechanism. Our findings call for reappraisal of the possible clinical utility of α(2A)-antagonistic compounds in recently identified subpopulations of patients in which a congenitally higher level of α(2A)-adrenergic activation contributes to the development and pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes.
