 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The relationship between cognitive function, cardiovascular disease and premature death is not well established in patients with type 2 diabetes. We assessed the effects of cognitive function in 11,140 patients with type 2 diabetes who participated in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial. Furthermore, we tested whether level of cognitive function altered the beneficial effects of the BP-lowering and glycaemic-control regimens in the trial. METHODS: Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination at baseline, and defined by scores 28-30 ('normal', n = 8,689), 24-27 ('mild dysfunction', n = 2,231) and <24 ('severe dysfunction', n = 212). Risks of major cardiovascular events, death and hypoglycaemia and interactions with treatment were assessed using Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: Relative to normal function, both mild and severe cognitive dysfunction significantly increased the multiple-adjusted risks of major cardiovascular events (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.11-1.46 and 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-1.99; both p < 0.05), cardiovascular death (1.41, 95% CI 1.16-1.71 and 1.56, 95% CI 0.99-2.46; both p <or= 0.05) and all-cause death (1.33, 95% CI 1.16-1.54 and 1.50, 95% CI 1.06-2.12; both p < 0.03). Severe, but not mild, cognitive dysfunction increased the risk of severe hypoglycaemia (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14-3.87; p = 0.018). There was no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effects on cardiovascular outcomes in subgroups defined by cognitive function at baseline. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Cognitive dysfunction is an independent predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes, but does not modify the effects of BP lowering or glucose control on the risks of major cardiovascular events.
