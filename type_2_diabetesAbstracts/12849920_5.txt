Serum paraoxonase (PON) is a high-density lipoprotein-bound enzyme that can prevent oxidation of low-density lipoprotein by hydrolyzing lipid peroxides and thus exert an anti-atherogenic effect. Recent studies have suggested that glutamine(Q isoform)/arginine(R isoform) polymorphism at position 192 of PON(1) gene is associated with macrovascular disease of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We re-investigated this relationship using carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) as a surrogate continuous variable for macroangiopathy. The genotype and allele frequency of PON(1) 192 Q/R polymorphism was assayed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 152 type 2 diabetic patients and 128 healthy subjects from a population of Chinese Han nationality in ChengDu area. The carotid IMT was measured by B-mode ultrasonography in type 2 diabetic patients. No differences were found in PON(1) gene Q/R polymorphism in the type 2 diabetic patients when compared with the control group. The mean carotid IMT in type 2 diabetic subjects with the QQ, QR and RR genotype was 0.65+/-0.27, 0.83+/-0.27 and 1.05+/-0.32 mm, respectively. One-way ANOVA showed that IMT was significantly greater in the RR subgroup than in both QR and QQ subgroups (P<0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed R allele to be the main determinant of IMT variability (OR 4.0 95% CI 2.10-7.40 P=0.005). Our data support the view that 192 R allele of PON(1) gene is a risk factor for macrovascular disease of T2DM in Chinese.
