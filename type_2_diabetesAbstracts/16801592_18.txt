 OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin encoded by the ADIPOQ gene modulates insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether ADIPOQ gene variants in the promoter region predict adiponectin levels and type 2 diabetes progression. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 550 subjects with increased risk of type 2 diabetes were investigated; they underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, repeated after 3 years. Adiponectin levels were analyzed, and two ADIPOQ promoter variant single nucleotide polymorphisms, -11391G>A and -11377C>G, were genotyped. RESULTS: Tertiles of the adjusted adiponectin levels were associated with single nucleotide polymorphism -11391G>A and -11377C>G haplotypes (P < 0.0001). Carriers of the intermediate/high-level haplotype combination showed a bisected diabetes risk at the 3-year follow-up and were characterized by a "regression" of glucose tolerance. Evolution of disease status correlates with preexisting low adiponectin levels at inclusion rather than with variation in adiponectin levels. CONCLUSIONS: We present data that gene variants in the ADIPOQ promoter region are associated with variations in adiponectin levels and thus with future type 2 diabetes and disease progression.
