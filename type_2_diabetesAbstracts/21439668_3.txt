The 12q24 locus is linked to microcirculation pathology and type 2 diabetes (T2D) with nephropathy and entails the PSMD9 gene linked to T2D. We tested the PSMD9 T2D risk SNPs IVS3+nt460A>G, IVS3+nt437T>C and E197G for linkage to T2D-diabetic nephropathy in 200 Italians T2D families and show linkage to diabetic nephropathy.
