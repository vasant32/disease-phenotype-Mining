 OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of a 2-day in-hospital diabetes educational program in preventing or delaying progression of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes, including analysis of changes in serum lipids, body weight, and blood pressure after the program. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 426 subjects (51 +/- 9 years, BMI 24.6 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2)) with newly diagnosed IGT were randomly assigned to three groups, 143 as the short-term hospitalization with diabetes education and support (STH) group, 141 as the nonhospitalization but diabetes education and support (DES) group, and 142 as the neither hospitalization nor education (control) group. RESULTS: The average follow-up was 3.1 years. The incidence of diabetes was 8.0, 10.7, and 13.2 cases per 100 person-years for STH, DES, and control groups, respectively. The incidence of diabetes was 42% lower (95% CI 33-51%) in the STH group and 27% lower (15-37%) in the DES group than in the control group. The incidence of diabetes was 21% lower (10-31%) in the STH group than in the DES group. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-day in-hospital program with diabetes education and support every 3 months was more effective in preventing or delaying the progression from IGT to diabetes than only diabetes education and support every 3 months.
