 AIM: Following the recent Ongoing Telmistartan Alone and in Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) finding of adverse renal outcomes, dual renin-angiotensin blockade has fallen out of favour, despite antihypertensive and antiproteinuric efficacy. However, in high-risk severe hypertension, not studied in ONTARGET, whether combination treatment should be withheld or withdrawn is not clear. We examine the renal effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy versus combination therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and varying degrees of hypertension. METHODS: Subjects attending a hospital diabetes centre were selected as case (combination therapy, n = 120) and control (monotherapy, n = 480). Subjects were matched for age, gender, ethnicity, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood pressure (BP) and study duration. Patients were stratified by BP, hypertension stage 1 (BP < 160/100, n = 506) and stage 2 (≥160/100, n = 94), and by treatment group. Data were analysed for the primary renal outcome of eGFR decline ≥20 ml/min, over a median of 3.7 years. RESULTS: In keeping with the ONTARGET study, for stage 1 hypertension, combination treatment is significantly worse than monotherapy for the primary outcome of eGFR decline ≥20 ml/min (20 vs. 10.7%, p = 0.01). In contrast, for stage 2 hypertension, this endpoint was reached less often for combination versus monotherapy (12.0 vs. 23.2%, p = 0.2). Combination treatment was also not detrimental in patients with proteinuria or eGFR < 60 ml/min and was associated with fewer macrovascular events. CONCLUSION: Given that hypertension control is paramount and in the spirit of primum non nocere, these data are reassuring should clinicians choose to use ACE-I and ARB combination therapy in the very hypertensive diabetic patient.
