We investigated the effect of olmesartan on early diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes by its replacement of other angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) by olmesartan. The urinary albumin/creatinine ratio significantly decreased. The present result suggests a possibility that olmesartan may have more effect on early nephropathy than other ARBs.
