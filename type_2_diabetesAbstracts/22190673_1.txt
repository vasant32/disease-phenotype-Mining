 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the proportion of individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes who perceive the need for lifestyle counseling, factors associated with this perception, and whether the perceived need is associated with subsequent attendance in lifestyle intervention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline and intervention data were obtained from 10,149 participants in a Finnish National Diabetes Prevention Project. RESULTS: In total, 36% of men and 52% of women perceived the need for counseling. Most of the risk factors did not increase the perceived need for counseling. Those agreeing to attend supervised lifestyle intervention were more likely to report a perceived need than those who agreed on a self-initiated lifestyle change or those who refused to attend lifestyle intervention. The perceived need was associated with actual attendance in the lifestyle intervention only among women. CONCLUSIONS: It will be vital to find additional means to support lifestyle change.
