 AIMS: This study was to investigate the relationship of gamma-glutamyl transferase to ferritin, and their interaction on the risk of type 2 diabetes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 436 men and 588 women were recruited. According to levels of GGT and ferritin, they were divided into three groups in each gender of each geological location (Urban or Rural), that is, Group 1 (both GGT and ferritin<median values), Group 2 (only GGT or ferritin ≥ median values), and group 3 (both GGT and ferritin ≥ median values). Odds ratios for T2D in group 2-3 compared with group 1 were analyzed by multiple logistic regressions. RESULTS: (1) The prevalence of glucose abnormalities increased across the three groups of female subjects. Correspondingly, MDA levels were also higher in group 3 than other groups. (2) GGT and ferritin were correlated with each other after controlling for BMI. (3) T2D risk was higher in group 3 than that in group 1 in female subjects, which was independent of age, BMI, and T2D family history. CONCLUSIONS: GGT and ferritin were correlated with each other, and had synergetic effect on the risk of T2D in women. The mechanism might be involved in enhanced oxidative stress.
