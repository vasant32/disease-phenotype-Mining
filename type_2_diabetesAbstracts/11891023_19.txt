A G-to-A (UCSNP-43) polymorphism of the calpain-10 gene was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (DM) in Mexican-American, and was postulated, together with a T-to-C (UCSNP-44) polymorphism, as a risk factor for DM. We examined the association of these genotypes with DM in Japanese. Eighty-one subjects with DM and 81 non-diabetic subjects (NGT) were recruited. The number of subjects with genotypes UCSNP-43 G/G, G/A and A/A were 76, 5 and 0, respectively, for the DM and NGT groups. The number of subjects with genotypes UCSNP-44 T/T, T/C and C/C were 66, 14 and 1 for the DM group and 64, 17 and 0 for the NGT group. There was no difference between the groups in terms of frequency of any genotype combinations. No association between the genotypes and DM was observed. We next examined the differences between the genotypes or genotype combinations in terms of the traits related to DM, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia. No differences were observed between the genotypes UCSNP43 G/G and G/A, between UCSNP-44 T/T and the others, or between the genotype combination UCSNP-43 G/G and UCSNP-44 T/T and the others, except that the individuals with the genotype combination had significantly increased serum cholesterol levels (212.6 +/- 34.3 vs. 198.5 +/- 29.9, P=0.020). The genotype combination might be a risk factor, not for DM, obesity and hypertension, but for increased serum cholesterol.
