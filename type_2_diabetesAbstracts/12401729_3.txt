The KCNJ10 gene is located within a region on chromosome 1q linked to type 2 diabetes in the Pima Indians and six other populations. We therefore investigated this gene as a potential type 2 diabetes candidate gene in Pima Indians. KCNJ10 consists of two exons, spans approximately 33 kb, and we identified eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one (SNP2) in the coding region leading to a Glu359Lys substitution. Association studies were carried out in a case-control group composed of 149 affected and 150 unaffected Pimas, and the linkage analysis was performed in a linkage set of 1,338 Pimas. SNP1 in the promoter and SNP2 in the intron, which were in a complete linkage disequilibrium, and SNP5 in the 3' untranslated region showed association with diabetes in the case-control group (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively). When genotyped in the linkage set, only the KCNJ10-SNP1 variant showed a modest association with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.01). KCNJ10-SNP1 is in a strong linkage disquilibrium with SNP14 of the adjacent KCNJ9 locus, which we previously found to be associated with type 2 diabetes. After adjustment for KCNJ10-SNP1, the original linkage score at this locus was marginally reduced from 3.1 to 2.9. We conclude that these variants in KCNJ10 are unlikely to be the cause of linkage of type 2 diabetes with 1q in Pima Indians.
