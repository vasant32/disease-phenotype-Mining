Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a heterogeneous syndrome, characterized by beta-cell failure in the setting of obesity-related insulin resistance. T2DM has a progressive course and is associated with a high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, regardless of the treatment used. The incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are secreted in the gut upon meal ingestion and lower blood glucose by glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and production. Exogenously administered GLP-1 lowers postprandial glucose excursions by inhibiting glucagon secretion and delaying gastric emptying, improves beta-cell function, and promotes satiety and weight loss. Native GLP-1 is degraded rapidly by the ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4. Thus, injectable DPP-4-resistant GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and oral DPP-4 inhibitors have been developed. Exenatide is the first GLP-1RA that became available for the treatment of T2DM patients. Exenatide has unique characteristics, as to date it is the only agent that addresses the multiple defects of the T2DM phenotype, including hyperglycaemia, islet-cell dysfunction, alimentary obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. In animals, exenatide also increased beta-cell mass. Long-term prospective studies in high-risk populations should address the potentially disease modifying effect of exenatide and its effect on CVD risk, in addition to its safety and tolerability.
