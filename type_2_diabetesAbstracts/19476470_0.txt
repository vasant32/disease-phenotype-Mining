 AIM: To assess the use of a new repaglinide/metformin fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this 26-week, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group trial, subjects poorly controlled with mono- or dual-oral antidiabetic therapy were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to receive a repaglinide/metformin FDC tablet either two times daily (BID) or three times daily (TID) or a rosiglitazone/metformin FDC tablet BID. The primary objective comprised two hypotheses tested in a hierarchical order: (i) that treatment with the repaglinide/metformin FDC BID is non-inferior to that of a rosiglitazone/metformin FDC tablet BID as measured by changes in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (results presented here) and (ii) if true, that treatment with the repaglinide/metformin FDC BID was non-inferior to that of the repaglinide/metformin FDC TID as measured by changes in HbA1c (results presented in a companion paper). Additional efficacy and safety end-points were also assessed. RESULTS: Of the 561 subjects randomized, 383 completed the study. Reductions in HbA1c values became apparent at earlier times for repaglinide/metformin FDC BID treatment than rosiglitazone/metformin FDC BID, and final changes in HbA1c were not significantly different between treatment arms (p = 0.8186); thus, the predefined statistical criterion for non-inferiority was met. Overall adverse event profiles were comparable between treatment groups, and no major hypoglycaemic episodes were reported during the study. CONCLUSIONS: The repaglinide/metformin FDC BID regimen showed efficacy that was non-inferior to that of the rosiglitazone/metformin FDC BID regimen currently in clinical use and a more rapid reduction of HbA1c values. Thus, repaglinide/metformin FDC BID is a clinically feasible alternative to rosiglitazone/metformin FDC BID.
