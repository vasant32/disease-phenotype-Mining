AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Secreted by adipocytes, adiponectin is a hormone that acts as an antidiabetic and anti-atherogenic adipokine. We recently cloned the genes encoding two adiponectin receptors (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2). The aim of this study was to examine whether ADIPOR1 and/or ADIPOR2 play a major role in genetic susceptibility to insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population. METHODS: By direct sequencing and a search of public databases, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2, and investigated whether these SNPs are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population. RESULTS: The linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the chromosomal region of ADIPOR1 was almost completely preserved, whereas the LD in ADIPOR2 was less well preserved. None of the SNPs in ADIPOR1 or ADIPOR2 were significantly associated with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. No differences in ADIPOR1 or ADIPOR2 haplotype frequencies were observed between type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Genetic variations in ADIPOR1 or ADIPOR2 are unlikely to lead to a common genetic predisposition to insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.
