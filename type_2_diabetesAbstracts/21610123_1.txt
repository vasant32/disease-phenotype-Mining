 OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of diacerein on insulin secretion and metabolic control in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 40 drug-naïve adult patients with type 2 diabetes. A metabolic profile including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and fasting insulin levels was carried out before the intervention and 2 months afterward. A hyperglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique was performed to assess the phases of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. After randomization, 20 patients received diacerein (50 mg once daily) for the first 15 days and twice daily for 45 additional days. The remaining patients received placebo. Intra- and intergroup differences were calculated by Wilcoxon signed rank and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: There were significant increases in first (102±63 vs. 130±75 pmol/L; P<0.01), late (219±111 vs. 280±135 pmol/L; P<0.01), and total insulin (178±91 vs. 216±99 pmol/L; P<0.01) secretions without changes in insulin sensitivity after diacerein administration. There were significant decreases in fasting glucose (7.9±1.4 vs. 6.8±1.0 mmol/L; P<0.01) and in A1C levels (8.3±1.0 vs. 7.0±0.8%; P<0.001) after diacerein administration. There were no significant changes after placebo administration in the above-mentioned evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin secretion increased and metabolic control improved after diacerein administration in drug-naïve patients with type 2 diabetes.
