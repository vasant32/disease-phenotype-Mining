The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy has increased everywhere in recent years. A number of studies have suggested that adverse maternal and fetal outcomes in these women have approached the figures for type 1 diabetic pregnancies. A low rate of planned pregnancies, suboptimal metabolic control and obesity have emerged as significant factors contributing towards poor outcome in these women, so efforts should be made to monitor these patients more carefully in order to improve this situation.
