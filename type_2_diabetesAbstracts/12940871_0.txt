AIMS: To compare lipoprotein risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) treated with a sulphonylurea (SU) compound only, metformin (MET) only, or combined SU + MET. METHODS: The study population consisted of 62 patients with type 2 DM, whose antihyperglycaemic treatment program had been stable for at least 3 months, divided into three groups: 26 patients in the SU group, 17 patients in the MET group and 19 patients in the SU + MET group. None of the patients were taking lipid-lowering drugs. Fasting venous blood samples were taken to measure concentrations of glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and remnant lipoprotein-cholesterol (RLP-C) as well as for determination of LDL particle diameter. RESULTS: The three groups were similar in terms of age, gender, body mass index and fasting plasma glucose concentrations. Total cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0.05 for trend) in those treated with SU + MET as compared with the other two groups. However, there were no significant differences between the three groups in their plasma concentrations of TG, LDL-C, HDL-C or RLP-C; furthermore, the proportion of individuals within each treatment group with small LDL particle diameter was also not different. CONCLUSIONS: The lipoprotein profile of patients with type 2 DM, matched for level of fasting hyperglycaemia, was similar irrespective of treatment with SU alone, MET alone or SU + MET. Thus, we could not identify any changes in lipoprotein metabolism that could account for differences in risk of CVD as a function of treatment.
