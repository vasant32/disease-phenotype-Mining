We compared clinical and metabolic characteristics and estimated cardiovascular risk for 2073 new cases of type 2 diabetes enrolled on the Otago Diabetes Register, 1998-2004 by age at diagnosis (<40 years, 40-59 years, 60-79 years, >79 years). Data were extracted and means or proportions calculated. 5-year cardiovascular risk was estimated using New Zealand risk equation tables. The <40 year age group had the highest proportion of current smokers (27%). Weight, body mass index and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly with increasing age from 104.2 kg, 35.9 kg/m(2) and 80.5 mmHg, respectively, for the <40 year age group to 71.6 kg, 26.9 kg/m(2) and 76.2 mmHg, respectively, for the > or =80 year age group (p<0.01). The reverse trend was observed for systolic blood pressure. HbA1c and triglycerides were significantly higher and HDL-cholesterol significantly lower in the <40 year age group compared with other groups (p<0.001). Estimated 5-year risk of cardiovascular disease was lower in the young age group when compared with older age groups despite, overall, having the worst array of modifiable clinical risk factors. A new approach to assessment and communication of cardiovascular risk and aggressive treatment of modifiable risk factors is likely to be necessary to prevent potentially serious diabetes complications at a young age.
