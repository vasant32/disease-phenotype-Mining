Over the past 5 years, microarrays have greatly facilitated large-scale analysis of gene expression levels. Although these arrays were not specifically geared to represent tissues and pathways known to be affected by diabetes, they have been used in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes research. To prepare a tool that is particularly useful in the study of type 1 diabetes, we have assembled a nonredundant set of 3,400 clones representing genes expressed in the mouse pancreas or pathways known to be affected by diabetes. We have demonstrated the usefulness of this clone set by preparing a cDNA glass microarray, the PancChip, and using it to analyze pancreatic gene expression from embryonic day 14.5 through adulthood in mice. The clone set and corresponding array are useful resources for diabetes research.
