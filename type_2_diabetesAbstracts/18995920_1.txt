Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in type 2 diabetic patients was compared across 14 countries. There was an unexpectedly high SMBG-use in non-insulin-treated patients. Reimbursement polices differed by country, region, insurance status, and patient income. More rigorous and systematic data collection is needed to ensure evidence-based SMBG-use.
