OBJECTIVE: This multicenter study was designed to explore the prevalence of clinical and subclinical eating disorders (EDs), the extent of intentional omission of insulin and oral antidiabetic agents, and its relationship to glycemic control in an inpatient and outpatient population of men and women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data have been collected from 12 diabetes medical centers in two German cities. In a questionnaire and interview-based study, a sample of male and female patients (n = 341 type 1, n = 322 type 2) was assessed for the following eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and eating disorder not otherwise specified. For lack of interview data of several patients meeting the screening criteria, prevalence ranges were calculated. RESULTS: The overall prevalence range of current EDs was 5.9-8.0% (lifetime prevalence 10.3-14.0%). When patients were stratified according to type 1 and type 2 diabetes, there was no difference in prevalence of EDs. However, the distribution of the EDs was different in both types of diabetes, with a predominance of binge eating disorder in the type 2 diabetes sample. Type 1 (5.9%) and type 2 (2.2%) diabetic patients reported deliberate omission of hyperglycemic drugs (insulin or oral agents) in order to lose weight. Compared with control subjects, neither the presence of EDs nor insulin omission influenced diabetic control. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be no difference in prevalence rates of EDs in both types of diabetes; however, distribution of EDs is different. The findings suggest that neither EDs nor insulin omission are necessarily associated with poor control of glycemia. Binge eating disorder seems to precede type 2 diabetes in most patients and could be one of the causes of obesity that often precedes type 2 diabetes.
