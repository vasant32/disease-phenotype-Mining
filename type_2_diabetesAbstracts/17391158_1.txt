AIM: Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction has been reported to be prevalent in diabetic subjects, but this recognition could often be missed. We evaluated prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction and diagnostic utility of brain-natriuretic peptide (BNP) in asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma BNP levels and LV geometry and diastolic filling indices, including the ratio of peak early transmitral Doppler flow (E) over flow propagation velocity (Vp) measured by colour M-mode Doppler echocardiography, were analysed in 98 consecutive asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 51 age-matched controls. RESULTS: The LV mass index and relative wall thickness were higher in diabetic groups than controls without any differences in LV systolic function. The frequency of diastolic dysfunction defined as E/Vp > or = 1.5 were 31% in diabetic groups and 15% in controls (chi(2) = 4.364, p = 0.037). By receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, a BNP cutoff value of 19.2 pg/ml in controls had a 53.1% positive predictive value (53.1%) and a high negative predictive value (94.4%) for E/Vp >/= 1.5, whereas a BNP cutoff value of 18.1 pg/ml in diabetic groups had a 61.8% positive and 97.3% negative predictive values. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of E/Vp > or = 1.5 was higher in asymptomatic diabetic patients, suggesting that LV diastolic dysfunction was prevalent. The plasma concentration of BNP could be used to depict LV diastolic dysfunction in such population.
