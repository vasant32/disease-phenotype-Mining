 AIMS: Although the clinical implications of prolonged Q-T interval have been described, the clinical determinants of Q-T interval in type 2 diabetes mellitus are not clear. We examined the influencing factors of QTc in type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This study involved 207 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 141 healthy controls. QTc was estimated from resting lead II electrocardiogram. Data analysis was done using unpaired Student's 't' and Pearson correlation tests. RESULTS: Only female diabetics with somatic neuropathy had longer QTc compared to controls (p<0.01). Only in male diabetics negative correlation was found between QTc and heart rate response to deep breathing (p<0.01). Male and female study subjects with diabetic retinopathy had longer QTc compared to controls (p<0.01, 0.05). Only male diabetics with hypertension had longer QTc compared to controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: QTc prolongation is associated with diabetic neuropathy with sex difference in its manifestation. It is influenced by diabetic retinopathy in male and female diabetics. It is influenced by hypertension in male type 2 diabetics.
