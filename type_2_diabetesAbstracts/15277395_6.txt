The neurogenic differentiation-1 (NEUROD1), neurogenin-3 (NEUROG3), and hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha (TCF1) genes are interacting transcription factors implicated in controlling islet cell development and insulin secretion. Polymorphisms of these genes (Ala45Thr [NEUROD1], Ser199Phe [NEUROG3], and Ala98Val [TCF1]) have been postulated to influence the development of type 2 diabetes. We have investigated the role and interaction between these variants using PCR/restriction fragment-length polymorphism assays in 454 subjects recruited as part of a population survey in South India. Additionally, 97 South Indian parent-offspring trios were studied. Polymorphisms of all three genes were associated with either fasting blood glucose (FBG) and/or 2-h blood glucose (BG) in either the total dataset or when restricted to a normoglycemic population. A monotonically increasing effect, dependent on the total number of risk-associated alleles carried, was observed across the whole population (P < 0.0001 for FBG and 2-h BG), raising FBG by a mean of 2.9 mmol/l and 2-h BG by a mean of 4.3 mmol/l. Similarly, an ascending number of the same risk alleles per subject increased the likelihood of type 2 diabetes (P = 0.002). In conclusion, we observed a combined effect of variations in NEUROD1, NEUROG3, and TCF1 in contributing to overall glucose intolerance in a South Indian population.
