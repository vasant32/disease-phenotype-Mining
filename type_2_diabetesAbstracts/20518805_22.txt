 AIM: To assess the safety of vildagliptin versus all comparators (ACs) with regard to organs, systems or tissues of particular interest in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and areas of potential concern with dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inhibitors. METHODS: Data were pooled from 38 studies where vildagliptin was given for > or =12 to > 104 weeks in patients with T2DM. Absolute and exposure-adjusted incidence rates and Peto odds ratios (ORs) versus ACs with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: There were > 7000 subject-years of exposure (SYE) to vildagliptin 50 mg bid and > 6500 SYE to ACs. For mild hepatic enzyme elevations with and without elevated bilirubin levels, the ORs for vildagliptin 50 mg bid were 1.24 (95% CI: [0.80, 1.93]) and 1.19 (95% CI: [0.29, 4.90]), respectively. The exposure-adjusted incidences of markedly elevated hepatic enzymes and for enzyme elevations with bilirubin > or = 2x ULN with vildagliptin 50 mg bid were < or = those in the ACs group. For hepatic and pancreatitis-related AEs, the ORs for vildagliptin 50 mg bid were 0.87 (95% CI: [0.64, 1.19]) and 0.70 (95% CI: [0.26, 1.88]), respectively, and for any AE in the infections and infestations SOC, this was 1.04 (95% CI: [0.96, 1.13]). The incidences of skin-related AEs were low and the risk with vildagliptin 50 mg bid was not significantly different from ACs [(OR = 1.10 (95% CI: [0.80, 1.51])]. CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analyses indicate that vildagliptin was not associated with increased risk of hepatic events or hepatic enzyme elevations indicative of drug-induced liver injury, pancreatitis, infections or skin-related toxicity.
