In the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, a genetic model of type 2 diabetes, the neonatal beta-cell mass deficit is considered to be the primary defect leading to basal hyperglycemia, which is detectable for the first time 3 weeks after birth. We investigated in GK females the short- and the long-term effects of a treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or its long-acting analog exendin-4 (Ex-4) during the first postnatal week (during the prediabetic period). GK rats were treated with daily injections of glucagon-like peptide-1 (400 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or Ex-4 (3 microg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) from day 2 to day 6 after birth and were evaluated against Wistar and untreated GK rats. Under these conditions, on day 7 both treatments enhanced pancreatic insulin content and total beta-cell mass by stimulating beta-cell neogenesis and regeneration. Follow-up of biological characteristics from day 7 to adult age (2 months) showed that such a GLP-1 or Ex-4 treatment exerted long-term favorable influences on beta-cell mass and glycemic control at adult age. As compared to untreated GK rats, 2-month-old treated rats exhibited significantly decreased basal plasma glucose. Their glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, in vivo after intravenous glucose load or in vitro using isolated perfused pancreas, was slightly improved. This contributed at least partly to improve the in vivo plasma glucose disappearance rate, which was found to be increased in both treated GK groups compared to the untreated GK group. These findings in the GK model indicated, for the first time, that GLP-1 or Ex-4 treatment limited to the prediabetic period delays the installation and limits the severity of type 2 diabetes. Under these conditions, GLP-1 represents a unique tool because of its beta-cell replenishing effect in spontaneously diabetic rodents. It may prove to be an invaluable agent for the prevention of human type 2 diabetes.
