 AIM: To compare effects of three different insulin secretagogues on early-phase insulin secretion, metabolism of glucose and lipids, and lipid peroxidation in newly diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Totally 60 newly diagnosed T2DM outpatients were randomized to three groups with 1-month monotherapy of repaglinide (Rg), glimepiride (Gm) or gliclazide MR (Gli), respectively. Some indexes of early-phase insulin secretion, glucose, lipids, and lipid peroxidation were inspected. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and fructosamine (FA) were improved in all groups similarly (p>0.05). Rg group was with the highest early-phase insulin secretion index (DeltaI30/DeltaG30) (p=0.026), lower mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion (MAGE) (p<0.05), lowest mean peak value of post-lunch glucose (p=0.043), and lowest postprandial triglyceride (TG) (p=0.039). Postprandial free fatty acid (FFA) was lower after Rg and Gli treatment (p<0.05). Serum 8-iso prostaglandin F(2alpha) (8-iso PGF(2alpha)) was improved in all groups, but the improvement showed statistically significant only in Rg group (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: Rg, Gm and Gli can all decrease blood glucose effectively in newly diagnosed T2DM patients, while Rg performs outstandingly in the aspects of improving early-phase insulin secretion, glucose excursion, postprandial lipids and 8-iso PGF(2alpha).
