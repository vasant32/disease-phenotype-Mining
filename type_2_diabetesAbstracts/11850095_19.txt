This cross-sectional study presents the first normative data on pedometer-determined ambulatory activity, defined as steps/day, in 160 (98 males, 62 females; age=52.4 +/- 5.3 years; BMI=32.3 +/- 5.7) free-living individuals with type 2 diabetes. Participants took 6662 +/- 3077 steps per day, less than that reported in nondiabetic samples and more than that reported for samples living with more restrictive chronic conditions including claudication, joint replacement, chronic obstructive lung disease, and chronic heart failure. Steps/day and BMI were inversely and significantly correlated (r=-0.27, P<0.01). Further, there was a significant difference between BMI categories (from normal weight to obesity class III) with regard to steps/day (F=2.96, P<0.05). The difference was most apparent between the highest obesity classes (II and III) and normal weight categories. This data is useful for sample comparison purposes. In addition the standard deviation or variance estimates can be used to calculate samples sizes for intervention efforts. Objective quantification of ambulatory activity via simple and inexpensive pedometers permits researchers and practitioners to easily screen for level of activity along a continuum. This study opens the door for future research and clinical applications including identifying threshold values related to important health outcomes and evaluating incremental change due to various interventions in this population.
