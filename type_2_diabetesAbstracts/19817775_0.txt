Upon completion of the activity, participants should be better able to: 1. State the benefits of insulin analogues in the management of type 2 diabetes. 2. Cite the rationale for the earlier use of insulin in modern treatment algorithms to reduce the burden of type 2 diabetes. 3. Select starting insulin analogue treatment strategies for patients who are not at treatment goals with metformin + lifestyle intervention. 4. Explain how to involve patients in diabetes self-management through patient-driven insulin analogue titration to achieve A1C goals. 5. Identify patients who might benefit from early intensive insulin therapy at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. 6. Explain how to intensify insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes through the use of either basal plus or basal-bolus therapy or through the use of premixed insulin analogues.
