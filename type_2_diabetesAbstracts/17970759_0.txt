 AIM: We investigated the effects of the combined therapy of PPARgamma and PPARalpha agonists on HDL metabolism, especially concerning reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), using Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/Crl-Lepr fa rats) that are the rodent model for type 2 diabetes with obesity, hyperlipidaemia and insulin resistance. METHODS: The ZDF rats were divided into four medicated groups as follows: pioglitazone as a PPARgamma agonist (5 mg/kg/day; P group, n = 6), fenofibrate as a PPARalpha agonist (30 mg/kg/day; F group, n = 6), both these medications (P + F group, n = 6) and no treatment (UNT group, n = 6). Non-diabetic rats (ZDF/GmiCrl-lean, CON group, n = 6) served as controls. We evaluated HDL particle size and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the following factors: liver X receptor alpha (L x R alpha), ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 which are regulated by PPARs and are related to early stage RCT. RESULTS: The significant increase in HDL particle size was demonstrated in rats of the F and P + F groups, although changes in plasma HDL-cholesterol levels were not significant. In accordance with this finding, mRNA levels of ABCG1 in the liver increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the efficacy of combined therapy with PPARgamma and PPARalpha in improving lipid metabolism, partly through the enhanced RCT, and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
