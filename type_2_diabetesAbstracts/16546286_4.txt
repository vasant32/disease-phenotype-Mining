Patients with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The combinations of the haplotype created by the alleles of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): SNP-43, -19, and -63 of the Calpain-10 gene (CAPN10), have been reported to be associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes in many populations. The aim of this study was to examine the association of the CAPN10 polymorphism with metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes in Korea. Overall, 382 patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. All the subjects were genotyped according to CAPN10 SNP-43, -19, and -63. The restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used for the three SNPs. The baseline presence of components of metabolic syndrome was determined. Two hundred and sixty-five (69.4%) patients had metabolic syndrome. Patients with the 111/121 haplotype combination showed a higher risk of hypertension than the other haplotype combinations (odd ratio (OR)=2.334, P=0.010). Patients with the 111/121 haplotype combination had a significantly high risk of metabolic syndrome (OR=1.927, P=0.042). The results of this study suggest that a novel 111/121 haplotype combination created by the CAPN10 SNP-43, -19, and -63 increases the susceptibility to the metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes.
