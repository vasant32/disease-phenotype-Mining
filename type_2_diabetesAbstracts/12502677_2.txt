 OBJECTIVE: Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity is required for insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 transporters and glucose uptake and utilization. Therefore, genes encoding the subunits of PI 3-kinase are promising candidate genes for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. We recently cloned the catalytic subunit p110beta gene of human PI 3-kinase and reported two nucleotide polymorphisms, -359T/C and -303A/G, in the promoter region of this gene. In this study, we determined the effects of these polymorphisms on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied two separate groups of Finnish nondiabetic subjects. Insulin secretion was evaluated by intravenous glucose tolerance test and insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. RESULTS: Our results showed that the -359T/C and -303A/G polymorphisms did not have a significant effect on fasting plasma insulin levels, insulin secretion, or insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that the promoter polymorphisms -359T/C and -303A/G of the catalytic subunit p110beta gene of human PI 3-kinase have a major impact on insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, or the risk of type 2 diabetes in Finnish subjects.
