 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of rosiglitazone on adiponectin and plasma glucose levels in relation with common adiponectin gene (ACDC) polymorphisms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 166 patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with rosiglitazone (4 mg/day) for 12 weeks without changing any of their previous medications. In all, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)45 and SNP276 of ACDC were examined. RESULTS: Regarding SNP45, there was a smaller reduction in the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level and the HbA(1c) value in the carriers of the GG genotype than in the carriers of the other genotypes (P = 0.031 and 0.013, respectively). There was a smaller increase in the serum adiponectin concentration for the GG genotype than for the other genotypes (P = 0.003). Regarding SNP276, there was less reduction in the FPG level for the GG genotype than for the other genotypes (P = 0.001). In the haplotype analysis, the reductions in the FPG and HbA(1c) levels were smaller for the GG homozygote haplotype than for the other haplotypes (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). The increase in the plasma adiponectin concentration for the GG homozygote haplotype was smaller than that of the other haplotypes (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that genetic variations in the adiponectin gene can affect the rosiglitazone treatment response of the circulating adiponectin level and blood glucose control in type 2 diabetic patients.
