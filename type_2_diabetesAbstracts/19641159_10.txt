 OBJECTIVE: Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) is a chemokine involved into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and has prognostic value in the acute and chronic phases in patients with acute coronary syndromes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: MCP-1/CCL2 concentration was measured in plasma fractions of 363 middle-aged overweight/obese individuals (aged 61 +/- 12 years, BMI 30.1 +/- 6.6 kg/m(2), 15% with type 2 diabetes, and 12% with impaired glucose tolerance) of a population survey carried out in 1990-1991 in Lombardy, Italy (Cremona Study), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality was assessed in 2006 through Regional Health Registry files. RESULTS: At baseline MCP-1/CCL2 was increased in individuals with type 2 diabetes (P < 0.05) and showed significant correlations with biochemical risk markers of atherosclerosis. After 15 years, among the 363 subjects, there were 82 deaths due to CVD. In univariate analysis age, sex, fasting glucose and insulin, fibrinogen, glucose tolerance status, smoking habit, and MCP-1/CCL2 were associated with CVD mortality. Age, sex, fasting serum glucose, MCP-1/CCL2, and smoking habit maintained an independent association with CVD mortality in multiple regression analysis. In a subgroup of 113 subjects in whom data for C-reactive protein (CRP) were available, its level was not predictive of CVD mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged overweight/obese individuals MCP-1/CCL2 was independently associated with CVD mortality. Further studies will be necessary to establish its role as a surrogate biomarker and as a potential therapeutic target.
