GLP-1 analogues (incretin mimetics) and DPP-4 inhibitors (incretin enhancers) represent new classes of anti-diabetic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of the incretin mimetic exenatide and of the DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin and vildagliptin, have been clearly demonstrated by a very large number of clinical trials. Efficacy was demonstrated in terms of reduction of HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose. Moreover, exenatide showed a favourable effect on weight, while DPP-4 inhibitors were neutral with respect to this outcome. The low rate of hypoglycemic events seen in all studies confirms the glucose dependent action of incretins.
