Adiponectin, also referred to as AdipoQ or ACRP30, is a plasma protein produced and secreted exclusively from adipose tissue. The protein contains a collagen-like domain and a C1q-like globular domain. A protease-generated globular segment enhances fatty acid oxidation in muscles, thereby modulating lipid and glucose metabolism. Plasma adiponectin levels are inversely correlated with the severity of insulin resistance. A recent genome-wide scan study mapped a susceptibility locus for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome to chromosome 3q27, where the adiponectin gene is located. Here, we screened Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and age- and BMI-matched nondiabetic control subjects for mutations in adiponectin gene. We identified four missense mutations (R112C, I164T, R221S, and H241P) in the globular domain. Among these mutations, the frequency of I164T mutation was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic patients than in age- and BMI- matched control subjects (P < 0.01). Furthermore, plasma adiponectin concentrations of subjects carrying I164T mutation were lower than those of subjects without the mutation. All the subjects carrying I164T mutation showed some feature of metabolic syndrome, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Our findings suggest that I164T mutation is associated with low plasma adiponectin concentration and type 2 diabetes.
