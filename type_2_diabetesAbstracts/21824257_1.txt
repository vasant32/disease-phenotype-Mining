Multiple approaches have been investigated with the ultimate goal of providing insulin independence to patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Approaches to produce insulin-secreting cells in culture, convert non-β-cells into functional β-cells or engineer autologous cells to express and secrete insulin in a meal-responsive manner have all been described. This research has been facilitated by significant improvements in both viral and non-viral gene delivery approaches that have enabled new experimental strategies. Many studies have examined possible avenues to confer islet cytoprotection against immune rejection, inflammation and apoptosis by genetic manipulation of islet cells prior to islet transplantation. Here we review several reports based on the reprogramming of pancreas and gut endocrine cells to treat diabetes.
