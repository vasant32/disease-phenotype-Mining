 OBJECTIVE: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) lists seven symptoms of diabetes; however, it is not known how specific these symptoms are for initial diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The Study to Help Improve Early evaluation and management of risk factors Leading to Diabetes (SHIELD) examined prevalence of ADA symptoms and their association with diabetes diagnosis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SHIELD is a 5-year observational study of individuals with or at risk for diabetes diagnosis. Following an initial screening phase, follow-up questionnaires were mailed to a stratified random sample of individuals (n = 22,001) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or at high (three to five risk factors) or low (zero to two risk factors) risk for diabetes. Individuals reported whether they experienced each ADA symptom, as well as symptoms unrelated to diabetes. RESULTS: A total of 15,794 questionnaires were returned (response rate 71.8%). All ADA symptoms were reported more frequently in type 2 diabetes than in low- and high-risk groups (P < 0.0001 for each). Multivariable logistic regression analyses found that each ADA symptom other than irritability was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes, as was erectile/sexual dysfunction. However, 48% of type 1 diabetic and 44% of type 2 diabetic respondents reported no ADA symptom in the previous year. CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of ADA symptoms alone may not adequately identify those who should be evaluated for type 2 diabetes. Longitudinal data from SHIELD will evaluate whether combinations of symptoms or addition of other symptoms can better identify individuals for evaluation.
