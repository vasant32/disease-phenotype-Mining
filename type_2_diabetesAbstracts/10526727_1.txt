OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between macronutrient intake and lipoprotein profile among individuals with type 2 diabetes who participated in the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study (SLVDS) or the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diet was assessed by 24-h recall in the SLVDS (n = 421) and by validated food frequency interview in the IRAS (n = 437). Analyses adjusted for kilocalories, age, sex, and other covariates were conducted separately for the two study groups. For the SLVDS, repeated observations were included in mixed model analyses (865 observations). For the IRAS, standard regression analyses were conducted. Recent weight history and time of diabetes diagnosis were evaluated as possible modifiers of associations between nutrient intake and lipoprotein profile. RESULTS: Higher reported intake of total dietary fat was related to significantly higher levels of LDL cholesterol (P < 0.05) in both studies and in all subgroups. Reported intake of total and saturated fat was associated positively with total cholesterol, although statistical significance was not reached for all subgroups. Higher reported carbohydrate intake was associated with increased triglyceride concentrations (P < 0.01) only among individuals with previously undiagnosed diabetes in the SLVDS (n = 69) and only among individuals who gained weight (> 5 lb, n = 87) during the previous year in the IRAS. CONCLUSIONS: Toward the goal of optimizing the lipoprotein profile of individuals with diabetes, these results emphasize the potential importance of reducing fat intake while recognizing that individualized approaches to diet are important to minimize the risk of cardiovascular disease.
