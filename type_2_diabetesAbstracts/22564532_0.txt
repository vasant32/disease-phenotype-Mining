The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat, a type 2 diabetes model, has increased pancreatic islet and white adipose tissue (WAT) blood flow, and this can be normalized by acute administration of SR59230A, a β₃ -adrenoceptor antagonist. We now implanted osmotic pumps which allowed a constant release of saline or SR59230A (0.6 mg/kg × day) for 2 weeks. A decrease in islet blood flow was seen also after 2 weeks of continuous SR59230A treatment in the GK rat. However, no improvement in glucose tolerance was seen in the GK rats. Neither did SR59230A affect insulin secretion from isolated islets in vitro. WAT blood flow was not affected by the 2-week SR59230A treatment. Thus, the increased islet blood flow seen in the GK rat can be normalized for up to 2 weeks, which opens the possibilities for further studies on the long-term functional role on the islet blood flow increase in this type 2 diabetes model.
