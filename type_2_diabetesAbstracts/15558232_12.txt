AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 diabetes is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Monocyte recruitment and inflammatory activation are crucial steps in the development of atherosclerosis and several receptors are involved in these processes. The aim of this study was to investigate levels of CD14 and the beta(2)-integrin subunits CD11b and CD18 on monocytes from women with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. METHODS: A population-based sample of 112 Swedish women, who were aged 64 years and had diabetes mellitus or impaired or normal glucose tolerance, was investigated. Cell surface receptors were analysed with flow cytometry and serum inflammation markers and soluble adhesion molecules with enzyme-linked methods. RESULTS: The monocytic CD14 expression and serum levels of C-reactive protein, IL-6 and soluble adhesion molecules were higher in the diabetes group than in the group with normal glucose tolerance. Monocytic CD18 was elevated both in the diabetes and in the impaired glucose tolerance groups. The levels of monocytic surface markers correlated with BMI and to a lesser extent with glycaemic control. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The increased monocytic expression of important surface receptors together with elevated serum inflammation markers supports the concept of increased inflammation in type 2 diabetes and may be an important factor for the risk of atherosclerosis.
