 OBJECTIVE: To examine the psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the Problem Areas In Diabetes (PAID-C) scale. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The reliability and validity of the PAID-C were evaluated in a convenience sample of 205 outpatients with type 2 diabetes. Confirmatory factor analysis, Bland-Altman analysis, and Spearman's correlations facilitated the psychometric evaluation. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a one-factor structure of the PAID-C (chi(2)/df ratio = 1.894, goodness-of-fit index = 0.901, comparative fit index = 0.905, root mean square error of approximation = 0.066). The PAID-C was associated with A1C (r(s) = 0.15; P < 0.05) and diabetes self-care behaviors in general diet (r(s) = -0.17; P < 0.05) and exercise (r(s) = -0.17; P < 0.05). The 4-week test-retest reliability demonstrated satisfactory stability (r(s) = 0.83; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The PAID-C is a reliable and valid measure to determine diabetes-related emotional distress in Chinese people with type 2 diabetes.
