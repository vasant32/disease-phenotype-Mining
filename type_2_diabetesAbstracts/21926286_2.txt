OBJECTIVE To evaluate the performance of the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in type 2 diabetic patients with GFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a cross-sectional study including 105 type 2 diabetic patients. GFR was measured by (51)Cr-EDTA method and estimated by the MDRD and CKD-EPI equations. Serum creatinine was measured by the traceable Jaffe method. Bland-Altman plots were used. Bias, accuracy (P30), and precision were evaluated. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 57 ± 8 years; 53 (50%) were men and 90 (86%) were white. Forty-six (44%) patients had microalbuminuria, and 14 (13%) had macroalbuminuria. (51)Cr-EDTA GFR was 103 ± 23, CKD-EPI GFR was 83 ± 15, and MDRD-GFR was 78 ± 17 mL/min/1.73 m² (P < 0.001). Accuracy (95% CI) was 67% (58-74) for CKD-EPI and 64% (56-75) for MDRD. Precision was 21 and 22, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The CKD-EPI and MDRD equations pronouncedly underestimated GFR in type 2 diabetic patients.
