 AIMS: To analyse clinical characteristics and treatment results in unselected type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, with non-pharmacological treatment as well as the most commonly used pharmacological glucose-lowering treatment regimens, in everyday clinical practice. METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, information was linked from the Swedish National Diabetes Register, Prescribed Drug Register and Patient Register. T2DM patients with non-pharmacological treatment and T2DM patients continuously using the 12 most common pharmacological treatment regimens were included in the study (n = 163121). RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in clinical characteristics between the groups. Patients with insulin-based treatment regimens had the longest duration of diabetes and more cardiovascular risk factors than the T2DM-population in general. The proportion of patients reaching HbA1c ≤ 7% varied between 70.1% (metformin) and 25.0% [premixed insulin (PMI) + SU) in patients with pharmacological treatment. 84.8% of the patients with non-pharmacological treatment reached target. Compared to patients on metformin, patients on other pharmacological treatments had a lower likelihood, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-0.63 to 0.97;0.94-0.99, of having HbA1c ≤ 7% (adjusted for covariates). Patients on insulin-based treatments had the lowest likelihood, while non-pharmacological treatment was associated with an increased likelihood of having HbA1c ≤ 7%. CONCLUSION: This nation-wide study shows insufficiently reached treatment goals for haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in all treatment groups. Patients on insulin-based treatment regimens had the longest duration of diabetes, more cardiovascular risk factors and the highest proportions of patients not reaching HbA1c target.
