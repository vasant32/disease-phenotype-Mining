OBJECTIVE: The study compared the long-term efficacy and safety of miglitol to placebo in Type 2 diabetic outpatients inadequately controlled on combination therapy of diet, glibenclamide and metformin. METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients (n = 154) receiving glibenclamide 7-20 mg/day and at least one 500-850 mg tablet metformin per day were randomized to receive additional miglitol or placebo for 24 weeks, titrated up stepwise from 25 to 100 mg trice daily. RESULTS: Addition of miglitol to sulphonylureas and metformin (per protocol analysis) produced a statistically, significantly greater reduction in HbA1c (-0.55%, P = 0.04) and postprandial glucose (-2.6 mmol/l, P = 0.0009) from baseline to endpoint than placebo (-0.2% and -0.6 mol/l, respectively). Reduction in fasting blood glucose was greater with miglitol than placebo, and there was a possible difference in favor of miglitol for fasting and postprandial triglyceride levels, but these did not reach statistical significance. Flatulence and diarrhea were reported by statistically, significantly more patients receiving miglitol than placebo, but adverse events overall were reported by only 10% more patients in the miglitol group. No cases of hypoglycaemia were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Miglitol can safely and effectively be added to long-term combination therapy in people with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with glibenclamide plus metformin.
