 OBJECTIVE: Inflammation is associated with both chronic kidney dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. Adiponectin, a novel circulating anti-inflammatory protein made by adipocytes, has been reported to be lower in diabetic than nondiabetic subjects. In contrast, serum levels of adiponectin are elevated in end-stage renal disease. We sought to investigate the relation between adiponectin and mild to moderate renal dysfunction in men with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the relation between serum adiponectin concentrations and the presence of renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) by the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) in participants with type 2 diabetes in the Health Professionals' Follow-Up Study. A total of 733 men were included in this cross-sectional analysis. RESULTS: Adiponectin was positively correlated with age (Spearman coefficient, r = 0.19, P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with weight (Spearman coefficient, r = -0.18, P < 0.001). Those with adiponectin in the second quartile or higher (>10 microg/ml) compared with those in the first quartile had a reduced odds for renal dysfunction (multivariate odds ratio 0.48 [95% CI 0.28-0.81]). These results were unchanged when serum lipids were included in the multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a higher serum adiponectin concentration is associated with reduced odds of moderate renal dysfunction in men with type 2 diabetes.
