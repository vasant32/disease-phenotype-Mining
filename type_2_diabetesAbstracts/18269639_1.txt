 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of Metformin and Glyburide on cardiovascular, metabolic and hormonal parameters during progressive exercise performed to exhaustion in the post-prandial state in women with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten T2DM patients treated with Metformin (M group), 10 with Glyburide (G group) and 10 age-paired healthy subjects exercised on a bicycle ergometer up to exercise peak. Cardiovascular and blood metabolic and hormonal parameters were measured at times -60 min, 0 min, exercise end, and at 10 and 20 minutes of recovery phase. Thirty minutes before the exercise, a standard breakfast was provided to all participants. The diabetic patients took Metformin or Glyburide before or with meal. RESULTS: Peak oxygen uptake (VO(2)) was lower in patients with diabetes. Plasma glucose levels remained unchanged, but were higher in both diabetic groups. Patients with diabetes also presented lower insulin levels after meals and higher glucagon levels at exercise peak than C group. Serum cortisol levels were higher in G than M group at exercise end and recovery phase. Lactate levels were higher in M than G group at fasting and in C group at exercise peak. Nor epinephrine, GH and FFA responses were similar in all 3 groups. CONCLUSION: Progressive exercise performed to exhaustion, in the post-prandial state did not worsen glucose control during and after exercise. The administration of the usual dose of Glyburide or Metformin to T2DM patients did not influence the cardiovascular, metabolic and hormonal response to exercise.
