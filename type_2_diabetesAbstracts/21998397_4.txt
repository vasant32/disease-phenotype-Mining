 OBJECTIVE: Inflammation is an important factor in the development of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver disease. As a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF9) expressed on immune cells, 4-1BB/CD137 provides a bidirectional inflammatory signal through binding to its ligand 4-1BBL. Both 4-1BB and 4-1BBL have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight-week-old male 4-1BB-deficient and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a regular diet for 9 weeks. RESULTS: We demonstrate that 4-1BB deficiency protects against HFD-induced obesity, glucose intolerance, and fatty liver disease. The 4-1BB-deficient mice fed an HFD showed less body weight gain, adiposity, adipose infiltration of macrophages/T cells, and tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-Î±, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]) compared with HFD-fed control mice. HFD-induced glucose intolerance/insulin resistance and fatty liver were also markedly attenuated in the 4-1BB-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 4-1BB and 4-1BBL may be useful therapeutic targets for combating obesity-induced inflammation and metabolic disorders.
