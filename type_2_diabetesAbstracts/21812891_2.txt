PF-04603629, an exendin-transferrin fusion protein, is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic. This randomized, double-blind study characterized the safety and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of PF-04603629 (n = 57; 1-70 mg) or placebo (n = 14) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There were dose-dependent decreases from baseline in day 6 glucose area under the curve following a mixed meal test (-27 ± 12% with 70 mg). Most treatment-related adverse events were gastrointestinal, with nausea and vomiting most frequent at 70 mg. Pulse rate (PR) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increased dose dependently within the normal range. At 24 h postdose mean PR increased 23 ± 9 bpm and mean DBP increased 10 ± 5 mmHg with 70 mg. In conclusion, PF-04603629 exhibited efficacy and tolerability consistent with its mechanism of action; however, PR and DBP increased. Similar effects have been reported occasionally with other GLP-1 mimetics. These data underscore the importance of careful assessments of haemodynamic effects in GLP-1 analogues.
