 OBJECTIVE: Remogliflozin etabonate (RE), an inhibitor of the sodium-glucose transporter 2, improves glucose profiles in type 2 diabetes. This study assessed safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RE in subjects with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten subjects managed with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion were enrolled. In addition to basal insulin, subjects received five randomized treatments: placebo, prandial insulin, 50 mg RE, 150 mg RE, and mg RE 500. RESULTS: Adverse events and incidence of hypoglycemia with RE did not differ from placebo and prandial insulin groups. RE significantly increased urine glucose excretion and reduced the rise in plasma glucose concentration after oral glucose. RE reduced incremental adjusted weighted mean glucose (0-4 h) values by 42-49 mg/dL and mean glucose (0-10 h) by 52-69 mg/dL. CONCLUSIONS: RE can be safely administered with insulin in type 1 diabetes and reduces plasma glucose concentrations compared with placebo.
