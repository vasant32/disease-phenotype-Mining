 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate twice-daily injections of biphasic insulin lispro vs. basal-bolus (BB) therapy with regard to quality-of-life (QOL) and glycaemic control in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either twice-daily 50/50 premixed insulin lispro (Mix50 group) or BB (NPH insulin at bedtime and preprandial insulin lispro) therapy (BB group) for 12 weeks. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C), 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), blood plasma glucose level, body mass index (BMI), daily total insulin dosage and insulin therapy-related QOL (ITR-QOL) were studied. RESULTS: ITR-QOL was significantly better in the Mix50 than in the BB group (103.1 +/- 9.8 vs. 90.6 +/- 19.4; p < 0.05). HbA(1c) improved in both groups (from 11.1 +/- 2.1 to 6.9 +/- 1.0% with Mix50 vs. from 11.0 +/- 2.3 to 6.6 +/- 0.8% with BB therapy). CONCLUSION: These results might suggest that twice-daily injections of premixed rapid-acting insulin analogue therapy could achieve good glycaemic control and better QOL compared with BB therapy in insulin-naïve type 2 diabetes.
