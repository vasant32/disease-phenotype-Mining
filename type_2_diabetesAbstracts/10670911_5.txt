It is well established that serum total sialic acid (TSA) is elevated in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) compared to non-diabetics. However, it is not clear whether serum TSA is also elevated in type-1 diabetic patients (IDDM). Twenty-one type-1 patients were studied along with age and sex matched normal non-diabetic subjects (ten males and 11 females). Their ages were 24.8+/-3.4 years (20-30) and 23.5+/-3.9 years (18-30) respectively. The duration of diabetes mellitus was 12.6+/-6.7 years (1-24) with a HBA1c of 9.0+/-2.2% (6.0-14.9). There was no significant difference in serum TSA of the type-1 diabetic patients 689+/-107 mg/l versus 670+/-119 mg/l in the normal subjects. Nor was there a significant correlation between serum TSA with patient age (r = -0.31), urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) (r = 0.25), HBA1c (r = 0.36), plasma random glucose (r = -0.04) or diabetes duration (r = -0.09) in the diabetic patients. However, there was a significant correlation between serum TSA and mean daily insulin dose (r = 0.51, P<0.02) and also serum cholesterol and triglyceride (r = 0.58, P<0.01 and r = 0.49, P<0.04, respectively) in the type-1 diabetic patients. In summary, we conclude that serum TSA is not elevated in young type-1 diabetic patients compared with normal age and sex matched control subjects. However, the relationship between serum TSA and serum lipids and also mean daily insulin dose merits further research.
