The offspring of Pima Indians with early onset type 2 diabetes are at high risk for developing diabetes at an early age. This risk is greater among those whose mothers were diabetic during pregnancy. To define the metabolic abnormalities predisposing individuals in these high-risk groups to diabetes, we conducted a series of studies to measure insulin secretion and insulin action in healthy adult Pima Indians. In 104 normal glucose-tolerant subjects, acute insulin secretory response (AIR) to a 25-g intravenous glucose challenge correlated with the age at onset of diabetes in the mother (r = 0.23, P = 0.03) and, in multiple regression analyses, the age at onset of diabetes in the father (P = 0.02), after adjusting for maternal age at onset and after allowing for an interaction between these terms. In contrast, insulin action (hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp) did not correlate with the age at onset of diabetes in the parents. To determine whether early onset diabetes in the parents affected insulin secretion in the offspring across a range of glucose concentrations, responses to a stepped glucose infusion were measured in 23 subjects. Insulin secretion rates were lower in individuals whose mothers had developed diabetes before 35 years of age (n = 8) compared with those whose parents remained nondiabetic until at least 49 years of age (n = 15) (average insulin secretory rates: geometric mean [95% CI] 369 [209-652] vs. 571 [418-780] pmol/min, P = 0.007). Finally, the AIR was lower in individuals whose mothers were diabetic during pregnancy (n = 8) than in those whose mothers developed diabetes at an early age but after the birth of the subject (n = 41) (740 [510-1,310] vs. 1,255 [1,045-1,505] pmol/l, P < 0.02). Thus, insulin secretion is lower in normal glucose tolerant offspring of people with early onset type 2 diabetes. This impairment may be worsened by exposure to a diabetic environment in utero.
