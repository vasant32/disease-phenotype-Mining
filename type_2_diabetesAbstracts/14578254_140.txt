 OBJECTIVE: The oral glucose tolerance test identifies high-risk subjects for diabetes, but it is costly and inconvenient. To find better predictors of type 2 diabetes, we evaluated two different definitions of the metabolic syndrome because insulin resistance, which is commonly associated with this clustering of metabolic factors, frequently precedes the onset of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the ability of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) definition, a modified version of the 1999 World Health Organization (WHO) definition that excludes the 2-h glucose requirement, and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to predict incident type 2 diabetes. In the San Antonio Heart Study, 1734 participants completed a 7- to 8-year follow-up examination. RESULTS: IGT and the NCEP definition had higher sensitivity than the modified WHO definition (51.9, 52.8, and 42.8%, respectively). IGT had a higher positive predictive value than the NCEP and modified WHO definitions (43.0, 30.8, and 30.4%, respectively). The combination of the IGT and NCEP definitions increased the sensitivity to 70.8% with an acceptable positive predictive value of 29.7%. Risk for incidence of type 2 diabetes using the NCEP definition was independent of other risk factors, including IGT and fasting insulin (odds ratio 3.30, 95% CI 2.27-4.80). The NCEP definition performed better with fasting glucose >or=5.4 mmol/l (sensitivity 62.0% and positive predictive value 30.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic syndrome predicts diabetes independently of other factors. However, the NCEP definition performs better than the modified 1999 WHO definition. Lowering the fasting glucose cutoff to 5.4 mmol/l improves the prediction of diabetes by the metabolic syndrome.
