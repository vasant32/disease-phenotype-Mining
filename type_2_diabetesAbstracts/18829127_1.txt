 AIMS: We aimed at determining the associations of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and of angiographically determined coronary artery disease (CAD) with impaired mobility. METHODS: We enrolled 747 consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography for the evaluation of stable CAD. Mobility was assessed by the standardized timed-up-and-go (TUG) test, a functional test of physical performance. RESULTS: Mobility was impaired (TUG time >10s) in 199 (26.6%) patients. The proportion of subjects with impaired mobility was higher among patients with T2DM than among non-diabetic individuals (40.2% vs. 22.0%; p<0.001), whereas it did not differ significantly between patients with significant coronary stenoses >or=50% and those without such lesions (p=0.802). Multivariate adjustment in logistic regression analyses confirmed that T2DM (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.05 [95% CI 1.35-3.11]; p=0.001) but not the presence of significant coronary stenoses (adjusted OR=0.81 [0.55-1.21]; p=0.306) was independently associated with impaired mobility. CONCLUSIONS: T2DM but not coronary atherosclerosis is an independent determinant of impaired mobility in the high risk population of angiographied coronary patients. Mobility enhancing exercise programs are needed for diabetic coronary patients.
