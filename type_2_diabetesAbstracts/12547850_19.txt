 OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of glimepiride, a third-generation sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agent, on insulin resistance in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, in connection with plasma adiponectin and 8-epi-prostagrandin F2alpha (8-epi-PGF2alpha), an oxidative stress marker. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 17 elderly patients with type 2 diabetes received 12 weeks of treatment with glimepiride. Homeostasis assessment model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis assessment model of beta-cell function, HbA(1c), C-peptide in 24-h pooled urine (urine CPR), and plasma concentrations of 8-epi-PGF2alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, and adiponectin were measured at various times. The metabolic clearance rate of glucose (MCR-g) was also assessed by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. RESULTS: After 8 weeks of glimepiride treatment, significant reductions were observed in HbA(1c) (from 8.4 +/- 1.9 to 6.9 +/- 1.0%), HOMA-IR (from 2.54 +/- 2.25 to 1.69 +/- 0.95%), and plasma TNF-alpha concentrations (from 4.0 +/- 2.0 to 2.6 +/- 2.5 pg/ml). MCR-g was significantly increased from 3.92 +/- 1.09 to 5.73 +/- 1.47 mg. kg(-1). min(-1). Plasma adiponectin increased from 6.61 +/- 3.06 to 10.2 +/- 7.14 micro g/ml. In control subjects, who maintained conventional treatment, no significant changes were observed in any of these markers. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride remarkably improved insulin resistance, suggested by a significant reduction in HOMA-IR, an increase in MCR-g, and a reduction in HbA(1c) without changing extrapancreatic beta-cell function and urine CPR. Increased plasma adiponectin and decreased plasma TNF-alpha may underlie the improvement of insulin resistance with glimepiride.
