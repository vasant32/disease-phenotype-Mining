 AIM: Insulin treatment is considered to be the final option for patients with progressive type 2 diabetes. This study investigated, whether reconverting type 2 patients from insulin treatment to oral treatment using pioglitazone is possible without deterioration of blood glucose control. METHODS: The PioSwitch study was a prospective, open label, proof of concept study. Thiazolidinedione-naÃ¯ve patients with residual beta-cell function were switched from an existing insulin therapy to treatment with pioglitazone and glimepiride for 6 months. Efficacy was assessed by laboratory parameters and scores for evaluation of metabolic control, beta-cell function, insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. RESULTS: In total, 98 patients [66 men, 32 women, age (mean +/- s.d.): 59 +/- 9 years; disease duration: 5.6 +/- 3.6 years; Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): 6.9 +/- 0.8%; body mass index (BMI): 33.9 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2), initial daily insulin therapy dose: 0.36 +/- 0.3 U/kg body weight] out of 117 screened patients were treated. During the observation period, 23 patients were prematurely terminated because of an increase in HbA1c from baseline > 0.5% or other reasons. In 75 patients (76%), no deterioration of glucose metabolism occurred and additional improvements were seen in the majority of the observation parameters [baseline vs. endpoint; HbA1c: 6.79 +/- 0.74%/6.66 +/- 0.69% (p < 0.05), glucose: 6.4 +/- 1.5/5.2 +/- 1.4 mmol/l (p < 0.001), adiponectin: 7 +/- 3 mg/l/17 +/- 8 mg/l (p < 0.001), C-peptide: 987 +/- 493/1756 +/- 789 (p < 0.001), sensitivity index derived from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (SI(ivGTT)): 1.21 +/- 0.85/1.49 +/- 0.95 (p < 0.05), hsCRP: 3.3 +/- 2.4/2.6 +/- 2.4 mg/l (p < 0.01), macrophage chemo-attractant protein 1 (MCP1): 487 +/- 246/382 +/- 295 ng/l (p < 0.05)]. BMI increased from 33.8 +/- 5.1 to 34.4 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The switch from insulin therapy resulting in a moderately HbA1c level, to oral treatment with pioglitazone was successful in a majority of patients with sufficient residual beta-cell function. It allows a simple and less expensive therapy with a better cardiovascular risk marker profile.
