AIM: The adipocyte-secreted hormone resistin has been implicated in obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, but pharmacological and dietary factors that regulate resistin gene expression and the effects of resistin on cellular glucose uptake in muscle have not been clearly defined. METHODS: Expression of resistin mRNA was studied in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by using real-time semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The effects of resistin on insulin-stimulated and insulin-independent 2-deoxyglucose uptake were evaluated in L6 muscle cells. RESULTS: Insulin 1 microm and rosiglitazone 10 microm markedly reduced resistin mRNA expression (relative to the control gene TF2D) by 4.7-fold (p < 0.05) and 5.3-fold (p < 0.02), respectively. Similar reductions in resistin mRNA were demonstrated with metformin 100 microm (6.2-fold reduction, p < 0.02) and oleic acid 100 microm (3.9-fold reduction, p < 0.03). Resistin 1 microm significantly reduced maximum insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in L6 cells from 634 to 383% (relative to 100% for control, p < 0.001), and co-administration of rosiglitazone had no effect on resistin-induced insulin resistance. In the absence of insulin, however, resistin increased glucose uptake dose-dependently (e.g., 1.75-fold at 5 microm, p < 0.001) via a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that various glucose-lowering therapies and oleic acid reduce resistin gene expression in isolated adipocytes, and that resistin impairs insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle-derived cells.
