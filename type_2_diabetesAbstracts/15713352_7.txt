 OBJECTIVE: An open randomized prospective study was performed to elucidate the effect of an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, voglibose, on the progression of atherosclerosis in subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Voglibose at a dose of 0.4-0.6 mg/day was added on 51 subjects out of 101 type 2 diabetic patients being treated with diet, sulphonylurea (SU) or insulin injections, and the average (AveIMT) and maximum intima-media thickness (MaxIMT) of their carotid arteries were examined for 3 years. RESULTS: Irrespective of the differences in treatments, addition of voglibose reduced the progression of AveIMT and MaxIMT to -0.024 +/- 0.047 (+/-S.D.) and -0.021 +/- 0.144 mm/year, respectively. Without voglibose, diabetic patients showed significant (P < 0.0001) progression of AveIMT and MaxIMT (0.056 +/- 0.046 and 0.098 +/- 0.122 mm/year, respectively). The administration of voglibose resulted in a significant reduction of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, as well as an increase in HDL cholesterol concentration. Multivariate regression analysis showed that administration of voglibose independently reduced the progression of AveIMT by 0.069 mm/year (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that voglibose reduces the progression of IMT and may be a candidate for an anti-atherosclerotic drug for type 2 diabetic patients.
