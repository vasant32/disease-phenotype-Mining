OBJECTIVE: To compare the overall efficacy of combination therapies focused on fasting or postprandial blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled with oral sulfonylurea agents alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 135 patients were randomly assigned for 3 months to 1 of 3 combination regimens with glyburide (G) that addressed postprandial blood glucose with insulin lispro (L+G), premeal blood glucose with metformin (M+G), or fasting blood glucose (FBG) with bedtime NPH insulin (NPH+G). RESULTS: At end point, HbA1c was significantly lower with all therapies (P = 0.001) and was significantly lower for L+G (7.68+/-0.88%) compared with either NPH+G (8.51+/-1.38%, P = 0.003) or M+G (8.31+/-1.31%, P = 0.025). FBG at end point was significantly lower for NPH+G (8.49+/-2.36 mmol/l) compared with either L+G (10.57+/-1.97 mmol/l, P = 0.001) or M+G (9.69+/-2.89 mmol/l, P = 0.029). The mean 2-h postprandial glucose after a test meal was significantly lower for L+G (10.87+/-2.88 mmol/l) versus NPH+G (12.21+/-3.12 mmol/, P = 0.052) or versus M+G (12.72+/-3.26 mmol/l, P = 0.009). The overall rate of hypoglycemia (episodes per 30 days) was low and not statistically significant between groups (P = 0.156). CONCLUSIONS: Adding a second antihyperglycemic agent, regardless of its timing of action, lowers HbA1c and glucose values. However, when insulin lispro was used to focus on postprandial blood glucose, there was a greater impact on overall metabolic control. These data support the importance of lowering postprandial blood glucose to optimize overall glycemic control and thus improve long-term outcomes.
