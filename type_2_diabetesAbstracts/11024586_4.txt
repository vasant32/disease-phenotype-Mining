While the ethnic make up of the New Zealand population is predominantly European, the Polynesian population, consisting of indigenous New Zealand Maori and more recent immigrants from the other Pacific Islands is increasing rapidly. The prevalence of diabetes in these Polynesians is high. There is also an increasing prevalence of obesity, and obesity is a greater problem amongst Polynesian people. The number of elderly people in the population is increasing. All of these demographic changes are increasing the incidence and prevalence of Type 2 diabetes. The incidence of Type 1 diabetes is also rising, although the reasons for this are unknown. Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of end stage renal failure in New Zealand. Polynesian people with diabetes, and in particular Maori, have a very high rate of diabetic nephropathy and develop renal failure at a more rapid rate than European patients with nephropathy relating to Type 1 diabetes. The propensity for Maori patients with Type 2 diabetes to develop renal failure may relate to a younger age at the onset of diabetes, a genetic susceptibility to nephropathy, and socio-economic or cultural factors leading to less adequate medical care.
