Parameters of haemostasis, endothelial cell markers and lipid peroxide levels were studied in 64 Type 1 (insulin-dependent) and 94 Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients according to their urinary albumin excretion rate in comparison with age-matched control subjects. We determined plasma levels of fibrinogen (Clauss' method), coagulation factor VII:activity (clotting assay), factor VII antigen, protein C and S antigen, von Willebrand factor antigen, D-dimer concentration (ELISA), and lipid peroxide levels (thiobarbituric acid) in relation to urinary albumin excretion rate (RIA). Significant positive correlations were found between urinary albumin excretion rate and plasma fibrinogen (p < 0.005, p < 0.02), factor VII activity (p < 0.0002, p < 0.002), factor VII antigen (p < 0.0001, p < 0.001), protein C (p < 0.003, p < 0.05), and lipid peroxides (p < 0.02, p < 0.004) in Type 1 as well as in Type 2 diabetes. Von Willebrand factor (p < 0.001) and protein S (p < 0.0005) correlated with albuminuria only in patients with Type 1 diabetes. Although most of the haemostatic abnormalities are already found in normoalbuminuric patients, the significant positive correlations to urinary albumin excretion indicate that endothelial cell damage and coagulation disorders deteriorate with the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
