 AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of gliclazide modified release (MR), alone or combined with other oral antidiabetic drug(s) over 2 years in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Two consecutive periods: (i) a 10-month, double-blind comparative study, where 800 type 2 diabetic patients were randomized either to gliclazide MR (30-120 mg) once daily or to gliclazide (80-320 mg) twice daily. All the patients were then treated with gliclazide MR for a 2-month switch period; (ii) 549 patients were subsequently enrolled in a 12-month, open-label period on gliclazide MR alone or in combination according to glycaemic control, 507 of whom completed the study. RESULTS: Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) significantly decreased from baseline over 2 years by -0.46 +/- 1.08% in the whole cohort of 2-year completed patients, -0.95% in the subgroup of diet-failed patients and by -0.34% in the subgroup of patients pretreated with one oral antidiabetic drug. HbA1c was reduced by -0.43 +/- 1.02% and by -0.51 +/- 1.16%, when gliclazide MR was used in monotherapy and in combination therapy, respectively. The overall incidence of symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia was 4.8 episodes/100 patient-year, with no severe episode. This incidence was similarly low in elderly patients and patients with impaired renal function. CONCLUSION: Gliclazide MR alone or in combination with another oral antidiabetic drug significantly improved glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients over 2 years with a very good safety profile, notably in the elderly and in patients with impaired renal function.
