 OBJECTIVE: Despite the popularity of coronary stenting in coronary artery disease (CAD), restenosis remains a challenging clinical problem. This study evaluated the efficacy of rosiglitazone for preventing in-stent restenosis in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, case-controlled trial involving 95 diabetic patients with CAD who were randomly assigned to either the control or rosiglitazone group (48 and 47 patients, respectively). Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was performed at study entry and again at 6-month follow-up. The primary end point was the restenosis rate, which was determined by QCA. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients (45 patients with 55 lesions in the control group and 38 patients with 51 lesions in the rosiglitazone group) completed follow-up angiography. Rosiglitazone treatment for 6 months reduced fasting insulin concentration. The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration was significantly reduced in the rosiglitazone group compared with that in the control group (from 2.92 +/- 1.98 to 0.62 +/- 0.44 mg/l, P < 0.001 vs. from 2.01 +/- 1.33 to 1.79 +/- 1.22 mg/l, P = NS). However, the baseline and follow-up glucose and lipid concentrations were not different between two groups. The rate of in-stent restenosis was significantly reduced in the rosiglitazone group compared with the control group (for stent lesions: 17.6 vs. 38.2%, P = 0.030). The rosiglitazone group had a significantly lower degree of diameter stenosis (23.0 +/- 23.4% vs. 40.9 +/- 31.9%, P = 0.004) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that treatment with rosiglitazone significantly reduces in-stent restenosis in diabetic patients with CAD who underwent coronary stent implantation.
