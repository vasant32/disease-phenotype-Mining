 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Overproduction of phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes (PED, also known as phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes-15 [PEA-15]) is a common feature of type 2 diabetes and impairs insulin action in cultured cells and in mice. Nevertheless, the potential role of PED in diabetic complications is still unknown. METHODS: We studied the effect of PED overproduction and depletion on kidney function in animal and cellular models. RESULTS: Transgenic mice overexpressing PED (PEDTg) featured age-dependent increases of plasma creatinine levels and urinary volume, accompanied by expansion of the mesangial area, compared with wild-type littermates. Serum and kidney levels of TGF-beta1 were also higher in 6- and 9-month-old PEDTg. Overexpression of PED in human kidney 2 cells significantly increased TGF-beta1 levels, SMAD family members (SMAD)2/3 phosphorylation and fibronectin production. Opposite results were obtained following genetic silencing of PED in human kidney 2 cells by antisense oligonucleotides. Inhibition of phospholipase D and protein kinase C-beta by 2-butanol and LY373196 respectively reduced TGF-beta1, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and fibronectin production. Moreover, inhibition of TGF-beta1 receptor activity and SMAD2/3 production by SB431542 and antisense oligonucleotides respectively reduced fibronectin secretion by about 50%. TGF-beta1 circulating levels were significantly reduced in Ped knockout mice and positively correlated with PED content in peripheral blood leucocytes of type 2 diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data indicate that PED regulates fibronectin production via phospholipase D/protein kinase C-beta and TGF-beta1/SMAD pathways in kidney cells. Raised PED levels may therefore contribute to the abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix and renal dysfunction in diabetes.
