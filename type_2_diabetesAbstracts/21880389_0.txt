We estimated the risk-increasing role of late-diagnosis on the onset of complications among 1168 patients representative of above 50 Hungarian diabetic population. Higher occurrence of retinopathy has been found in the late-diagnosis group (OR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.06-2.49). Clinically significant benefit of early-diagnosis was not observable in case of other complications.
