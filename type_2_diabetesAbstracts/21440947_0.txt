This comment on the article: "The association between quality of life, depressive symptoms and glycemic control in a group of type 2 diabetes patients" by Papelbaum et al. was aimed to provide some critical remarks concerning the focus of the results section which showed significant discrepancies compared to the introduction and the research question. In addition, we would like to exhort the authors for a more comprehensive approach and for a more complete and congruent description of their results, in order to avoid misunderstanding.
