 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Although protein is usually ignored when considering insulin resistance, we have shown resistance of protein concurrent with glucose metabolism in men with type 2 diabetes during a hyperinsulinaemic clamp at euglycaemia and fasting aminoacidaemia. We hypothesised that this resistance is even worse during conditions that simulate the postprandial state, when anabolism should be maximal. METHODS: Eight overweight and obese men with type 2 diabetes underwent a hyperinsulinaemic-hyperglycaemic (8 mmol/l) clamp, first with plasma amino acids at postabsorptive (Hyper-2) then at postprandial concentrations (Hyper-3). Whole-body protein kinetics were assessed using L-: [1-(13)C]leucine. Hyper-2 results were compared with those of diabetic men whose plasma glucose was lowered to 5.5 mmol/l and fasting aminoacidaemia maintained during the hyperinsulinaemic clamp (Hyper-1). RESULTS: In Hyper-2 vs Hyper-1 clamps, leucine flux (2.99 ± 0.16 vs 2.62 ± 0.06 μmol kg [fat-free mass (FFM)](-1) min(-1)), rates of synthesis (2.31 ± 0.15 vs 1.98 ± 0.06) and breakdown (2.38 ± 0.16 vs 2.00 ± 0.07) were higher (p < 0.05), but leucine oxidation and net balance did not differ. In Hyper-3 vs Hyper-2 clamps, leucine flux and synthesis and oxidation rates increased markedly as did net balance (0.84 ± 0.09 vs -0.07 ± 0.04 μmol [kg FFM](-1) min(-1), p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In type 2 diabetic men, insulin resistance of protein metabolism is of the same magnitude at 8 vs 5.5 mmol/l, but turnover rates are higher with hyperglycaemia. Contrary to our hypothesis, sustained postprandial-level hyperaminoacidaemia stimulated positive net protein balance comparable with that previously found in lean non-diabetic men. This was sufficient to overcome the insulin resistance of protein anabolism.
