 AIMS: To investigate the relationship of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores with common carotid artery intima media thickness (CCA-IMT), albuminuria and inflammatory factors in type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: 128 asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients, with at least one cardiovascular risk factor in addition to diabetes, were included in the study. CAC scores, carotid arteries plaque formation and CCA-IMT were assessed. The patients were followed for a mean period of 36.6 ± 3.3 months. Linear regression analysis identified the logarithmically transformed (Ln) albuminuria (β=0.32, P=0.007), age (β=0.04, P=0.001) and the uric acid (β=0.13, P=0.04) as independent determinants of the CAC score. During follow-up period, cardiovascular events occurred in 18 out of 46 patients with CAC score ≥100 compared with 5 out of 82 patients with CAC score <100 (log rank, P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis identified LnCAC score (P<0.0001), LnAlbuminuria (P=0.01) and uric acid (P=0.03) as independent predictors for cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant relationship between CAC score, albuminuria and inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes. LnCAC score together with LnAlbuminuria and uric acid were identified as independent predictors of cardiovascular events in these patients.
