AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Several studies have reported that coffee has a protective effect against the development of type 2 diabetes. However, few of these studies used the standard glucose tolerance test to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between coffee and green tea consumption and glucose tolerance status as determined using a 75-g OGTT. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study of 3224 male officials of the self-defence forces. Glucose tolerance status was determined in accordance with the 1998 World Health Organization criteria, and average intakes of coffee and green tea over the previous year were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire. The figures obtained were adjusted for BMI, physical activity and other factors. RESULTS: A total of 1130 men were identified as having glucose intolerance (IFG, IGT or type 2 diabetes). Compared with those who did not consume coffee on a daily basis, fasting and 2-h post-load plasma glucose levels were 1.5% and 4.3% lower in those who drank 5 cups of coffee or more per day respectively. The adjusted odds ratios of glucose intolerance for categories of <1, 1-2, 3-4 and >/=5 cups of coffee per day were 1.0 (referent), 0.8 (95% CI 0.6-1.0), 0.7 (95% CI 0.6-0.9) and 0.7 (95% CI 0.5-0.9) respectively (p=0.0001 for trend). No clear association was observed between green tea drinking and glucose tolerance status. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Coffee consumption may inhibit postprandial hyperglycaemia and thereby protect against the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
