Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has a dual role in modulating insulin sensitivity, with evidence for this cytokine as both an enhancer and inhibitor of insulin action. We determined the effect of IL-6 exposure on glucose and lipid metabolism in cultured myotubes established from people with normal glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. Acute IL-6 exposure increased glycogen synthesis, glucose uptake, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in cultured myotubes from normal glucose tolerant subjects. However, in type 2 diabetic patients, IL-6 was without effect on glucose metabolism and STAT3 signaling, concomitant with increased suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression. IL-6 increased fatty acid oxidation in myotubes from type 2 diabetic and normal glucose tolerant subjects. Expression of IL-6, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), or glycoprotein 130, as well as IL-6 secretion, was unaltered between cultured myotubes from normal glucose tolerant or type 2 diabetic subjects. Circulating serum IL-6 concentration was unaltered between normal glucose tolerant and type 2 diabetic subjects. In summary, skeletal muscle cells from type 2 diabetic patients display selective IL-6 resistance for glucose rather than lipid metabolism. In conclusion, IL-6 appears to play a differential role in regulating metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients compared with normal glucose tolerant subjects.
