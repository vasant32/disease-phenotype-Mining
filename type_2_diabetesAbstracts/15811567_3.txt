 UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to evaluate, whether an educational intervention, focusing on patients' personal understanding of their illness, was more effective than care given according to national guidelines for diabetes care. METHODS: An intervention group (n = 44), with type 2 diabetes was compared with a control group (n = 60), with HbA1c as the primary outcome. The intervention included ten group sessions addressing themes related to the patients' personal understanding of their illness. The diabetes nurses involved were educated in theories about illness/wellness experiences and participated in group sessions where various caring strategies related to the patients' individual needs and understanding were reflected upon. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up the intervention group showed lower HbA1c levels (mean difference 0.94%; P < 0.001), lower triglycerides (mean difference 0.52 mmol/l; P = 0.002) and higher high-density lipoprotein (mean difference 0.15 mmol/l; P = 0.029) and treatment satisfaction than did the control group. The differences remained when adjusting for age, gender, body mass index or changed treatment during the intervention period. Within the intervention group, BMI and treatment satisfaction were also improved. CONCLUSION: The intervention, which focused on patients' personal understanding of illness, was found to be effective in terms of metabolic control and treatment satisfaction.
