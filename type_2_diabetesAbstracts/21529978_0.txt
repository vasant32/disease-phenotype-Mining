We performed a study in 102 people with type 2 diabetes aiming to determine "easy-to-use" predictive factors for glycemic response to glitazones. We found that low baseline HDL-cholesterol (<40 mg/L [1.04 mmol/L] in males, <50 mg/L [1.30 mmol/L] in females) was a strong independent predictor of glycemic response to glitazones (OR=2.67 [2.02-3.52], p=0.0004).
