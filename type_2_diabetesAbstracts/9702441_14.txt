OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of combining electrotherapy with amitriptyline for the management of chronic painful peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 26) with peripheral neuropathy were treated with amitriptyline. After 4 weeks, those patients (n = 23) who failed to respond to amitriptyline or who only had partial relief were randomized between a sham treatment group (control) or an electrotherapy group. Transcutaneous electrotherapy was given for 12 weeks by a portable unit (H-wave machine) that generated a biphasic exponentially decaying waveform (pulse width 4 ms, 25-35 V, > or = 2 Hz). The degree of pain and discomfort was graded on a scale of 0-5. An analog scale was used to record the overall change in symptoms. RESULTS: Amitriptyline produced some degree of symptomatic relief in 15 (60%) of the 26 patients by the 4th week; pain scores decreased from 3.8 +/- 0.1 to 2.9 +/- 0.2 (P < 0.1) and the overall reduction in pain was 26 +/- 5% on an analog scale. In the amitriptyline plus sham treatment group (n = 9), pain scores declined from 2.8 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.5 (P < 0.03) and the overall reduction in pain was 55 +/- 12%, suggesting a procedure-related placebo effect. In the group receiving combined electrotherapy and amitriptyline (n = 14), symptomatic improvement occurred in 12 (85%) patients. Five (36%) of the patients in this group became asymptomatic. Pain scores declined from 3.2 +/- 0.2 to 1.4 +/- 0.4 (P < 0.01) and the overall reduction in pain was 66 +/- 10%. The degree of reduction in pain scores and the incremental relief (above the amitriptyline effect) were significantly greater (P < 0.03) with electrotherapy as compared with sham treatment. The outcomes indicate a substantial beneficial effect of electrotherapy over and above any placebo influence. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical observations suggest that transcutaneous electrotherapy is effective in reducing the pain associated with peripheral neuropathy. This form of therapy may be a useful adjunctive modality when it is combined with a pharmacological agent, such as amitriptyline, to augment symptomatic relief.
