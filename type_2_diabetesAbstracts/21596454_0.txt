 OBJECTIVE: Functional polymorphisms within vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene have shown association with various conditions including diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy. In this study we have performed a candidate gene association study in order to examine VEGF gene polymorphism association with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). METHODS: The study group comprised of type 2 diabetes patients with (N=247) and without (N=241) DFU. Healthy control subjects (N=98) were also recruited from the same area. The ARMS-PCR technique was applied for genotyping of VEGF gene SNPs at positions -7*C/T and -2578*C/A. RESULTS: The frequency of genotype AA was significantly decreased in patients with DFU compared with diabetic subjects without DFU (AA vs CA+CC, p=0.003, OR=0.44, CI=0.24-0.80). Also there was a significant decrease in frequency of A allele in patients with DFU compared to the controls (p=0.02, OR=0.68, CI=0.48-0.96). CONCLUSION: It seems that lower frequency of A allele in patients with DFU is conferring a protective effect which might be as a result of increased angiogenesis in patients carrying this allele.
