The utility and efficacy of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), using single capillary glucose determinations, in the management of non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes has been called into question. The use of continuous sub-cutaneous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems provides an answer for at least some of the inadequacies attributed to point capillary SMBG. The use of CGM adds information on postprandial glucose excursions, nocturnal hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia not previously detected by SMBG. This added information facilitates the tailoring of treatment regimens to the individual patient in order to achieve treatment targets without incurring an increased risk of hypoglycemia and provides a useful tool for patient self-management education.
