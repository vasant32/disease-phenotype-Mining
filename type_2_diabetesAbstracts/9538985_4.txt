OBJECTIVE: To study the fractional esterification rate of cholesterol on HDL particles (FERHDL) in adults with type 2 diabetes and assess its correlation with serum lipids and other coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: FERHDL was measured in 90 adult (57 men, 33 women) patients by an isotopic assay method involving several steps, including preparation of VLDL- and LDL-depleted plasma, labeling of the sample with a trace amount of tritiated cholesterol, separation of free and esterified cholesterol fractions by chromatography post incubation, and subsequent counting of radioactivity in the individual fractions. RESULTS: Male patients have higher FERHDL values than their female counterparts. When HDL cholesterol was controlled for in a multivariate regression analysis, the sex factor was not significant. There was a significant positive correlation between FERHDL and plasma total cholesterol (r = 0.32), triglycerides (r = 0.82), apolipoprotein B (apo B; r = 0.48), insulin (r = 0.46), BMI (r = 0.31), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; r = 0.50). There was a negative correlation between FERHDL and HDL cholesterol (r = -0.76) and apolipoprotein AI (r = -0.60). When both HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were controlled for, the only significant correlation was between FERHDL and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Non-insulin-requiring type 2 diabetic patients have FERHDL, which correlated positively with triglycerides and negatively with HDL cholesterol. The positive correlation of FERHDL with serum insulin, WHR, total cholesterol, and apo B, but not that with BMI, loses its significance when HDL cholesterol and triglycerides are controlled. The sex difference between men and women in FERHDL also loses its significance when HDL cholesterol is controlled.
