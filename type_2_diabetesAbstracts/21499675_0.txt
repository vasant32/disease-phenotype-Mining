 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Severe hypoglycaemia associated with diabetes management is a potential risk for cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect and mechanism of hypoglycaemia on the progression of atherosclerosis remains largely unknown. As a first step towards elucidating the above, we investigated the effect of hypoglycaemia on monocyte-endothelial interaction. METHODS: Insulin was injected intraperitoneally once every 3 days for 5 weeks in Goto-Kakizaki rats, a non-obese rat model of type 2 diabetes. We counted the number of monocytes adherent to the endothelium of thoracic aorta as an index of early atherosclerogenesis. Cultured HUVEC were used to investigate the mechanism of action. RESULTS: Insulin treatment increased the number of monocytes adherent to the vascular endothelium. This increase was abrogated by injection of glucose with insulin. Amosulalol, an α-1 and β-adrenoreceptor antagonist, suppressed monocyte adhesion to endothelium and levels of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) in the endothelial surface, which had been enhanced by insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. In HUVEC, adrenaline (epinephrine) significantly increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 and levels of adhesion molecules, effects that were abrogated following addition of SQ22536, a specific adenyl cyclase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data indicate that repetitive hypoglycaemia induced by insulin enhanced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in Goto-Kakizaki rat aorta through enhanced adrenaline activity and that the latter stimulated intracellular cAMP, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB with subsequent production of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells.
