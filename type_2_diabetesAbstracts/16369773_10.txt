AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to: (1) define the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and IFG in Eskimos in Norton Sound, Alaska; (2) determine correlates of prevalent diabetes in this population; and (3) compare the prevalence of diabetes in the Genetics of Coronary Artery Disease in Alaska Natives (GOCADAN) Study with other samples of Eskimos, Inuit, American Indians and US blacks, whites and Mexican Americans. METHODS: The GOCADAN Study enrolled 1,214 participants >or=18 years who were members of extended pedigrees from the Norton Sound region of Alaska. Diagnosed type 2 diabetes was based on reported use of insulin or hypoglycaemic medications and a medication inventory. Fasting glucose measurements were obtained to ascertain IFG status and undiagnosed diabetes according to American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. OGTTs were performed to ascertain diabetes according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition. We used logistic regression analysis to model factors that were significantly associated with odds of prevalent ADA diabetes. RESULTS: The prevalences of ADA diabetes and IFG were 3.8% (5.0% of women; 2.2% of men) and 15.6% (13.9% of women; 17.7% of men), respectively. In the subset of 787 participants who took the OGTT, the prevalences of ADA and WHO diabetes were 5.1 and 6.9%, respectively. The adjusted odds of ADA diabetes was 2.8 times higher in participants meeting Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for abdominal obesity than in those who did not. The statistically significant sex-related difference in diabetes prevalence did not persist in multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Alaska Eskimos have a low prevalence of type 2 diabetes. The high prevalence of IFG indicates that diabetes may become increasingly problematic in this population. Abdominal obesity in women may help explain why diabetes prevalence differs according to sex.
