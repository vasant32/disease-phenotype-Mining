Although cross-sectional studies have associated the Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPARG with type 2 diabetes, prospective studies offer more opportunities to investigate genetic variants. Associations between PPARG polymorphisms with insulin resistance parameters and with the 6-year incidence of impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes were tested in 3,914 French Caucasians from the DESIR (Data From an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome) cohort. In subjects normoglycemic at baseline (n = 3,498), the 6-year risk of hyperglycemia was lower in PPARG Ala carriers (odds ratio [OR] vs. ProPro = 0.66 [95% CI 0.44-0.99], P = 0.046 adjusted for sex, age, and BMI). Similar results were found with the PPARG C1431T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; adjusted OR = 0.65 [0.44-0.96], P = 0.036). Both alleles are in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.669, P < 0.001). The baseline mean fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were lower in Ala carriers compared with ProPro homozygotes (P = 0.001 for both), with smaller increases in mean insulin and HOMA-IR during follow-up (P = 0.007 and 0.018, respectively). No association with insulin levels or HOMA-IR was found with C1431T. In this cohort, the APM1 G-11391A SNP is associated with the development of hyperglycemia. The combined effects of PPARG Pro12Ala and APM1 G-11391A SNPs showed no interaction on the risk of 6-year hyperglycemia. The PPARG Ala allele showed a relatively high protective effect in developing hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia during a 6-year period. Cumulative rather than synergistic effects of PPARG Pro12Ala and APM1 SNPs on diabetes risk are suggested.
