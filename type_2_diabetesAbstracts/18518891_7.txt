Patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome remain at high residual risk of cardiovascular events even after intensive statin therapy. While treatment guidelines recommend the addition of a fibrate to statin therapy in this setting, concerns about the potential for myopathy may limit the use of this combination in clinical practice. These concerns are certainly justified for gemfibrozil, which interferes with statin glucuronidation, leading to elevation in statin plasma concentrations and an increased risk of myotoxicity in combination with a range of commonly prescribed statins. However, the available evidence refutes suggestions that this is a class effect for fibrates. Fenofibrate does not adversely influence the metabolism or pharmacokinetics of any of the commonly prescribed statins. This in turn translates to a reduced potential for myotoxicity in combination with a statin. Data are awaited from the ongoing Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate plus simvastatin combination therapy in type 2 diabetes patients.
