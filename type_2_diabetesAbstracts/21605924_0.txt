The world is facing an epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, with populations in low- to middle-income countries, including many in the Asia Pacific (AP) region, being disproportionately affected. Emerging data identify postprandial hyperglycaemia (PPHG) as an important predictor of CVD, and several professional bodies, including the International Diabetes Federation, have issued guidelines on the management of PPHG in type 2 diabetes. Guidance on how international recommendations could be implemented in Asian populations is currently lacking. Therefore, a panel of experts from the AP region convened to consider the current status of PPHG and CVD in the region, and to develop recommendations for clinical practice. The group concluded that improved awareness of the impact of PPHG on CVD risk, among clinicians and the general public, and more widespread use of routine screening for PPHG, using oral glucose tolerance testing in those without recognised diabetes, are required. Additionally, frequent meal-based testing and effective PPHG management are essential to the management of IGT and type 2 diabetes.
