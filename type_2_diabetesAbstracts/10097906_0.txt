Painful sensory syndromes and the anesthetic foot result in much clinical morbidity and patient unhappiness in diabetes. As yet, a satisfactory and fundamental therapy is not available to us to help patients. Effective blood glucose control and vigilant screening programs for foot problems are all we have to offer. Clinical observation of neuropathic syndromes and measures of nerve function have not led to significant understanding of pathogenesis. The primary source of understanding of pathways to nerve damage come from animal studies, despite the fears that the model in diabetes in no way reflects the human situation. Therapeutic hope at the moment from such animal work must focus on the interference of pathways known to lead to neural blood-flow abnormalities and a variety of metabolic abnormalities, as well as the possibility that addition of nerve growth factor will assist repair and regeneration. The understanding of these multiple pathways in the animal model underlines the likely enormous complexity in the final picture of understanding in diabetic neuropathy. Modern imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging should, in the future, allow more significant investigation of the human subject.
