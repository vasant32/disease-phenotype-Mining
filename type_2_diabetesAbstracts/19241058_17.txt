 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The GCKR rs780094 and GCK rs1799884 polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with dyslipidaemia and type 2 diabetes in white Europeans. The aim of this study was to replicate these associations in Han Chinese individuals and to identify the potential mechanisms underlying these associations. METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms rs780094 and rs1799884 were genotyped in a population-based sample of Han Chinese individuals (n = 3,210) and tested for association with risk of type 2 diabetes and related phenotypes. RESULTS: The GCKR rs780094 A allele was marginally associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73-1.00, p value under an additive model [p((add))] = 0.05) and significantly associated with reduced risk of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or type 2 diabetes (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.96, p([add]) = 0.0032). It was also significantly associated with decreased fasting glucose and increased HOMA of beta cell function (HOMA-B) and fasting triacylglycerol levels (p([add]) = 0.0169-5.3 x 10(-6)), but not with HOMA of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S). The associations with type 2 diabetes and IFG remained significant after adjustment for BMI, while adjustment for HOMA-B abolished the associations. The GCKR rs780094 was also associated with obesity and BMI, independently of its association with type 2 diabetes. The GCK rs1799884 A allele was significantly associated with decreased HOMA-B (p([add]) = 0.0005), but not with type 2 diabetes or IFG. Individuals with increasing numbers of risk alleles for both variants had significantly lower HOMA-B (p([add]) = 5.8 x 10(-5)) in the combined analysis. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Consistent with observations in white Europeans, the GCKR rs780094 polymorphism contributes to the risk of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia in Han Chinese individuals. In addition, we showed that the effect on type 2 diabetes is probably mediated through impaired beta cell function rather than through obesity.
