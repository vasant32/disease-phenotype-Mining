The incretin based therapies are an emerging class of antidiabetic drugs, with two categories: one is glucagone like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and the other one is dipeptidyl peptidase (CD26; DPP-IV) inhibitors. However, in the DPP-IV inhibitors category only few compounds are commercially available and also have some undesirable effects. Therefore, in the present work we tried to explore a naturally occurring compound naringin for its potential DPP-IV inhibition and antidiabetic potential. It is noteworthy that this compound is abundantly present in orange peel and thus may provide cost effective treatment for diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we have conducted virtual docking study and observed tight binding of naringin, as shown by higher negative values of H bond lengths, while in vitro DPP-IV inhibition assay has also shown better inhibition by naringin. In vivo study, in response to 10 days administration of 40 mg/kg of naringin twice daily to Wistar albino rats, inhibited the serum levels of DPP-IV activity, random glucose concentration with concomitant increase in insulin levels. All the comparisons were made with the standard commercially available drug sitagliptin.
