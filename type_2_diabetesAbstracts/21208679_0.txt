 OBJECTIVE: To study the association of low serum creatinine, abnormal lipid profile and demographic variables with type 2 diabetic Trinidadian subjects. METHODS: Data were obtained from a cohort of 1122 diabetic and non-diabetic patients from clinics in Trinidad. Variables measured included demographics, HbA1(c), serum creatinine, lipid profile values and diabetic status. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 476 males (61.6% diabetic) and 646 females (50.3% diabetic). Most patients (59.2%) were Indo-Trinidadian, 23.4% were Afro-Trinidadian and 13.5% were of 'mixed' and 'other' categories. The majority (55.1%) of the patients were diabetic and diabetics were older than non-diabetics (p=0.000). Abnormal lipid profile OR=0.728, CI (0.532, 0.994), serum creatinine categories OR=1.520, CI (1.317, 1.754), gender OR=0.690, CI (0.533, 0.892) and age groups OR=1.305, CI (1.185, 1.437) were useful predictors of type 2 diabetes. Ethnicity was not a useful predictor: OR=1.007, CI (0.869, 1.168). Serum creatinine (mean) was found to be lower in diabetics aged 21-50 than in their non-diabetic counterparts. However, above 50 years old, the reverse was true. Serum creatinine means were higher in males than in females (p=0.000). CONCLUSION: Abnormal lipid profile, gender, age and serum creatinine are associated with type 2 diabetes. While age and gender are non-modifiable risk factors, steps should be taken to monitor and control the serum creatinine and lipid profile values of diabetics and non-diabetics.
