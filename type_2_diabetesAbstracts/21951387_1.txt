Weight-reducing surgical procedures such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) have proven efficient as means of decreasing excess body weight. Furthermore, some studies report that up to 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) undergoing RYGB experience complete remission of their T2DM. Interestingly, the majority of remissions occur almost immediately following the operation and long before significant weight loss has taken place. Following RYGB, dramatic increases in postprandial plasma concentrations of the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) have been recorded, and the known antidiabetic effects of GLP-1 are thought to be key mediators in RYGB-induced remission of T2DM. However, the published studies on the impact of RYGB on GLP-1 secretion are few, small and often not controlled properly. Furthermore, mechanistic studies delineating the role of endogenous GLP-1 secretion in RYGB-induced remission of T2DM are lacking. This article critically evaluates the current evidence for a role of GLP-1 in RYGB-induced remission of T2DM.
