BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study assessed the glucose-lowering effects of monotherapy with the glucokinase activator AZD1656 in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study performed in Japan (NCT01152385). Patients (n = 224) were randomized to AZD1656 (40-200, 20-140 or 10-80 mg titrated doses) or placebo. The primary variable was the placebo-corrected change from baseline to 4 months in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c ). Effects on fasting plasma glucose and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: HbA1c was reduced numerically from baseline by 0.3-0.8% with AZD1656 and by 0.1% with placebo over the first 2 months of treatment, after which effects of AZD1656 started to decline. The changes from baseline to 4 months in HbA1c were not significant for the AZD1656 40-200 mg group vs. placebo (mean [95% CI] placebo-corrected change: -0.22 [-0.65, 0.20] %; p = 0.30). Formal significance testing was not carried out for the other two AZD1656 dose groups. A higher percentage of patients on AZD1656 achieved HbA1c ≤7% after 4 months versus placebo, but responder rates were low. Results for fasting plasma glucose reflected those for HbA1c . Cases of hypoglycaemia were rare with AZD1656 (one patient) and no safety concerns were raised. CONCLUSIONS: Although initially favourable plasma glucose reductions were observed, there was a loss of effect over time with sustained AZD1656 treatment. The study design did not allow an evaluation of the reasons for this lack of long-term efficacy.
