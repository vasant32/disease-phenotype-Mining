Amelioration of albuminuria may be related to specific constellations of risk factors including race and dyslipidaemia. Circulating cholesterol could mitigate the beneficial effect of antihypertensive therapy. We assessed whether cholesterol affected the remission of urinary albumin in patients with type 2 diabetes of white, Caucasian and non-white origin. We studied 100 patients (African and Asian: n=57 and Caucasian: n=43) with type 2 diabetes and newly diagnosed microalbuminuria who received intensified and structured care for a median (IQ range) of 41 (32-48) months. Microalbuminuria remitted in 20% and progressed in 12% of patients. In those with uncontrolled systolic hypertension (>140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure fell by a mean (95% CI) of -9.4 (-3.8 to -15.11)mmHg; p=0.002. The change in urinary albumin excretion with time varied inversely with baseline systolic blood pressure (r=-0.25; p=0.04). At 3 years follow-up the decrement in blood pressure was significant for those patients in the regression group (-19.6[16.8]mmHg; p=0.005). In patients of African origin, systolic blood pressure was higher than in the other groups and correlated with cholesterol concentrations (r=0.44; p=0.04). Baseline systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol (odds ratio [95%CI]) were independent determinants of remission and progression of microalbuminuria (1.04[1.006-1.064]; p=0.02 and 1.75[1.03-2.95]; p=0.04). Patients with higher total cholesterol and baseline urinary albumin excretion were less likely to go into remission. Blood pressure correlated with cholesterol concentrations in patients of African origin. Specific cholesterol lowering strategies may benefit certain patients groups at high risk of renal disease.
