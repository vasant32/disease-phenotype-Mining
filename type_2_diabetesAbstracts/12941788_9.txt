The SLC2A10 gene encodes the GLUT10 facilitative glucose transporter, which is expressed in high amounts in liver and pancreas. The gene is mapped to chromosome 20q12-q13.1, a region that has been shown to be linked to type 2 diabetes. The gene was examined in 61 Danish type 2 diabetic patients, and a total of six variants (-27C-->T, Ala206Thr, Ala272Ala, IVS2 + 10G-->A, IVS4 + 18T-->G, and IVS4 + 26G-->A) were identified and investigated in an association study, which included 503 type 2 diabetic patients and 510 glucose-tolerant control subjects. None of the variants were associated with type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, carriers of the codon 206 Thr allele had 18% lower fasting serum insulin levels (P = 0.002) and 20% lower insulinogenic index (P = 0.03) than homozygous carriers of the Ala allele. These results suggest that variation in the coding region of SLC2A10 does not contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in the examined study population. However, the codon 206 polymorphism may be related to the interindividual variation in fasting and oral glucose-induced serum insulin levels.
