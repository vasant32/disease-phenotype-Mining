The ORP150 gene that encodes the human oxygen-regulated protein (150 kDa) maps to chromosome 11q23, a region previously reported to be linked to type 2 diabetes and obesity in Pima Indians. This gene was also found to be differentially expressed in global gene expression studies comparing muscle mRNA from insulin-resistant versus insulin-sensitive subjects. Therefore, ORP150 was analyzed as a candidate gene for susceptibility to diabetes. Twelve variants were identified, and three unique representative polymorphisms were genotyped in 1,338 Pima Indians. None of these polymorphisms were associated with diabetes, but two polymorphisms were significantly associated with measures of insulin resistance. These data indicate that ORP150 has a role in insulin action but does not have a major role in determining susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians.
