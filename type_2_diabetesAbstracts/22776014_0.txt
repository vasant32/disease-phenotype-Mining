 AIM: To assess blood glucose control over 24 h and the safety of teneligliptin 10 and 20 mg, a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with diet and exercise. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients were administered teneligliptin 10 or 20 mg or placebo before breakfast for 4 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. RESULTS: Both teneligliptin-treated groups showed significantly smaller 2-h postprandial glucose (2-h PPG), 24-h mean glucose and fasting plasma glucose values than the placebo group. The differences between the teneligliptin 10 mg and placebo groups in changes in 2-h PPG after each meal were -50.7 ± 7.8, -34.8 ± 9.2 and -37.5 ± 7.5 mg/dl at breakfast, lunch and dinner, respectively [least-squares (LS) means ± standard error (s.e.), all, p < 0.001]. The corresponding LS means ± s.e. for teneligliptin 20 mg versus placebo were -38.1 ± 7.8, -28.6 ± 9.2 and -36.1 ± 7.5 mg/dl, respectively (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively). Both doses of teneligliptin increased postprandial plasma active glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations compared with placebo. The incidence of adverse events and drug-related adverse events was similar among groups. There were no hypoglycaemic symptoms or serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily teneligliptin improved blood glucose levels over 24 h without hypoglycaemia.
