 AIMS: Diabetic nephropathy is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The underlying etiology is not fully understood but may be related to changes in inflammatory and hemostatic markers with kidney disease. We investigated the associations of the markers with microvascular complications in Pima Indians (PI) with early-onset type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: C-reactive protein, interleukine-6, fibrinogen, D-dimer, plasmin-antiplasmin complex and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were measured in 104 PI (age: 32+/-4 y) with diabetes and 59 (32+/-4 y) with fasting glucose <110 mg/dl and 2-h glucose <140 mg/dl. Urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) was used as marker of nephropathy. Severity of retinopathy was classified in the worse eye by direct ophthalmoscopy as none, background and proliferative. RESULTS: Of these markers, only fibrinogen was associated with ACR (r=0.25, p<0.01). After adjustment for age, sex, percentage Pima heritage, smoking status, diabetes duration, blood pressure and use of aspirin, antihypertensive and antihyperglycemic agents, general linear models (with natural log-transformed values of fibrinogen and ACR as dependent and independent variables, respectively) revealed that a one percent increase in ACR would yield a 0.02% increase in the fibrinogen (beta=0.02, p<0.05). Plasma fibrinogen was also significantly increased with severity of diabetic retinopathy (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Increased plasma fibrinogen concentration was associated with diabetic microvascular disease, in particular with nephropathy. This may help to explain the etiologic link between nephropathy and CVD.
