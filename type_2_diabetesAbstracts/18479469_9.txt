 AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and treatment satisfaction with biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp30) in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The Physicians' Routine Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy of NovoMix 0 Therapy Korea study was a 6-month, prospective, observational study. No study-specific interventions were involved except the collection of data. All patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on their previous therapy, and who were prescribed BIAsp30 as monotherapy, or in combination with oral hypoglycaemic agents, were eligible for the study. This subgroup analysis was based on the outcomes in patients > or years (n = 1720). RESULTS: BIAsp30 treatment was associated with significant mean reductions in haemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose and post-prandial plasma glucose levels of 1.2 +/- 1.6%, 2.3 +/- 3.5 mmol/l and 4.8 +/- 5.3 mmol/l at 6 months (p < 0.0001 for all), from baseline levels of 9.1 +/- 1.7%, 10.7 +/- 3.4 mmol/l and 16.7 +/- 5.0 mmol/l, respectively. The rate of hypoglycaemia declined from 3.02 to 1.31 episodes per patient year, between baseline and study end. The proportion of patients reporting adverse drug reactions was low (0.3 and 0.1% at 3 and 6 months, respectively). Body weight gain was mild at <0.1 kg at 3 months, and 0.3 kg at 6 months. As compared to the previous treatment, >80% of patients were rated as being either 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with BIAsp30 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In this subanalysis of Korean elderly patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on their previous therapies, treatment with BIAsp30 offered improvements in glycaemic control and was well tolerated. Body weight gain was minimal with BIAsp30, and treatment satisfaction among these patients appeared to be high.
