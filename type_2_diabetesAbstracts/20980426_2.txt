 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an exercise program organized into supervised walking groups in subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-nine diabetic subjects were randomized to a control group receiving standard lifestyle recommendations or an intervention group assigned to three supervised walking sessions per week and counseling. Changes in metabolic features, weight, 6-min walk test, prescription of antidiabetic medications, and overall physical activity were assessed. RESULTS: Functional capacity and overall physical activity were higher in the intervention group, whereas metabolic changes were not different between groups after 4 months. However, in subjects who attended at least 50% of scheduled walking sessions, changes in A1C and fasting glucose were greater than in control subjects. Discontinuation or reduction of antidiabetic drugs occurred in 33% of these patients versus 5% of control subjects (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Supervised walking may be beneficial in diabetic subjects, but metabolic improvement requires adequate compliance.
