 AIMS: Screening for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may improve long-term outcomes by managing cardiovascular risk at an earlier stage of the disease. The cardiovascular risk profile of screen-detected (SD) T2DM is ill defined and has not been compared to conventional newly diagnosed (CD) cases. METHODS: Baseline data from SD (n=337) and CD (n=824) cohorts were compared. SD adopted mixed approaches to screening, population based (n=214) and cardiovascular-risk factor targeted (n=123). CD reflected UK primary care practice with cases referred within four weeks of diagnosis. RESULTS: People with SD T2DM were leaner, had a lower HbA1c(%) and lower triglyceride but were more hypertensive compared to people with CD T2DM. Fewer SD were on blood pressure lowering (46% vs. 60%, p<0.0001), statin (30% vs. 41%, p<0.0001) or anti-platelet (15% vs. 27%, p<0.0001) therapies. Modelled 10 year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was actually greater in the SD group compared to CD (CVD: 20.8 vs. 17.2, p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Individuals with SD T2DM are at high risk of CVD as a result of untreated hyperglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Those prescribed antihypertensive or lipid-lowering therapies frequently still had inadequate control. Identifying vascular risk by screening for latent glucose disease provides therapeutic opportunities for earlier intervention.
