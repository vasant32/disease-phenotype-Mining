 AIMS/HYPOTHESES: Chronic hyperglycaemia increases dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) activity in endothelial cells in vitro. The present study was designed to assess the effect of high glucose on circulating DPP-IV activity in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Plasma DPP-IV activity was measured in 29 patients with type 1 diabetes and 29 age-, sex- and BMI-matched control subjects. We also assessed DPP-IV activity in 31 type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c > 8.5% and in plasma from matched groups of 31 newly diagnosed diabetic subjects with HbA1c < 7.5%, 31 subjects with IGT and 62 subjects with NGT. In a further sample of 66 type 2 diabetic patients, a longitudinal study was also performed to evaluate variations in DPP-IV activity and HbA1c over 3 months. RESULTS: DPP-IV activity in type 1 diabetic patients was not significantly different from that in control subjects; however, a significant correlation between DPP-IV and HbA1c was observed in diabetic subjects (r = 0.47; p < 0.01). Type 2 diabetic patients with HbA1c > 8.5% showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher DPP-IV activity (mean+/-SD 27.7+/-7.1 U/l) than newly diagnosed diabetic patients and subjects with IGT (22.1+/-6.0 and 18.8+/-8.8 U/l, respectively). Variations in DPP-IV activity over 3 months in type 2 diabetic patients showed a significant positive correlation with variations in HbA1c (r = 0.26; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Chronic hyperglycaemia induces a significant increase in DPP-IV activity in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This phenomenon could contribute to the reduction in circulating active glucagon-like peptide-1 and to the consequent postprandial hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients with poor metabolic control.
