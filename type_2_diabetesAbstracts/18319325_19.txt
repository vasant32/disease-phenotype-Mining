 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and mortality in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 1998, 1,143 primary care patients with type 2 diabetes participated in the Zwolle Outpatient Diabetes project Integrating Available Care (ZODIAC) study. At baseline, HRQOL was assessed with the RAND-36 and, after almost 6 years, life status was retrieved. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to investigate the association between HRQOL (continuous data) and mortality with adjustment for selected confounders (smoking, age, sex, diabetes duration, A1C, renal function, BMI, blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, and macrovascular complications). RESULTS: The Physical Component Summary of the RAND-36 was inversely associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.979 [95% CI 0.966-0.992]), as were two separate RAND-36 dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that HRQOL is an independent marker of mortality and emphasizes the importance of looking beyond clinical parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes.
