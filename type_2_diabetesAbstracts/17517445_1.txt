This study measured patient views about following tablet-taking and food-timing recommendations in Type 2 diabetes. Two new questionnaires were validated. Outpatients with Type 2 diabetes treated with sulphonylurea agents (n=131) completed the seven-item Diabetes Tablet Treatment Questionnaire (DTTQ) and nine-item Diabetes Food Timing Questionnaire (DFTQ). Mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.8% (S.D. 1.8%). At least 74% had optimal DTTQ item scores for tablet-taking as recommended, difficulty taking tablets, side effects, perceived hypoglycaemia and willingness to continue current tablets, but 71% scored sub-optimally regarding recent hyperglycaemia. Under half scored optimally on DFTQ items concerning eating at recommended times, difficulty with food-timing, denying oneself food and guilt about eating. Principal components and reliability analyses identified a two-item tablet problem scale within the DTTQ (alpha 0.72) and a seven-item food-timing problem scale in the DFTQ (alpha 0.77). Satisfaction and adherence were not closely related to glycaemic control. Only scores for perceived hyperglycaemia (r=0.38), perceived hypoglycaemia (r=-0.24) and satisfaction to continue current tablets (r=-0.20) correlated significantly with HbA1c. Clinicians found that the DTTQ helped to raise tablet-taking issues otherwise missed in consultations. Both questionnaires can be used to guide the need for focussed discussion, educational intervention and/or treatment change and to evaluate their impact.
