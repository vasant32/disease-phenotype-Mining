The prevalence of diabetes is increasing globally and is expected to increase to 439 million people by the year 2030. Several studies have shown that improved glycemic control measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes results in a reduction of both the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. The recent introduction of new oral medications, insulin analogs (long and rapid acting), insulin pens and pumps, better SMBG meters and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) have all resulted in improvement of glycemic control. Closed-loop devices currently in development aim to integrate the CGM and pump system in order to more closely mimic the human pancreas. The other upcoming new basal insulin (Degludec), prandial insulin, other new technologies and improved oral therapies will significantly improve patient acceptance of intensive therapy, glycemic control and quality of life in patients with diabetes.
