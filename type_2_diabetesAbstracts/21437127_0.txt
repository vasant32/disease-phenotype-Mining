Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist approved for use in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In clinical trials, significant reductions in serum glucose and weight were demonstrated for exenatide with primary glycemic effects of the twice daily formulation on prandial glucose control. In this paper, we review recent research with exenatide as adjunctive therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In particular, studies demonstrate ongoing benefit on glycemic control and weight reduction with continued therapy up to 82 weeks duration and efficacy as adjunctive therapy for patients taking metformin, thiazolidinediones, and/or a sulfonylurea and as compared to sitagliptin and various insulin formulations. Compared to insulin, exenatide likely has greatest benefit for those patients who are overweight or who need improved prandial glucose control. The new long-acting release formulation of exenatide has demonstrated slightly improved efficacy compared to the twice daily formulation as well as a reduction in gastrointestinal side effects. Emerging research is further exploring novel benefits of exenatide as adjunctive DM therapy, effects on prandial glycemic control, markers of hepatic inflammation, alternative dosage forms including intra-nasal administration, and effects on beta cell function.
