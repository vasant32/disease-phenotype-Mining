Plasma N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) is released in response to pressure overload, intravascular volume expansion and myocardial ischemia from cardiac ventricles. We studied the relationship between NT-proBNP levels and left ventricular dysfunction and urinary albumin excretion in Type 2 diabetes. The study group consisted of 130 diabetic patients referred for echocardiography. They were divided into four groups according to echocardiographic finding and into three groups according to urinary albumin excretion. NT-proBNP levels were measured by electrochemiluminescence. There were significant differences in NT-proBNP levels among four groups (P=0.012), with a highly significant difference between normal and other groups with left ventricular dysfunction. NT-proBNP levels in diastolic dysfunction were significantly higher than normal group (1491.1 pg/mL versus 232.3 pg/mL, P=0.01), even though there was no difference in ejection fraction (EF) (61.2+/-7.9% versus 60+/-8.4%, P=0.773). NT-proBNP levels showed positive correlation with age (Rs=0.37, P<0.001), creatinine (Rs=0.38, P=0.001), LVIDS (Rs=0.56, P=0.001) and LVIDD (Rs=0.34, P=0.04) and negative correlation with EF (Rs=-0.66, P=0.001). NT-proBNP levels significantly differed among three groups according to urinary albumin excretion (P=0.031). These results suggest that NT-proBNP could be used to identify any impairment of left ventricular function in diabetes.
