OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype on baseline lipid levels and the response to hydroxy-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) therapy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We consecutively recruited Chinese patients with type 2 DM requiring lipid-lowering therapy according to current guidelines. Patients were started on either simvastatin 10 mg daily or given an equivalent dose of lovastatin 20 mg. After 12 weeks of statin therapy, patients had fasting lipid profiles repeated. ApoE genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were studied. The epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype was in 62.5%, epsilon2/epsilon3 and epsilon3/epsilon4, 16.7 and 20.8%, respectively. After adjusting for confounding variables, baseline total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were significantly higher in those with epsilon3/epsilon4 compared with epsilon2/epsilon3 genotype (6.7 vs. 5.5 mm for TC, 4.5 vs. 3.6 mm for LDL-C; p = 0.015 and p = 0.025, respectively). With statin therapy, epsilon3/epsilon4 patients had significantly greater LDL-C lowering compared with epsilon2/epsilon3 patients (48 vs. 27.7%; p = 0.04). There was no gender difference in baseline lipid parameters or response to statin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: ApoE genotype accounts for interindividual variability of baseline cholesterol levels, and response to statin therapy in Chinese patients with type 2 DM.
