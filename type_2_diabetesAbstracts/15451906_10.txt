 OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cardiac autonomic activity, particularly sympathovagal balance as estimated by power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variation (HRV), is associated with serum adiponectin concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 105 patients with type 2 diabetes (51 women and 54 men). Serum adiponectin concentrations were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HRV was determined automatically every 5 min over 24 h using Holter electrocardiographic recording. PSA of R-R intervals was performed using fast Fourier transformation. Low-frequency (both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities), high- frequency (pure parasympathetic activity), and the ratio of low-frequency-to-high-frequency power (LF-to-HF ratio), an index of sympathovagal balance, were used as indexes of cardiac autonomic activity. RESULTS: We found no significant correlation between serum adiponectin and low-frequency or high-frequency power in patients with diabetes. Serum adiponectin concentration correlated negatively with the 24-h LF-to-HF ratio (r = -0.343, P = 0.0009) and creatinine clearance (r = -0.411, P < 0.0001). Serum adiponectin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with overt albuminuria than in those with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria. In multivariate analysis controlling for sex, BMI, glycemic control, lipid profile, and renal function, serum adiponectin concentration showed an independent negative association with 24-h LF-to-HF ratio (beta = -0.332, P = 0.020). Furthermore, sex, HDL cholesterol, and renal function retained significant influence on the serum adiponectin concentration in patients with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Sympathovagal balance favoring relative sympathetic activation was associated with low serum concentrations of adiponectin in patients with type 2 diabetes.
