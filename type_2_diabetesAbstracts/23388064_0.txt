AIM: The incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and cholecystokinin (CCK) are gastrointestinal peptides with important physiological effects. However, rapid enzymatic degradation results in short-lived biological actions. METHODS: This study has examined metabolic actions of exendin-4, GIP[mPEG] and a novel CCK-8 analogue, (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 as enzymatically stable forms of GLP-1, GIP and CCK, respectively. RESULTS: All peptides significantly (p < 0.01-p < 0.001) stimulated insulin secretion from BRIN BD11 cells, and acute in vivo experiments confirmed prominent antihyperglycaemic and insulinotropic responses to GLP-1 or GIP receptor activation in normal mice. Twice daily injection of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 alone and in combination with exendin-4 or GIP[mPEG] in high fat-fed mice significantly decreased accumulated food intake (p < 0.05-p < 0.01), body weight gain (p < 0.05-p < 0.01) and improved (p < 0.05) insulin sensitivity in high fat-fed mice. However, there was no evidence for superior effects compared to (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 alone. Combined treatment of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 and exendin-4 resulted in significantly (p < 0.05) lowered circulating glucose levels and improved (p < 0.05) intraperitoneal glucose tolerance. These effects were superior to either treatment regime alone but not associated with altered insulin concentrations. A single injection of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8, or combined with exendin-4, significantly (p < 0.05) lowered blood glucose levels 24â€‰h post injection in untreated high fat-fed mice. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of (pGlu-Gln)-CCK-8 alone and in combination with incretin hormones for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
