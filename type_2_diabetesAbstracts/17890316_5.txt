 OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether circulating adipokine concentrations can be altered by lifestyle intervention according to general recommendations in subjects at risk for diabetes as well as the potential of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin as biomarkers for lifestyle-induced improvements in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Study on Lifestyle intervention and Impaired glucose tolerance Maastricht, 147 men and women with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were randomized to either a combined diet-and-exercise intervention or a control program. At baseline and after 1 year, an oral glucose tolerance test, an exercise test, and anthropometric measurements were performed. After 1 year, complete data of 103 subjects (50 intervention and 53 control subjects) were obtained. RESULTS: Lifestyle intervention reduced plasma leptin concentrations (-14.2%) in IGT subjects but did not alter plasma adiponectin (-0.3%) or resistin (-6.5%) concentrations despite marked improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in leptin concentration were related to improvements in insulin sensitivity independent of changes in body composition.
