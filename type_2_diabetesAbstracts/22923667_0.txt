 OBJECTIVE: BMI and albumin are commonly accepted parameters to recognize wasting in dialysis patients and are powerful predictors of morbidity and mortality. However, both parameters reveal limitations and may not cover the entire range of patients with wasting. The visceral protein transthyretin (TTR) may be helpful in overcoming the diagnostic and prognostic gap. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the association of TTR with morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The TTR concentration was determined in plasma samples of 1,177 hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes. Cox regression analyses were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of cardiovascular end points (CVEs) and mortality according to quartiles of TTR concentration for the total study cohort and the subgroups BMI ≥23 kg/m(2), albumin concentration ≥3.8 g/dL, and a combination of both. RESULTS: A low TTR concentration was associated with an increased risk for CVE for the total study cohort (HR 1.65 [95% CI 1.27-2.14]), patients with BMI ≥23 kg/m(2) (1.70 [1.22-2.37]), albumin ≥3.8 g/dL (1.68 [1.17-2.42]), and the combination of both (1.69 [1.13-2.53]). Additionally, a low TTR concentration predicted mortality for the total study cohort (1.79 [1.43-2.24]) and patients with BMI ≥23 kg/m(2) (1.46 [1.09-1.95]). CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrated that TTR is a useful predictor for cardiovascular outcome and mortality in diabetic hemodialysis patients. TTR was particularly useful in patients who were not identified to be at risk by BMI or albumin status.
