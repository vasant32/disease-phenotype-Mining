 AIMS: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an important regulator of glucose/lipid metabolism. Although there are studies examining the relationship between serum FGF21 levels and glucose homeostasis, the role of FGF21 remains unclear. The objective of this study was to examine whether serum FGF21 levels are associated with metabolic parameters in subjects with varying degrees of obesity and glucose tolerance and with complications in subjects with type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: The study consisted of 213 subjects who were lean and had normal glucose tolerance (lean NGT), were overweight with NGT, had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or had T2DM. Serum FGF21 levels and their associations with the parameters of adiposity, glucose tolerance and the presence of diabetic complications were examined. RESULTS: The serum FGF21 levels in T2DM were higher than in lean NGT. Serum FGF21 levels showed a positive correlation with the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in all subjects except for the T2DM subjects, who showed a correlation after adjustment of age, gender and body mass index. Moreover, the subjects with carotid artery plaque showed higher serum FGF21 levels than those without complications. CONCLUSION: Serum FGF21 levels were associated with the urine ACR and diabetic complications including carotid artery plaque.
