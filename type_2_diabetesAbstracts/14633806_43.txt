 OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin, secreted by fat cells, has regulatory functions on energy metabolism. Its low levels are predictive of future development of diabetes. Because no studies on the regulatory role of adiponectin in glucose homeostasis in Asian Indians exist, this analysis was performed to determine the prospective association of adiponectin and diabetes in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Baseline values of plasma adiponectin, results of anthropometry, fasting and 2-h plasma glucose levels, HbA(1c), results of lipid profile, and insulin resistance were analyzed in 91 subjects with IGT (53 men and 38 women) in a primary prevention study. Reassessment of glucose tolerance was performed during 1-year review. The predictive nature of adiponectin for development of diabetes was assessed using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. A control group comprising healthy, normoglycemic individuals was used for comparison. RESULTS: At follow-up, diabetes had developed in 25 of the 91 study subjects. The mean baseline adiponectin level was lower in the diabetic subjects than in the nondiabetic subjects (11.3 +/- 5.5 vs. 16.7 +/- 7.6 micro g/ml, P = 0.0017). Low adiponectin level was a strong predictor of future development of diabetes, and HbA(1c) also showed a positive predictive association. Women had higher adiponectin levels (16.4 +/- 6.1 micro g/ml) than men (13.9 +/- 7.6 micro g/ml) (P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: In Asian Indians, low plasma adiponectin level was predictive of future development of diabetes.
