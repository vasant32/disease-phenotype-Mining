 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Surveys in northern Ethiopia have demonstrated that apparent type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently than elsewhere in Africa and, indeed, in other parts of the world. We therefore investigated in detail a cohort of diabetic patients from this region to clarify the nature of this type of diabetes. METHODS: All patients attending the diabetic clinic at Mekelle Hospital in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia were investigated over a 6 week period. Clinical, demographic and anthropometric data were collected, as well as measurements of HbA(1c), fasting lipid profile, fasting serum C-peptide and serum markers of beta cell autoimmunity, i.e. islet antigen-2 and GAD antibodies (GADA). RESULTS: Of 105 patients seen, 69 (66%) were on insulin treatment and had been from or close to diagnosis. Their median age and diabetes duration were 30 and 5 years, respectively, with a male excess of 2:1. Median BMI was 20.6 kg/m². Despite these clinical characteristics suggestive of type 1 diabetes, only 42 of 69 (61%) patients were C-peptide-negative and 35% GADA-positive. Overall, 38 (36%) of the total group (n = 105) had immunological or C-peptide characteristics inconsistent with typical type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The clinical characteristics, local prevalence of undernutrition, and GADA and C-peptide heterogeneity suggest a malnutrition-related form of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Not all patients in northern Ethiopia with apparent type 1 diabetes appear to have the form of disease seen in Europids; their disease may, in fact, be related to malnutrition.
