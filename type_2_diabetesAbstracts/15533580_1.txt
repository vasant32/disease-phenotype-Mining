AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed that biguanide therapy in overweight patients reduced the risk for any diabetes-related endpoint and all-cause mortality. Biguanides lower the blood glucose values without stimulation of insulin release. We have investigated the short-term effect of buformin on insulin sensitivity, solved tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFRs), and serum lipids in overweight subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHOD: Thirteen overweight subjects with type 2 DM were examined. The subjects who were fed 20 kcal/kg body weight were divided into two subgroups according to whether they were treated by buformin (Buformin group), or dietary therapy alone (Diet group). Six patients were in Buformin group and seven patients were in Diet group. We calculated insulin-mediated glucose uptake by the liver and peripheral tissues using euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with an oral glucose load before and after buformin treatment or diet therapy for 2 weeks. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol (T-chol), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-chol), and sTNFR2 were significantly decreased, and hepatic glucose uptake significantly increased from 32 +/- 7 to 42 +/- 7% (P < 0.05) in Buformin group but did not changed significantly in Diet group. However, the glucose infusion rate thought to express insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissue, TNF-alpha, sTNFR1, fasting plasma insulin, C-peptide, and NEFA levels did not change significantly in both the groups after treatment. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Buformin improved insulin sensitivity in the liver and decreased T-chol, LDL-chol, and sTNFR2. The mechanism of action for buformin likely involves inhibition of TNF-alpha. Buformin lowers insulin resistance and risk factors for cardiovascular disease including serum lipid and will therefore, be useful in management of overweight type 2 DM patients.
