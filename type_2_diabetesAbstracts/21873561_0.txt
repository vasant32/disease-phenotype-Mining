 OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have identified a set of serological markers for telomere dysfunction and DNA damage. The relevance of these serological markers in type 2 diabetes remains elusive. We investigated the association of serological markers (elongation factor 1α [EF-1α], stathmin, and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase) with leukocyte telomere length, a functional variant of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), and susceptibility of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 930 patients and 867 control subjects were recruited to examine the association between leukocyte telomere length, UCP2 variant (-886G>A), recently identified serological markers, and type 2 diabetes. Telomere length was determined by a quantitative real-time PCR-based assay. EF-1α, stathmin, and C-reactive proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. N-acetyl-glucosaminidase was measured by an enzyme activity assay. The UCP2 variant was determined by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS: The average telomere length of type 2 diabetic patients was significantly shorter than that of control subjects. Serological N-acetyl-glucosaminidase correlates with both age and telomere length and was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects. Neither EF-1α nor stathmin showed significant difference between patients and control subjects. The UCP2-886G>A variant correlated with type 2 diabetes status but did not correlate with telomere length or the serological markers. Multivariate analysis showed that higher serological N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, shorter telomeres, and the UCP2-886G>A variant are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Serological N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, telomere length, and the UCP2-886G>A variant are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Serological N-acetyl-glucosaminidase correlates with telomere length but not with the UCP2-886G>A variant.
