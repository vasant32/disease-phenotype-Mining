 OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we aimed to validate the type 2 diabetes susceptibility alleles identified in six recent genome-wide association studies in the HHEX/KIF11/IDE (rs1111875), CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), and IGF2BP2 (rs4402960) loci, as well as the intergenic rs9300039 variant. Furthermore, we aimed to characterize quantitative metabolic risk phenotypes of the four variants. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The variants were genotyped in the population-based Inter99 cohort (n = 5,970), the ADDITION Study (n = 1,626), a population-based sample of young healthy subjects (n = 377), and in additional type 2 diabetic case (n = 2,111) and glucose-tolerant (n = 521) subjects. The case-control studies involved a total of 4,089 type 2 diabetic patients and 5,043 glucose-tolerant control subjects. RESULTS: We validated association of variants near HHEX/KIF11/IDE, CDKN2A/B, and IGF2BP2 with type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, in middle-aged people, the rs1111875 C-allele of HHEX/KIF11/IDE strongly associated with lower acute insulin response during an oral glucose tolerance test (P = 6 x 10(-7)). In addition, decreased insulin release following intravenous tolbutamide injection was observed in young healthy subjects (P = 0.02). Also, a reduced insulin release was observed for the CDKN2A/B rs10811661 T-allele after both oral and intravenous glucose challenges (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We validate that variants in the proximity of the HHEX/KIF11/IDE, CDKN2A/B, and IFG2BP2 loci associate with type 2 diabetes. Importantly, variations within the HHEX/KIF11/IDE and CDKN2A/B loci confer impaired glucose- and tolbutamide-induced insulin release in middle-aged and young healthy subjects, suggesting a role for these variants in the pathogenesis of pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.
