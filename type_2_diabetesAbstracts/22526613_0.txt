 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Microalbuminuria represents an established surrogate marker of early diabetic nephropathy and glomerular microangiopathy. Increasing evidence is emerging of a role of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) as an important link between obesity, insulin resistance and both macro- and microangiopathy. It is not known whether perivascular renal sinus fat (RSF) has an impact on microalbuminuria in the prediabetic stage. We investigated whether RSF quantified by MRI is associated with microalbuminuria before or after exercise. METHODS: Non-diabetic individuals at increased risk of type 2 diabetes were recruited into the Tübingen Lifestyle Intervention Program (TULIP); 146 participants took part in the analysis. RSF was measured in axial MRI sections at the level of the renal artery. Urine was collected before and after exercise stress testing. RESULTS: Participants (age 47 ± 12 years; mean ± SD) reached a mean exercise load of 176 ± 49 W, with a mean arterial peak pressure (MAPP) of 112 ± 14 mmHg. After adjusting for sex, age, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and MAPP during exercise, RSF was significantly associated with postexercise albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR; p = 0.006). No association between RSF and baseline BP could be observed after adjusting for confounders (p = 0.26), and there was no association between RSF and baseline ACR either (p = 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: RSF is associated with exercise-induced albuminuria independently of sex, age, VAT and MAPP in a non-diabetic cohort at diabetic risk. We conclude that PVAT in the renal sinus may play a role in the pathogenesis of microalbuminuria.
