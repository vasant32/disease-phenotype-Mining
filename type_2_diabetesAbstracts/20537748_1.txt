 AIMS: The present study aimed to explore the impact of the angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker valsartan (VAL) on inflammatory-/lipid-/glucose parameters in hypertensive diabetic patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS: This was a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-center study with VAL 320 mg/d in 109 hypertensive diabetic patients (n=56 non-CAD; n=53 CAD). RESULTS: VAL treatment did not significantly affect serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) levels in the overall study population but significantly reduced serum IL-6 in the subgroup with high inflammatory load at baseline (IL-6>median (2.0 ng/L), n=54: [median, ng/L]): VAL: from 3.5 to 2.4; placebo: from 3.2 to 3.5; p=0.035). VAL significantly lowered total- and LDL-cholesterol in the whole study population: [median, mg/dL]: total cholesterol: VAL: from 178 to 168; placebo: from 174 to 173, p=0.039; LDL-cholesterol: VAL: from 96 to 90, placebo: from 102 to 103, p=0.006, whereas glycemic parameters were not affected. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates significant anti-inflammatory efficacy of VAL in hypertensive diabetic patients with enhanced inflammatory burden. High-dose VAL therapy significantly lowered total- and LDL-cholesterol levels. The combined actions of cholesterol and blood pressure lowering by VAL may provide additional clinical benefits for these high-risk patients.
