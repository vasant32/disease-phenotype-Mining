 OBJECTIVE: To review the current knowledge about nonpharmacologic approaches in the prevention and early treatment of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study reviewed the research reports dealing with nonpharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing type 2 diabetes with early lifestyle interventions. RESULTS: The results from the randomized controlled trials all show that people with impaired glucose tolerance who received enhanced lifestyle advice had significantly lower (on average approximately 50% reduced) incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with those allocated to receive "usual care." Individuals who were able to correct their lifestyle habits as recommended for usual healthy life patterns were mostly protected against type 2 diabetes. Thus, compelling evidence exists that most of the cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or at least the onset of the disease can be significantly delayed. CONCLUSIONS: Randomized controlled trials have unequivocally demonstrated that lifestyle management is highly efficient in the prevention and also in the early management of type 2 diabetes. This evidence of lifestyle modification in diabetes prevention is stronger than for most other multifactorial diseases.
