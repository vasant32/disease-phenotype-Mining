The study analyzed the clinical background and eating habits of Japanese youth-onset type 2 diabetes. Thirty-six patients with type 2 diabetes (22 males, 14 females) with onset in less than 20-year-old were studied. All patients were negative for anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody and islet cell antibody. Cases diagnosed as having abnormalities in the mitochondrial gene, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and apparent type 1 diabetes were excluded from the study. Urinary ketone was detected positive in 11 cases among 36 patients at the onset of diabetes. We compared the clinical characteristics and food compositions between the patients with ketonuria and those without ketonuria. Age and urinary C-peptide secretion did not show any significant difference between both groups. In the patients with ketonuria, male to female ratio was remarkably high (10:1) compared with the group without ketonuria (12:13). Positive diabetic family history was predominantly higher in the group with ketonuria (11/11) than that in the group without ketonuria (17/25). All these were identical to previously reported characteristics of soft-drink ketosis. However, we in this study, revealed the difference of total calorie intake and dietary composition between youth-onset type 2 diabetes with and without ketonuria. As a result dietary contents such as carbohydrate, fat and confectionery in the former group were also 1.5, 1.4-2.4 times higher, respectively, than those in the latter group.
