The intestinal fatty-acid binding protein-2 (FABP2) gene codes a protein responsible for the absorption of long-chain fatty acids. To test whether FABP2 is a candidate gene for renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, a functional A54T polymorphism was genotyped in 1,042 Brazilians with type 2 diabetes. Patients were classified as having normoalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion [UAE] <20 microg/min; n = 529), microalbuminuria (UAE 20-199 microg/min; n = 217), or proteinuria (UAE >199 microg/min; n = 160). Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (n = 136) were also included. The prevalence of the TT genotype was higher in patients with renal involvement compared with those with normoalbuminuria (odds ratio [95% CI] 2.4 [1.1-5.4]) following adjustment for type 2 diabetes duration, BMI, hypertension, A1C, and cholesterol levels. The risk was similar considering different stages of renal involvement. In a second independent patient sample (483 type 2 diabetic Caucasians residing in Massachusetts), a significant association was also observed between the TT genotype and proteinuria or ESRD (2.7 [1.0-7.3]; P = 0.048). This study thus provides evidence that FABP2 confers susceptibility to renal disease in type 2 diabetic patients.
