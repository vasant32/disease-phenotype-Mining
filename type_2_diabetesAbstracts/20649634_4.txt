 AIM: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) stimulates beta-cell proliferation and enhances beta-cell survival, whereas oligomerization of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) may induce beta-cell apoptosis and reduce beta-cell mass. Type 2 diabetes is associated with increased expression of IAPP. As GLP-1-based therapy is currently developed as a novel antidiabetic therapy, we examined the potential protective action of the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 on hIAPP-induced beta-cell apoptosis. METHODS: The study was performed in clonal insulinoma (INS-1E) cells. Both method of transcriptional and translational and sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assays were used to evaluate cell viability and cell mass. Western blot analysis was applied to detect protein expression. Transfection of constitutively active protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) was performed to examine the role of AKT. Mitochondrial biogenesis was quantified by mitogreen staining and RT-PCR. RESULTS: First, we confirmed that hIAPP induced cell apoptosis and growth inhibition in INS-1E cells. These effects were partially protected by exendin-4 in association with partial recovery of the hIAPP-mediated AKT inhibition. Furthermore, AKT constitutive activation attenuated hIAPP-induced apoptosis, whereas PI3K/AKT inhibition abrogated exendin-4-mediated effects. These findings suggest that the antiapoptotic and proliferative effects of exendin-4 in hIAPP-treated INS-1E cells were partially mediated through AKT pathway. Moreover, hIAPP induced FOXO1 but inhibited pdx-1 nucleus translocation. These effects were restored by exendin-4. Finally, mitogreen staining and RT-PCR revealed enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis by exendin-4 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonist protects beta cells from hIAPP-induced cell death partially through the activation of AKT pathway and improved mitochondrial function.
