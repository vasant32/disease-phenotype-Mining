We investigated the effect of an 8 week circuit training (CT) program, combining aerobic and resistance exercise, on indices of glycemic control, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and body composition in 16 subjects (age 52 +/- 2 years) with type 2 diabetes using a prospective randomised crossover protocol. Submaximal exercise heart rate and rate pressure product were significantly lower after training (P<0.05), whilst ventilatory threshold increased (11.8 +/- 0.7 vs 13.8 +/- 0.6 ml kg(-1)min(-1), P<0.001). Muscular strength also increased with training (403 +/- 30 to 456 +/- 31 kg, P<0.001), whilst skinfolds (148.7 +/- 11.5 vs 141.1 +/- 10.7 mm, P<0.05), % body fat (29.5 +/- 1.0 vs 28.7 +/- 1.1%, P<0.05) and waist:hip ratio (99.2 +/- 1.5 vs 97.9 +/- 1.4%, P<0.05) significantly decreased. Concurrently, peak oxygen uptake (P<0.05) and exercise test duration (P<0.001) increased following training, whilst glycated hemoglobin (P<0.05) and fasting blood glucose (P<0.05) decreased. CT is an effective method of training that improved functional capacity, lean body mass, strength and glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
