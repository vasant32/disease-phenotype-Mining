Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2) mRNA expression has been shown to be altered by metabolic conditions such as obesity in humans, but its functional significance is unknown. The expression of UCP-2 mRNA and protein in normal rat islets was established by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry in pancreatic islets and tissue, respectively. Intense immunostaining of UCP-2 correlated with insulin-positive ,-cells. Overexpression of UCP-2 in normal rat islets was accomplished by infection with an adenovirus (AdEGI-UCP-2) containing the full-length human UCP-2 coding sequence. Induction of the AdEGI-UCP-2 gene resulted in severe blunting of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) without affecting islet insulin content or the ability of the calcium ionophore A23187 to increase insulin secretion from AdEGI-UCP-2-expressing islets. Therefore, UCP-2 overexpression affects signal transduction proximal to Ca2+-mediated steps, including exocytosis. Insulin secretion from single beta-cells to 16.5 mmol/l glucose examined by reverse hemolytic plaque assay was nearly ablated if UCP-2 was overexpressed. Thus, a direct, causal relationship between overexpression of UCP-2 and inhibition of GSIS in normal islets has been established. These data suggest that increased expression of UCP-2 has the potential to cause the lack of a glucose effect on insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes.
