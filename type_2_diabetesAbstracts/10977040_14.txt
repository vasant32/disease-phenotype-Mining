OBJECTIVE: Endothelial markers endothelin 1 (ET-1) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were assessed in patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia and in patients with hypercholesterolemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this case-control study, plasma ET-and vWF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 35 normoalbuminuric type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia (56+/-5 years), in 21 nondiabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia (52+/-7 years), and in 19 healthy control subjects (45+/-4 years). All of the individuals were normotensive and nonsmokers. Urinary albumin was measured by immunoturbidimetry. RESULTS: ET-1 levels were higher (P<0.0001) in type 2 diabetic dyslipidemic patients (1.62+/-0.73 pg/ml) than in both nondiabetic hypercholesterolemic patients (0.91+/-0.73 pg/ml) and control subjects (0.69+/-0.25 pg/ml). vWF levels were significantly increased (P = 0.02) in type 2 diabetic (185.49+/-72.1%) and hypercholesterolemic (163.29+/-50.7%) patients compared with control subjects (129.70+/-35.2%). In the multiple linear regression analysis. ET-1 was significantly associated (adjusted r2 = 0.42) with serum triglyceride levels (P<0.001), age (P<0.01), insulin sensitivity index (P<0.02), and albuminuria levels (P<0.04). vWF levels were associated (adjusted r2 = 0.22) with albuminuria (P<0.001), fibrinogen levels (P<0.02), and BMI (P<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with hypercholesterolemic patients, type 2 diabetic patients with dyslipidemia have increased levels of ET-1 and vWF which may indicate more pronounced endothelial injury. These findings appear to be related to components of the insulin resistance syndrome.
