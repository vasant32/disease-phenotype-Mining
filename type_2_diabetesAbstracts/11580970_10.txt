The aim of this study was to provide an overview of diabetes management and complication status in Taiwan. A cohort of 2446 patients (from 25 diabetic centers) with more than 12 months of diabetes management participated and data were collected by interviews and reviewing the medical records. Overall, 97% were diagnosed as type 2 diabetes, with a mean age (+/-S.D.) of 61.6+/-11.3 years, duration of diabetes of 10.3+/-7.3 years and age at onset of diabetes of 51.5+/-11.8 years. Mean BMI was 25.1+/-3.6 kg/m(2) and about 50% had BMI>25 kg/m(2). Majority (75%) were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs), 14% with insulin and 10% with combination of insulin and OHA. Mean HbA(1c) was 8.1+/-1.6% and 59% had HbA(1c) >7.4% (1% above the upper limit of normal range, 4.7-6.4%). Mean FBG was 9.0+/-3.3 mmol/l and 59% had FBG>7.8 mmol/l. Of all the patients who had screening for complications, cataract (38%), neuropathy (30%), proteinuria (17%) and stroke (6%) were the most frequently reported eye, feet, kidney and late complications. We conclude that the majority of patients involved in this study had unsatisfactory glycaemic control which may lead to diabetes complications.
