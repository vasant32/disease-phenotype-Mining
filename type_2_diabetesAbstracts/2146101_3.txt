We studied the incorporation of dietary n - 3 fatty acids from marine oils into red cell membranes, using animal models of type 1 diabetes (streptozotocin-treated Wistar rats) and type 2 diabetes (gold-thioglucose-injected CBA/T6 mice). In type 1 diabetic rats, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were higher following marine oil supplementation, and the increase in EPA was significantly greater than in non-diabetic animals (3.4 +/- 1.4% vs. 0.8 +/- 1.6%). Marine oil supplementation also resulted in higher levels of EPA and DHA in mice, but the increases were quantitatively similar with and without type 2 diabetes. Improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin following n - 3 fatty acid feeding was only found in type 2 diabetes (6.5 +/- 2.9% vs. 9.5 +/- 1.2%). This was associated with a higher plasma insulin concentration (170 +/- 40 vs. 136 +/- 41 mU/ml). The theory that n - 3 fatty acids improve insulin sensitivity would have predicted a decrease in plasma insulin levels. Our results suggest that n - 3 fatty acids may modify insulin secretion.
