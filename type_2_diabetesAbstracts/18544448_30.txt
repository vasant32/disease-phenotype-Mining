Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and is frequently found in people with type 2 diabetes. SDB not only causes poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, but has clinical consequences, including hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition to supporting the need for further research into the links between SDB and diabetes, the International Diabetes Federation Taskforce on Epidemiology and Prevention strongly recommends that health professionals working in both type 2 diabetes and SDB adopt clinical practices to ensure that a patient presenting with one condition is considered for the other.
