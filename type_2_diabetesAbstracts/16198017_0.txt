We sought to identify lifestyle behaviours which influence risk of impaired glucose metabolism, IGM (newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance [IGT] or impaired fasting glycemia [IFG]) or insulin resistance (IR) in a predominantly Maori community, and applied the McAuley formula to determine whether it predicts high risk individuals amongst this community. Three hundred and seventy one participants completed a lifestyle and dietary behaviour questionnaire and oral glucose tolerance test. Clinical variables, microalbuminuria, fasting glucose, insulin and lipids were measured. Diabetes, IFG and IGT were defined according to WHO criteria. IR was defined using the McAuley formula. Those with IGM and those with IR showed similar risk factor attributes. Odds ratios (95% CI) for development of IGM and IR were 0.43 (0.21-0.88) and 0.51 (0.33-0.80), respectively, for regular physical activity, and 0.55 (0.26-1.15) and 0.59 (0.37-0.96), respectively, for two or more dietary behaviours characterized by a high intake of fibre. Regular physical activity and a diet characterized by a high intake of dietary fibre were found to reduce risk of newly diagnosed IGM or IR. The McAuley formula appears to predict high-risk individuals in a predominantly Maori population as it does in European populations.
