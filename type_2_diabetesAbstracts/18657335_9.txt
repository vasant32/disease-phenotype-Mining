Diabetes mellitus is the most common chronic metabolic disease. The raising diabetes epidemic is unfolding as an interaction between several environmental factors and a genetic predisposition. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the PPARgamma-Pro12Ala and ENPP1-K121Q polymorphisms on type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in a case-control study in the Tunisian population. To assess for any association of ENPP1-K121Q and PPARgamma-Pro12Ala polymorphisms with T2D risk, we analysed the genotypic and allelic distributions of each variant in the studied cohort. Our results support that the genetic variation at ENPP1-K121Q predisposes to T2D in the Tunisian population after adjustment on gender, age and BMI status (OR=1.55, 95%CI [1.11-2.16], p=0.007). Conversely, the PPARgamma-Pro12Ala variant seems not to have a significant effect on T2D risk in our Tunisian cohort. However, the minor A-allele would convey protection against overweight in the Tunisian population. In fact, the over weighted subjects showed a significantly lower frequency of A-allele than lean controls (OR=0.49, 95%CI [0.25-0.97], p=0.02). In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that ENPP1-121Q is involved in the genetic susceptibility of T2D in the Tunisian population, while the PPARgamma-12Ala allele may confer protection against overweight.
