 OBJECTIVE: To study the association of the inflammatory markers serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) with retinal microvascular parameters in hypertensive individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis was a substudy in 711 patients (159 with and 552 without diabetes) of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) based on digital 30-degree images of superior and inferior temporal retinal fields. RESULTS: SAA was associated with arteriolar length-to-diameter ratio positively in nondiabetic patients (P(trend)= 0.028) but negatively in diabetic patients (P(trend)= 0.005). The difference was unlikely to be a chance finding (P = 0.007 for interaction). Similar results were found for the association of SAA with arteriolar tortuosity (P = 0.05 for interaction). Associations were less pronounced for CRP and retinal parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory processes are differentially involved in retinal microvascular disease in diabetic compared with nondiabetic hypertensive individuals.
