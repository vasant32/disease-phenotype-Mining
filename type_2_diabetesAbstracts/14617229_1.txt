BACKGROUND: Obesity is known to be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), arterial hypertension (HT) and hyperlipidaemia (HL), but the relationship between the duration of obesity and these outcomes is variable in the literature. AIMS: The aims of this study were 1) to evaluate whether the duration of obesity is a risk factor for type 2 DM, HT and HL, 2) to determine the incidence of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), type 2 DM, HT and HL in the patients attending our clinic because of obesity and 3) to determine the correlation between DM, HT and HL and age, body mass index (BMI), duration of obesity and waist-hip ratio (WHR). METHODS: Informed consent was obtained from 200 consecutive women presenting to our Endocrinology and Metabolism Unit for the first time because of obesity. The patient's history of the age at onset of obesity, HT and family history of DM were obtained. Anthropometric measurements and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed. RESULTS: On OGTT, 15 (7.5%) had IFG, 36 (18%) had IGT and 18 (9%) had type 2 DM; in addition, 96 (48%) had HT and 76 (38%) had HL. Upon multivariate logistic regression analysis, age was a common risk factor for IGT, type 2 DM, HT and HL, and a family history of diabetes was an additional risk factor for type 2 DM. CONCLUSION: The duration of obesity, as reported by women presenting for treatment of obesity, is not a risk factor for type 2 DM, HT and HL.
