There exists lipoprotein lipase mass in preheparin serum, even though the activity is scarcely found. We studied the preheparin serum lipoprotein lipase mass levels (prehaparin LPL mass) in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and the effect of insulin therapy on the levels of preheparin LPL mass. In 40 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, preheparin LPL mass were measured by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and were compared with those of non-diabetic healthy control. The correlation between preheparin LPL mass and Hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), serum lipids were studied. Preheparin LPL mass were measured before and after insulin therapy. Preheparin LPL mass of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients was significantly lower than that of non-diabetic healthy control. In diabetic patients, preheparin LPL mass were negatively correlated with HbA(1c). Fifteen patients started to take insulin therapy. Preheparin LPL mass increased significantly at 4th week, when fasting blood glucose decreased. These results suggested that preheparin LPL mass was greatly regulated by insulin action.
