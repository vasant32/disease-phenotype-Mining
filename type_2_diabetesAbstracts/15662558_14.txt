AIMS/HYPOTHESES: We examined the effects of lipase inhibition with orlistat on (i) gastric emptying of, and (ii) the glycaemic, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and cardiovascular responses to, a high-fat/carbohydrate meal in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Eight type 2 diabetic patients, who were aged 62 years (median range: 49-68 years) and managed by diet alone, consumed a meal containing 65 g powdered potato, 20 g glucose reconstituted with 200 ml water (labelled with 20 MBq (99m)Tc-sulphur-colloid) and 45 g margarine. They did this on two separate occasions, with and without 120 mg orlistat, and while in the seated position with their back against a gamma camera. Venous blood samples for measurement of blood glucose, plasma insulin and GLP-1 were obtained immediately before the meal and at regular intervals afterwards. Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate were measured using an automated device. RESULTS: Gastric emptying of the meal was faster after orlistat than without orlistat (50% emptying time [mean +/- SEM], 61+/-8 min vs 98+/-5 min; p=0.0001). In the first 60 min after the meal blood glucose (p=0.001) and plasma insulin (p=0.01) concentrations were higher in patients who had taken orlistat; between 60 and 180 min plasma GLP-1 (p=0.02) concentrations were lower after orlistat than without orlistat. Between 0 and 30 min systolic blood pressure (p=0.003) was lower, and heart rate (p=0.03) greater in subjects who had taken orlistat than in those who had not. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Inhibition of fat digestion by orlistat may-as a result of more rapid gastric emptying-exacerbate postprandial glycaemia and the postprandial fall in blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes after ingestion of meals containing fat and carbohydrate.
