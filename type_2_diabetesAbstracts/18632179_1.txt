 AIMS: The atherogenicity of chylomicron remnants has been discussed. We examined whether serum apoB48 level is associated with the presence of carotid plaque in type 2 diabetic patients. METHOD: Forty type 2 diabetic patients (21 males and 19 females, 52.8+/-11.8 years old; mean+/-S.D.) were divided into two groups by the presence or absence of carotid plaque. The diurnal change of serum apoB48 level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Fasting serum apoB48 level was higher in the subjects with carotid plaque than those without (6.5+/-3.8vs. 4.1+/-1.9 microg/ml, p=0.01). Age- and gender-adjusted analysis showed that the presence of carotid plaque was associated with fasting apoB48 (OR 1.43; 95% CI, 1.07-2.09, p=0.04) and triglyceride (OR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02-1.32, p=0.04) levels. In normal LDL-cholesterol (<140 mg/dl) subjects, the presence of carotid plaque was associated with fasting apoB48 level (OR 2.16; 95% CI, 1.22-5.32, p=0.04), but not associated with fasting triglyceride level (OR 1.11; 95% CI, 0.99-1.30, p=0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Serum apoB48 level was strongly associated with the presence of carotid plaque in type 2 diabetic patients.
