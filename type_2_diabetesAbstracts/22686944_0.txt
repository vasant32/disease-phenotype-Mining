 AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivoglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist in the thiazolidinedione class, in subjects with suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Subjects aged ≥18 years with T2DM and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >7.0% and ≤8.5%, who were treatment naïve or receiving a non-thiazolidinedione antidiabetes monotherapy, entered a 2-week washout and single-blind placebo run-in period and were then randomized 2 : 4 : 11 : 11 to double-blind treatment with placebo, rivoglitazone 1.0 mg/day, rivoglitazone 1.5 mg/day, or pioglitazone 45 mg/day, for 26 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 1912 subjects received placebo (n = 137), rivoglitazone 1.0 mg (n = 274), rivoglitazone 1.5 mg (n = 750) or pioglitazone (n = 751). Rivoglitazone 1.5 mg was statistically superior (p = 0.0339) and rivoglitazone 1.0 mg was non-inferior (p = 0.0339) to pioglitazone in reducing HbA1c from baseline (changes of -0.7%, -0.4% and -0.6%, respectively). Rivoglitazone also significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose from baseline (p < 0.0001). Rivoglitazone significantly improved estimates of insulin sensitivity, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and other metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers. Rivoglitazone was generally well tolerated at both doses, with treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) rates similar to pioglitazone. The most common drug-related TEAEs were peripheral oedema (active, 5.2-6.2%; placebo 0.7%), increased weight (active, 1.6-3.1%; placebo, 0%) and pitting oedema (active, 1.3-2.2%; placebo, 0%). CONCLUSIONS: In subjects with suboptimally controlled T2DM, rivoglitazone 1.5 mg was associated with statistically superior glycaemic control to pioglitazone 45 mg, while rivoglitazone 1.0 mg was non-inferior; the safety profiles of the two drugs appeared similar.
