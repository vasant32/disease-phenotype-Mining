 OBJECTIVE: Coffee consumption has been linked to detrimental acute metabolic and hemodynamic effects. We investigated coffee consumption in relation to risk of CVDs and mortality in diabetic men. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study including 3,497 diabetic men without CVD at baseline. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, smoking, and other cardiovascular risk factors, relative risks (RRs) were 0.88 (95% CI 0.50-1.57) for CVDs (P for trend = 0.29) and 0.80 (0.41-1.54) for all-cause mortality (P for trend = 0.45) for the consumption of >or=4 cups/day of caffeinated coffee compared with those for non-coffee drinkers. Stratification by smoking and duration of diabetes yielded similar results. RRs for caffeine intake for the highest compared with the lowest quintile were 1.02 (0.70-1.47; P for trend = 0.96) for CVDs and 0.96 (0.64-1.44; P for trend = 0.69) for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that regular coffee consumption is not associated with increased risk for CVDs or mortality in diabetic men.
