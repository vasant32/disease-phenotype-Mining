 AIMS: We aimed to assess changes in serum adiponectin and endothelial function after intensive insulin treatment in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed T2DM were randomly assigned to Group A (intensive insulin treatment) or Group B (conventional insulin treatment). Before treatment and 2 weeks after plasma glucose concentrations had been maintained at the specified concentrations, blood samples were obtained to measure serum adiponectin and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations. A total of 21 patients were randomized to each Group. RESULTS: Adiponectin, NO, endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDD), and endothelium-independent vasodilation (EID) measures were significantly higher post-treatment than pre-treatment in Group A (all P < 0.05). Only EID was significantly higher in Group B (P<0.05). Post-treatment adiponectin and NO concentrations, and EDD were significantly higher in Group A compared with Group B (all P<0.05). Both treatment regimens were well tolerated (all patients completed the study). The most common adverse event was hypoglycemia. Thus, early intensive insulin therapy can increase serum adiponectin and NO concentrations and improve endothelial function in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: These effects may underlie the reduced incidence of microvascular and macrovascular in patients who receive early intensive hypoglycemic therapy.
