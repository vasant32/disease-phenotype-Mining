Among a number of different lipoprotein abnormalities, 'midband lipoprotein' migrating at a position between LDL and VLDL on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), is an atherogenic lipoprotein and intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery is a useful marker of atherosclerotic diseases. The present study evaluated relationships between the presence of 'midband lipoprotein' and carotid IMT in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The average IMT of the carotid artery was determined from the means of maximal thicknesses of both left and right common carotid arteries, carotid bulb, and internal carotid artery using ultrasound B mode imaging in 118 Japanese patients (72 men, 46 women) and 43 healthy controls. Multivariate regression analyses indicated that the duration of diabetes and presence of 'midband lipoprotein' were independent determinants of carotid artery IMT in 46 female subjects with diabetes, and these subjects were then subclassified into midband-positive (n=24) and midband-negative (n=22) groups. IMT of the carotid artery was significantly different between midband-positive (0.98+/-0.32mm) and midband-negative (0.79+/-0.17mm) groups (P=0.02). These findings suggest that 'midband lipoprotein' is a possible risk factor for IMT of the carotid artery in Japanese female type 2 diabetic patients.
