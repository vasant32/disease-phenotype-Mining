 OBJECTIVE: To estimate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and treatment satisfaction for patients with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands and to examine which patient characteristics are associated with quality of life and treatment satisfaction. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For a sample of 1,348 type 2 diabetes patients, recruited by 29 general practitioners, we collected data regarding HRQOL. This study was performed as part of a larger European study (Cost of Diabetes in Europe - Type 2 [CODE-2]). We used a generic instrument (Euroqol 5D) to measure HRQOL. Treatment satisfaction was assessed using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: Patients without complications had an HRQOL (0.74) only slightly lower than similarly aged persons in the general population. Insulin therapy, obesity, and complications were associated with a lower HRQOL, independent of age and sex. Although higher fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels were negatively associated with HRQOL, these factors were not significant after adjustment for other factors using multivariate analysis. Overall treatment satisfaction was very high. Younger patients, patients using insulin, and patients with higher HbA1c levels were less satisfied with the treatment than other patients. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity and the presence of complications are important determinants of HRQOL in patients with type 2 diabetes.
