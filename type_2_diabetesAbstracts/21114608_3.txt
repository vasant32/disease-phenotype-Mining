The aim of the present study was to analyse effects of sulphonylurea treatment on parameters of glycaemic control in relation to transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) genotypes. In 87 patients with type 2 diabetes who failed to achieve glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, effects of 6-month sulphonylurea in addition to metformin on reductions in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were evaluated. Reduction in HbA1c and FPG in response to 6-month sulphonylurea treatment was significantly higher in patients with CC genotype compared to those with the CT+TT genotype (1.16 ± 0.07 vs. 0.86 ± 0.07%, p = 0.003; 1.57 ± 0.12 vs. 1.14 ± 0.14 mmol/l, p = 0.031, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, baseline HbA1c and the TCF7L2 genotype were the only significant predictors of HbA1c reduction. In conclusion, the magnitude of HbA1c and FPG reductions after 6-month sulphonylurea treatment in addition to metformin is related to the TCF7L2 gene polymorphism.
