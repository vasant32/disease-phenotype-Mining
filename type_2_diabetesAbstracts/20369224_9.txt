 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with an increased prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Information on this issue is lacking for type 1 diabetes. We evaluated whether NAFLD is associated with increased prevalence of retinopathy and CKD in type 1 diabetic patients. METHODS: All type 1 diabetic patients (n = 202) who regularly attended our diabetes clinic and did not have any clinical evidence of cirrhosis or other secondary causes of chronic liver disease were studied. Main study measures were detection of NAFLD (by patient history and liver ultrasound), diabetic retinopathy (diagnosed by ophthalmoscopy) and CKD (defined as abnormal albuminuria or estimated GFR of < or =60 ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)). RESULTS: The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (53.2 vs 19.8%) and CKD (37.8 vs 9.9%) was markedly higher in patients with NAFLD than in those without (p < 0.0001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, NAFLD was associated with prevalent retinopathy (adjusted OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.4-7.6, p = 0.005) or CKD (adjusted OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.5-10.1, p = 0.005). These associations were independent of age, sex, diabetes duration, HbA(1c), medication use and presence of the metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD is associated, independently of several confounding factors, with a higher prevalence of CKD and retinopathy in type 1 diabetic individuals.
