Recent studies suggest that blockade of angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor may have some effect on glucose and lipoprotein metabolism. Serum level of preheparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) reflects LPL production mainly in adipocytes and is believed to be related to insulin sensitivity. We studied the effect of a selective AT1 antagonist, valsartan, on glucose, lipid metabolism and the preheparin LPL mass in 55 patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Patients were randomized into a group administered valsartan 80 mg/day for 12 weeks or a group not administered valsartan (control). Blood pressure decreased significantly. HbA1c and TG levels decreased and HDL-C level increased, but these changes tended to be significantly different. TC and LDL-C levels were not significant changes. Preheparin LPL mass increased after valsartan administration compared with control (P = 0.0307), and migration ratio of LDL (LDL-Rm), which correlated negatively with LDL particle size, decreased compared with control (P < 0.0001). DeltaLDL-Rm correlated inversely with Delta preheparin LPL mass (r = -0.459). Among subjects treated with valsartan, greater improvement in preheparin LPL mass and blood pressure was observed in the subgroup with preheparin LPL mass <40 ng/ml. The results of this study suggest that valsartan may enhance LPL production in adipocytes, resulting in enlarged LDL particle size.
