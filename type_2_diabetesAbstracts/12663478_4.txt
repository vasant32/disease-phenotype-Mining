Current methods for measuring long-term glycemia in patients with diabetes are HbA(1c) and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are estimated by phenyl boronate affinity chromatography and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. In this study, we hypothesize that the intrinsic fluorescence property of hemoglobin-AGE (Hb-AGE) may be a simple, accurate, and therefore better index for long-term glycemic status due to its highly specific nature and longer half-life. To establish this contention, in vitro and in vivo experiments were carried out. The former was performed by incubating commercially available hemoglobin with 5 and 20 mmol/l glucose and the latter through experimentally induced (streptozotocin) diabetes in an animal model (male Wistar rats) to identify the new fluorophore formed due to the nonenzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin. An adduct exhibiting fluorescence at 308/345 nm of excitation/emission wavelengths has been identified and its time-dependent formation established. Under in vitro conditions, the first appearance of the new fluorophore was noticed only after a period of 2 months, whereas under in vivo conditions, it increased significantly after 2 months of hyperglycemia. Consistent with the observations, studies on patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrated an elevated level of this new fluorescent adduct in patients with persisting high levels of plasma glucose for >2 months. Based on the results obtained, Hb-AGE appears to be an efficient fluorescence-based biosensing molecule for the long-term monitoring of glycemic control in diabetes.
