AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: This study aims to determine the prevalence of anti-pericyte autoantibodies in Type 2 diabetes and to characterize these autoantibodies as new markers of disease activity in diabetic retinopathy. METHODS: A total of 299 patients with Type 2 diabetes participated in this study. Retinopathy was assessed by 7-field stereo fundus photography and was graded according to the ETDRS scale. Serum anti-pericyte autoantibodies were detected by immunofluorescence on tissue cultured bovine retinal pericytes. RESULTS: The prevalence of anti-pericyte autoantibodies in Type 2 diabetic patients was 54% and was approximately equal in men and women. The prevalence was approximately 55% with retinopathy at grades from 10 to 53. At grades above 53 the prevalence declined to 23% ( p<0.0001). The highest prevalence by duration of diabetes, 70%, was found at 0 to 5 years and the lowest, 25% at more than 25 years duration ( p<0.0001). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Anti-pericyte autoantibodies are present at high prevalence in Type 2 diabetes. Their presence during earlier stages of retinopathy could be due to a reaction with antigens expressed by "activated" pericytes. The decline in antibody prevalence in advanced retinopathy could mark pericyte loss and progression to an angiogenic retinal milieu.
