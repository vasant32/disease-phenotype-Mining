Recent evidence from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study convincingly demonstrates that good glycaemic control is difficult to achieve and, despite its positive impact on microvascular complications, is not sufficient to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Syndrome X--a cluster of abnormalities associated with resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake that have been implicated in accelerating atherogenesis--provides a useful clinical concept to prevent CHD in patients with type 2 diabetes. Components of syndrome X can include hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia, dyslipidaemia, and a procoagulant state, changes that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are usually close to normal, but the LDL-C is present in abnormally small and dense particles. Triglyceride levels are elevated and are associated with an increase in postprandial accumulation of atherogenic, remnant lipoprotein particles. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are typically low. This particular dyslipidaemia, along with hyperinsulinaemia, induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, contributing to a prothrombotic state. In addition, plaque formation may be accelerated in insulin-resistant subjects by increased expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and increased rate of monocyte adhesion to cultured endothelial cells. Syndrome X and type 2 diabetes are associated with multiple abnormalities that enhance the atherosclerotic process. The opportunities for new therapeutic approaches to reduce cardiovascular risk will undoubtedly evolve along with our understanding of the complex factors responsible for insulin resistance, compensatory hyperinsulinaemia, and CHD.
