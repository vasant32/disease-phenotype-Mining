Fasting plasma glucose is a multigenic trait related to both diabetes and obesity. We performed a genome scan for quantitative fasting plasma glucose levels in 320 families (1,514 subjects), segregating extreme obesity and normal weight using 382 autosomal microsatellite markers. We found significant linkages on 18q22-23 using family regression (logarithm of odds [LOD] 3.67, P = 0.00002, D18S1371 at 116 cM) and variance components (LOD 4.48, P < 0.00001) methods. Evidence for linkage remained strong when restricted to European Americans (260 families, 1,258 individuals). After an additional 60 families were added, the linkage signal strengthened (LOD 6.59). The result on 18q22-23 remained significant, even after controlling for both BMI and diabetes status. We also found suggestive linkages on chromosomes 2 (LOD 1.58, 216 cM) and 7 (LOD 1.78, 163 cM). Our results suggest that there is a quantitative trait locus in chromosome region 18q22-23 that influences fasting glucose levels and may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The strength of the serum glucose results after controlling for BMI suggests that this putative gene does not influence glucose levels merely through an effect on obesity.
