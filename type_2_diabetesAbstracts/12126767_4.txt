It is unknown whether the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan exerts a renoprotective effect on patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy independent of its hypotensive effects. Forty patients with type 2 diabetes participated in this study. All patients received valsartan 40 mg, a dose with no clinical effect on blood pressure levels. Blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion (UAE), and creatinine clearance were determined at baseline and at the end of the 6-month treatment period. Antihypertensive and/or antidiabetic drugs, including insulin, were permitted throughout the study. After 6 months of valsartan therapy, mean UAE decreased from 86.8 +/- 196 to 46.9 +/- 97 microg/min (n = 37). In addition, a significant decrease was observed in the UAE of the subgroup of patients displaying diabetic nephropathy (UAE > 20 microg/min, n = 14), from 219.4 +/- 275 to 102.7 +/- 141 microg/min, (P < 0.01). Changes in UAE for valsartan correlated significantly with UAE at baseline (r = -0.935, P < 0.0001). Serum creatinine levels and creatinine clearance remained stable before and after treatment with valsartan. No significant differences were observed between pre- and post-treatment body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin, or systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy, 6 months of treatment with low dose valsartan, an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, thus reduced UAE with no reduction in systemic blood pressure. The drug may be safely administered in this subset of type 2 diabetic patients. The long-term benefits in terms of risk reduction must still be evaluated in further trials.
