Glomerular infiltration of monocytes/macrophages occurs in diabetic patients with nephropathy, and chemokine receptor signals are thought to play a key role in the development of nephropathy. Recently, polymorphism of the chemokine receptor (CCR)2 coding region V64I and the CCR5 promoter region 59029 (G/A) have been identified. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of these genotypes on diabetic nephropathy. CCR2 V64I and CCR5 59029 (G/A) were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism in 401 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a serum creatinine <2.0 mg/dl. Although the CCR2 V64I genotype showed no association with nephropathy, the frequency of the CCR5 59029 A-positive genotype (G/A or A/A) was significantly higher in patients with microalbuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR] > or = 30 and <300 mg/gCre, 86%) and patients with macroalbuminuria (ACR > or = 300 mg/gCre, 87%) than in patients with normoalbuminuria (ACR <30 mg/gCre, 75%; P = 0.0095). Polytomic logistic regression analysis showed that the CCR5 59029 A-positive genotype was associated with nephropathy (odds ratio 2.243, P = 0.0074). These results suggest that the CCR5 promoter 59029 A genotype may be an independent risk factor for diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
