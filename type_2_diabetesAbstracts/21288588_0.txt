Genes for the fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) family encode small 14-15 kDa cytosolic proteins and can be regulated during type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. This study compared association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FABP1-5 with T2DM in different ethnic groups. Associations with T2DM of SNPs in these proteins were assessed in African American (AA), non-Hispanic White (NHW), and Hispanic American (HA) individuals. A total of 650 DNA samples were genotyped; control samples were obtained from Coriell's North American Human Variation Panel Repository (NAHVP) of apparently healthy individuals and T2DM cases were taken from the American Diabetes Association GENNID Study. The rs454550 SNP of FABP5 showed a significant association with T2DM in NHW (OR: 9.03, 95% CI: 1.13-71.73, p=0.014). Our analysis also identified a new FABP5 SNP (nSNP) that showed a significant association with T2DM in NHW (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.19-0.99, p=0.045) and AA (OR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.80, p=0.016). The Ala54Thr FABP2 polymorphism was significantly associated with T2DM in HA individuals only (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.05-3.27, p=0.032). All other FABP SNPs did not show association with T2DM. These findings suggest a potential distinct role(s) of SNPs in FABP5 and FABP2 genes in T2DM in different populations.
