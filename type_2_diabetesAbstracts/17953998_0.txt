The purposes of this study were to determine the incidence rates and predictors of type 2 diabetes and impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFG) among the employees of a university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Totally 2370 and 1619 workers without diabetes and IFG at baseline, respectively, who were +35 years old were followed up during 2001-2005. Type 2 diabetes incidence rates (95% CI) were 13.6 (8.4-22.3) and 6.4 (4.5-9.1) per 1000 PYs, respectively, for men and women, while those of the IFG were 37.8 (26.3-54.4) and 23.6 (19.3-29.0) per 1000 PYs, respectively, for both genders. Baseline FBS predicted future IFG risk even at the levels as low as 63-70 mg/dl. The OR (95% CI) of IFG for those with baseline FPG of 63-70, 71-80, and >80 mg/dl-compared to those with baseline FPG < or =62 mg/dl-were 2.51 (1.12-5.64), 5.39 (2.51-11.56), and 8.30 (3.67-18.75), respectively. Future diabetes risk was observed only in those with baseline FPG of 96 mg/dl or higher, with the OR (95% CI) of 6.0 (2.29-15.75). In conclusion, baseline FPG even at the level as low as 63-70 mg/dl predicts future IFG risk among a hospital employee group in Thailand, while increased diabetes risk was found only in those at the FBS level of > or =96 mg/dl.
