 AIM: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are a novel class of pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes. We investigated the effects of a novel, long-acting human GLP-1 analogue, taspoglutide, in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, an animal model of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Blood glucose and plasma levels of insulin, peptide YY (PYY), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and triglycerides were measured during oral glucose tolerance tests (oGTT) conducted in ZDF rats treated acutely or chronically with a single long-acting dose of taspoglutide. Pioglitazone was used as a positive control in the chronic study. Postprandial glucose, body weight, glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity were assessed over 21 days in chronically treated animals. RESULTS: Acute treatment with taspoglutide reduced glucose excursion and increased insulin response during oGTT. In chronically treated rats, glucose excursion and levels of GIP, PYY and triglycerides during oGTT on day 21 were significantly reduced. Postprandial glucose levels were significantly lower than vehicle controls by day 15. A significant reduction in body weight gain was noticed by day 8, and continued until the end of the study when body weight was approximately 7% lower in rats treated with taspoglutide compared to vehicle. Glycaemic control (increased levels of 1,5-anhydroglucitol) and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index) were improved by taspoglutide treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Taspoglutide showed typical effects of native GLP-1, with improvement in glucose tolerance, postprandial glucose, body weight, glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity.
