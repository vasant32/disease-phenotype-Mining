A low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a key feature of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. HDL particles exert an anti-atherogenic effect, and low HDL-C levels are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. The profile of lipoprotein sub-classes may also be abnormal in patients with the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes, with an excess of atherogenic small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Statins are first-line lipid-modifying drugs that, in addition to varying in their effects on LDL-C, differ in their effects on HDL-C. Rosuvastatin has been shown to be at least as effective at increasing HDL-C compared with atorvastatin, pravastatin or simvastatin. Selecting an agent that will increase HDL-C levels, as well as lowering LDL-C levels, may be particularly beneficial in the treatment of patients with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.
