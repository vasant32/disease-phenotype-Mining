 OBJECTIVES: (1) To measure the proportion of participants who used hypoglycaemic agents provided by CDAP only, for at least 6 months, and attained an HbA1c of <or=7% (a measure of glycaemic control) and (2) to determine the attitudes and practices of patients and pharmacist in this new programme. DESIGN AND METHODS: The attainment of a glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration of <or=7% in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was used as a measure of good glycaemic control. Consequently we measured the HbA1c in 208 subjects who satisfied the entry criteria. Two questionnaires were designed, pre-tested and administered to both patients and pharmacist in the programme to determine their attitudes and practices. RESULTS: Of the 208 eligible participants, 128 (61.5%) were well controlled, 94% of all participants were satisfied with CDAP and only 23.3% of participants experienced one or more minor side effect with the drugs used from CDAP. There were no significant differences between patients who were well controlled and poorly controlled with respect to gender, physical activity and diet. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that CDAP has impacted favorably on the control of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Trinidad, most participants were satisfied with the programme and there were no major adverse effects from the drugs used.
