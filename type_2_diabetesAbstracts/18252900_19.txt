 OBJECTIVE: Intensive lifestyle intervention significantly reduced diabetes incidence among the participants in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study. We investigated whether and to what extent risk factors for type 2 diabetes and other baseline characteristics of the study participants modified the effectiveness of the lifestyle intervention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Overweight, middle-aged volunteers with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention (n = 265) or to a control group (n = 257) for a median of 4 years. Diabetes status was ascertained annually with repeated oral glucose tolerance testing. Incidence rates of diabetes and hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the intervention group with the control group were calculated by sex and baseline tertiles of age, BMI, waist circumference, plasma glucose concentration at fasting and 2 h after a glucose load, fasting serum insulin and insulin resistance index, and categories of composite baseline Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC). Interactions between the intervention assignment and baseline risk factors on diabetes risk were analyzed. RESULTS: The intervention was most effective among the oldest individuals (HRs 0.77, 0.49, and 0.36 by increasing age tertiles, respectively; P(interaction) = 0.0130) and those with a high baseline FINDRISC (HRs 1.09, 0.84, 0.34, and 0.22 by increasing risk score category, respectively; P(interaction) = 0.0400). The effect of the intervention on diabetes risk was not modified by other baseline characteristics or risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The FINDRISC may be useful in identifying high-risk groups most likely to benefit from intensive lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes.
