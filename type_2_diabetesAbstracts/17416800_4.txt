Long before reaching diagnostic cutoff levels for type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose can be a powerful risk marker for this disease. We conducted a genome-wide search for fasting glucose as a quantitative trait in 412 young European sib-pairs including obese children, with adjustment for sex, age, and BMI. We identified more quantitative trait loci specific to fasting glucose and more significant than would be found by simple chance estimated by permutation tests. The strongest linkage was on chromosome 2q (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 3.00) in a region previously linked to type 2 diabetes as a disease. We also found linkage signals of fasting glucose with 7q (LOD = 2.03), 8q (1.28), 17p (2.12), 17q (1.4), and 11p (1.33). These findings suggest that the quantitative genetics of fasting glucose could contribute to the search for type 2 diabetes genes.
