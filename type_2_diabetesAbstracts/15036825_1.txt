A total of 385 drug-therapy na√Øve patients, with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, were randomised into a multinational, parallel-group study to compare two strategies for dose titration of the oral hypoglycaemic agent repaglinide. Patients were allocated to either a fasting blood glucose (FBG) monitoring group with titration target 4.4-6.1 mmol/l or to a post-prandial blood glucose (PPBG) monitoring group with titration target 4.4-8.0 mmol/l. An initial titration period of up to 8 weeks was followed by a 12-week treatment period. Glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic outcomes were compared for the respective groups. HbA(1c) decreased significantly more in the FBG monitoring group by a mean of 1.38% compared to the PPBG group by a mean of 1.22% (P=0.03). The glycaemic control targets were met by fewer patients in the FBG group than in the PPBG group (57% versus 86% (P<0.001)) despite a higher mean dose of repaglinide in the FBG group. The within-patient blood glucose variability was significantly lower in the FBG group than in the PPBG group (P<0.001). In conclusion, repaglinide lowered the HbA(1c) effectively and safely in both groups and self-monitored FBG is a suitable parameter for titration of repaglinide. Whether a lower PPBG target might be as good a guide as FBG for titration of repaglinide should be addressed in a future study.
