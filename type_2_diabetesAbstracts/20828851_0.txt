 AIMS: 1. To determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of persons with type 2 diabetes in the rural community of San Juan, Batangas, Philippines. 2. To determine the association between patient factors such as age, sex, duration of diabetes, and type of diabetes on knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding diabetes. METHODS: Cross-sectional analytic study done among persons with type 2 diabetes in the rural community. Participants were selected using stratified cluster sampling. Data were collected using two main methods: use of investigator-administered questionnaires and focus group discussions (FGDs). RESULTS: 156 diabetic residents were included. The overall mean percentage score on knowledge was 43%. Less than half of the respondents strongly believed in the need for patient autonomy (38%). 35 respondents were included in the FGDs. Only 4 out of 35 diabetic respondents owned a glucose meter while only 16 out of the 35 consult their doctors on a regular basis. CONCLUSIONS: The study comprises Phase I of the proposed 5-year community-based DSME Program in the Philippines. It highlights the importance of evaluating knowledge, attitudes and practices as crucial means to understand observed behaviors and guide behavioral change.
