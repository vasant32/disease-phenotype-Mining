A multi-center prospective study was conducted to assess the function and impact of diabetic education programs on diabetic control. A total of 208 subjects with type 2 diabetes were recruited. Diabetes self-care, assessed by questionnaire, was evaluated before, and 4 months after attending a diabetes education course. A total of 121 subjects who received advanced diabetes education courses were designated as the experimental group. A second group of 87 cases receiving a basic course served as controls. In addition to basic knowledge, the advanced education programs included dietary control, blood glucose monitoring, management of hypoglycemia, medication compliance, foot care and exercise. Diabetes self-care techniques were significantly improved in the experimental group. The overall score for diabetes self-care techniques improved in both groups at the 4th month over baseline values. The change was significant with the controls' (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis confirmed the intensity of diabetic education was the only significant variable correlated with the decrease of fasting blood glucose and systolic blood pressure. In conclusion, integrated and intensive diabetes education program in diabetes education centers provides an effective method for improving diabetes self-care techniques and metabolic outcome.
