 OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the 3-month follow-up data of the Eat Well, Live Well Nutrition Program, a culturally specific, peer-led dietary change program designed to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in low-income African-American women. This peer-led program was delivered in the community and was tailored to the participants' stage of change for individual dietary patterns. We report the results of the 3-month intervention and the extent to which dietary changes and other key outcomes were maintained at a 3-month follow-up assessment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using an experimental control group design, 294 overweight African-American women (ages 25-55 years), recruited in collaboration with a neighborhood organization, completed pre- and posttest and 3-month follow-up interviews of dietary behaviors, knowledge, attitudes, fat intake, and weight. RESULTS: Significant reductions were found in fat intake among women in the treatment condition when compared with women in the control group; these reductions were maintained at 3-month follow-up assessment. Likewise, significant changes in dietary patterns were reported after the study and were maintained, except for one dietary pattern (replacement). CONCLUSIONS: This model of health promotion, which individually tailors dietary patterns through staging and use of peer educators, has the potential for decreasing fat intake and increasing and maintaining specific low-fat dietary patterns among overweight African-American women at risk for diabetes.
