 OBJECTIVE: To determine the functional health status and treatment satisfaction in patients with type 2 diabetes from the Evaluation of Lantus Effect ON Optimization of use of single dose Rapid insulin (ELEONOR) study that investigated whether a telecare program helps optimization of basal insulin glargine with one bolus injection of insulin glulisine. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Functional health status and treatment satisfaction were investigated using the 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) Health Survey, the World Health Organization Well-Being Questionnaire (WBQ), and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 291 randomized patients, 238 completed the study (telecare: 114; self-monitoring blood glucose: 124). Significant improvements were detected in most SF-36 domains, in WBQ depression and anxiety scores, and in treatment satisfaction, without differences between study groups. CONCLUSIONS: An insulin regimen that substantially improves metabolic control, while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia, can positively affect physical and psychologic well-being and treatment satisfaction irrespective of the educational support system used.
