OBJECTIVE: To determine whether teaching free-living subjects with type 2 diabetes how to incorporate added sugars or sweets into their daily meal plan results in a greater consumption of calories (fat or sugar) and deteriorates their glycemic or lipid profiles but improves their perceived quality of life. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In an 8-month randomized controlled trial, 48 free-living subjects with type 2 diabetes were taught either a conventional (C) meal plan (no concentrated sweets) or one permitting as much as 10% of total energy as added sugars or sweets (S). Mean individual nutrient intake was determined using the average of six 24-h telephone recalls per 4 months. Metabolic control and quality of life were evaluated every 2 months. Quality of life was assessed using the Medical Outcome Survey and the Diabetes Quality of Life questionnaire. RESULTS: The S group did not consume more calories (fat or sugar) and in fact ate significantly less carbohydrate (-15 vs. 10 g) and less starch (-7 vs. 8 g) and had a tendency to eat fewer calories (-77 vs. 81 kcal) than the C group. Weight remained stable, and there was no evidence that consuming more sugar worsened metabolic profile or improved their perceived quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Giving individuals with type 2 diabetes the freedom to include sugar in their daily meal plan had no negative impact on dietary habits or metabolic control. Health professionals can be reassured and encouraged to teach the new "sugar guidelines," because doing so may result in a more conscientious carbohydrate consumption.
