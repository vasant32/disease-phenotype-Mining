We aimed to assess the association between adiponutrin gene (ADPN) SNPrs2072907 and obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Chinese population. 500 T2DM and 331 nondiabetic subjects were recruited. No association was found between SNPrs2072907 and obesity or T2DM. ADPN was not an obesity/T2DM susceptibility gene in Chinese population.
