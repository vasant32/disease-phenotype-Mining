 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: A meta-analysis was performed to assess the association between the UCP2 -866G/A, UCP2 Ala55Val and UCP3 -55C/T polymorphisms and type 2 diabetes susceptibility. METHODS: A literature-based search was conducted to identify all relevant studies. The fixed or random effect pooled measure was calculated mainly at the allele level to determine heterogeneity bias among studies. Further analyses were performed that stratified for ethnicity. RESULTS: We examined 17 publications. Stratified analysis for ethnicity and sensitivity analysis revealed that there was no heterogeneity between studies for these variants. Using an additive model, no significant association of the UCP2 -866G/A polymorphism with type 2 diabetes risk was observed, either in participants of Asian (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96, 1.16) or of European (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99, 1.07) descent. Neither the UCP2 Ala55Val nor the UCP3 -55C/T polymorphism showed any significant association with type 2 diabetes risk in Europeans (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98, 1.09 for Ala55Val; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00, 1.09 for -55C/T). In contrast, a statistically significant association was observed for both polymorphisms in participants of Asian descent (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.12, 1.36 for Ala55Val; OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03, 1.28 for -55C/T). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our meta-analysis suggests that the UCP2 -866G/A polymorphism is unlikely to be associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk in the populations investigated. In contrast, our results indicate that the UCP2 Ala55Val and UCP3 -55C/T polymorphisms may indeed be risk factors for susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in individuals of Asian descent, but not in individuals of European descent. This conclusion warrants confirmation by further studies.
