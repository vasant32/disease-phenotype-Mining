In this issue of Diabetologia, two new approaches are described for the assessment of intra-renal blood flow in people with diabetes. The first approach used the technique of dynamic assessment of the resistance index (RI) in the renal interlobar arteries before and after administration of sublingual glyceryl trinitrate, and the second used MRI to assess total renal blood flow in relation to mean arterial pressure, thereby enabling direct measurement of overall renal RI. The results of the first study raise the possibility that dynamic evaluation of the intra-renal RI could be used as an early detector of vascular alterations in type 2 diabetes, before the onset of microalbuminuria. The results of the second study suggest that decreases in renal blood flow in people with longstanding type 1 diabetes reflect intra-renal vascular stiffening and raise the possibility that in microalbuminuric patients it may also reflect increased intraglomerular pressure.
