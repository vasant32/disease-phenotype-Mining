In order to evaluate polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activity in diabetes mellitus, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels were measured in sixty patients, 31 affected with Type 1 diabetes mellitus and 29 affected with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The LTB4 levels (12.1+/-0.2 pg/100 microl) in diabetic patients were higher compared to those of the control group (7.9+/-0.1 pg/100 microl) (P < 0.001), and remained significantly higher (P < 0.001) (12.8+/-0.2 pg/100 microl) than in the control group (11.0+/-0.2 pg/100 microl) after stimulation with calcium ionophore. A significant and positive correlation between glycated hemoglobin and LTB4 was demonstrated (P < 0.001, r = 0.80). This study demonstrates that in diabetic patients there is a PMN activation and that this activation is correlated to glycated hemoglobin level.
