 AIMS: Dapagliflozin, a selective, orally active inhibitor of the renal sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) is in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dapagliflozin were evaluated in healthy Japanese subjects and in Japanese subjects with T2DM. METHODS: Two studies were conducted: a single-ascending dose (SAD) study (2.5-50 mg) in 32 healthy subjects and a multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study (2.5-20 mg QD for 14 days) in 36 subjects with T2DM. Safety and tolerability were assessed in both studies. Single and multiple dose PK of dapagliflozin and its inactive major metabolite, dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, and PD (urinary glucose parameters) were characterized. Plasma glucose parameters were assessed over 14 days in the MAD study. RESULTS: No serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events occurred in either study. In healthy and T2DM subjects, dapagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum plasma concentration of 0.5-1.3 h. Systemic exposure of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, measured by maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve, increased proportional to dose. On a molar basis, systemic exposure to dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide was similar to parent dapagliflozin. There was a dose-related increase in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine (SAD and MAD), which was associated with dose-related decreases in plasma glucose parameters in subjects with T2DM (MAD). CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin was well tolerated and showed predictable dose-proportional PK and PD parameters in both healthy and T2DM Japanese subjects.
