OBJECTIVEType 2 diabetes is a risk factor for other forms of stroke, but its association with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from ruptured saccular intracranial aneurysm (sIA) has remained unclear.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSKuopio Intracranial Aneurysm Database (www.uef.fi/ns) includes all ruptured and unruptured sIA cases from a defined catchment population in eastern Finland since 1980. We compared the age-adjusted incidences of type 2 diabetes in 1,058 ruptured and 484 unruptured sIA patients during 1994-2008, using the national registry of prescribed medicine purchases.RESULTSOf the 1,058 ruptured sIA patients, 43% were males and 57% females, with a median age at rupture of 51 and 56 years, respectively. From 1994 to 2008 or until death, 9% had been prescribed antidiabetes medication (ADM) with a median starting age of 58 years for males and 66 years for females. Of the 484 unruptured sIA patients, 44% were males and 56% females, with a median age at the diagnosis of 53 and 55 years, respectively, and 9% had used ADM, with a median starting age of 61 years for males and 66 years for females. The incidence of type 2 diabetes was highest in the age-group 60-70 years, with no significant differences between the ruptured and unruptured sIA patients.CONCLUSIONSOur study suggests that type 2 diabetes does not increase the risk of rupture of sIA, which is by far the most frequent cause of nontraumatic SAH.
