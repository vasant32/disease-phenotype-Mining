We studied the relationship of slight albuminuria (microalbuminuria) to serum lipid and lipoproteins in a representative group of middle-aged Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients. A random sample of non-diabetic control subjects was also examined. Diabetic patients had both at diagnosis and after five years higher total, LDL- and VLDL-triglyceride levels and higher VLDL-cholesterol, but lower HDL-cholesterol levels than non-diabetic subjects. No consistent difference was found in LDL-cholesterol levels between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The prevalence of microalbuminuria (greater than 35 mg/24h) remained about the same in diabetic patients at both examinations (19-20%). The diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria were slightly hyperglycaemic and they tended to have lower creatinine clearance at the 5-year examination than those without persistent microalbuminuria. There were no differences in the blood pressure levels or the occurrence of hypertension between the diabetic groups with and without microalbuminuria. At the baseline examination, no differences were seen in serum lipids and lipoproteins between diabetic patients with and without microalbuminuria. In patients with persistent microalbuminuria, a statistically significant increase in VLDL-cholesterol (p less than 0.05) and VLDL- and LDL-triglyceride levels (p less than 0.05) and a decrease in HDL-cholesterol level (p less than 0.05) was seen at the 5-year follow-up. These changes could not be explained by age, sex, body mass index or HbA1. In conclusion, persistent microalbuminuria predicts and aggravates abnormalities in lipoprotein composition and a decrease in HDL-cholesterol in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
