Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has been identified as a novel metabolic regulator. This cross-sectional study was performed to clarify how serum FGF21 levels were associated with clinical parameters in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes (n=139). Anthropometric and blood biochemical parameters, uses of drugs for diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia were examined regarding associations with fasting serum FGF21 concentrations. FGF21 levels were 6-times higher in those subjects taking fibrates. However, a use of thiazolidinediones did not affect serum FGF21 levels while it induced higher serum adiponectin levels. In univariate analyses, FGF21 levels showed associations with a use of fibrates, triglyceride levels, creatinine levels, waist circumference, and BMI. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age, gender and BMI showed that a use of fibrates, triglyceride levels and creatinine levels were strong contributors to serum FGF21 levels. In contrast, a use of thiazolidinediones, HDL-cholesterol levels and fasting insulin levels were strong contributors to serum adiponectin levels. This study revealed that serum FGF21 levels were biochemical indicators correlating to a set of essential metabolic parameters, which was distinct from that correlating to serum adiponectin levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
