Hyperleptinemia, hypoadiponectinemia, and hyperresistinemia were found to be significantly higher with odds ratios (CI 95%) of 2.15, 2.05 and 3.05, respectively, among cigarette smokers with type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabian population. Smoking cessation restored the adiponectin and leptin levels while having a modest effect on resistin levels.
