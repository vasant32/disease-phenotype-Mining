 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Metformin is widely used for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus, but its actions are poorly understood. In addition to diminishing hepatic glucose output, metformin, in muscle, activates 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which alone increases glucose uptake and glycolysis, diminishes lipid synthesis, and increases oxidation of fatty acids. Moreover, such lipid effects may improve insulin sensitivity and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Nevertheless, the effects of metformin on insulin-sensitive signalling factors in human muscle have only been partly characterised to date. Interestingly, other substances that activate AMPK, e.g., aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D: -riboside (AICAR), simultaneously activate atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), which appears to be required for the glucose transport effects of AICAR and insulin. METHODS: Since aPKC activation is defective in type 2 diabetes, we evaluated effects of metformin therapy on aPKC activity in muscles of diabetic subjects during hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp studies. RESULTS: After metformin therapy for 1 month, basal aPKC activity increased in muscle, with little or no change in insulin-stimulated aPKC activity. Metformin therapy for 8 to 12 months improved insulin-stimulated, as well as basal aPKC activity in muscle. In contrast, IRS-1-dependent phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity and Ser473 phosphorylation of protein kinase B were not altered by metformin therapy, whereas the responsiveness of muscle aPKC to PI-3,4,5-(PO(4))(3), the lipid product of PI 3-kinase, was improved. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that the activation of AMPK by metformin is accompanied by increases in aPKC activity and responsiveness in skeletal muscle, which may contribute to the therapeutic effects of metformin.
