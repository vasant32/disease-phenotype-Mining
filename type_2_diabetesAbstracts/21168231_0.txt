 AIMS: We evaluate the efficacy of the "Active Body Control (ABC) Program" for weight reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The ABC program combines telemonitoring of the physical activity with a low-calorie diet also preferring carbohydrates with low glycemic indexes. In this 6-month, randomized, clinical trial 35 patients (aged 57 ± 9 years; BMI=35.3 ± 5.7 kg/m(2)) were treated according to the ABC program and 35 control patients (aged 58 ± 7 years; BMI=34.8 ± 5.9 kg/m(2)) received standard therapy. RESULTS: After 6 months the mean weight loss in the intervention group was 11.8 kg ± 8.0 kg. Glucose and HbA1c were lowered by respectively 1.0 mmol/l and 0.8 percentage points (p=0.000, respectively). The proportion of patients with HbA1c>7% fell from 57% to 26%. Antidiabetic drugs were discontinued in 13 patients (39%) and reduced in 14 (42%). The reduction of costs on medication per patient was € 83 in 6 months. In the control group, there were no relevant changes in body weight, laboratory values or drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The ABC program effectively lowers body weight, Hb1Ac and antidiabetic drug use in patients with type 2 diabetes.
