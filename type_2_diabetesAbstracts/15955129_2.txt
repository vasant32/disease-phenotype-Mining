AIM: This study aimed to investigate levels of Homocysteine (tHcy) and folate in a population-based sample of patients with type 2 diabetes. In particular, the study explored modifiable determinants such as treatment for diabetes, life style, glucose control and kidney function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a community-based surveillance of patients with type 2 diabetes, 196 men and 191 women were consecutively identified in primary care and characterized by cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors focusing on components in the metabolic syndrome. For categorical associations plasma tHcy was dichotomized using the upper 10 percentiles of the distribution. RESULTS: Treatment with sulphonylurea was associated with lower serum levels of tHcy compared to those on diet alone. The association was confined to women [odds ratio 0.14; confidence interval 0.03-0.8] and remained significant when differences in factors related to the metabolic syndrome, life style and previous CVD were accounted for, but was lost when adjusted for HbA1c. There was an inverse dose-related association between physical activity and plasma levels of tHcy (men p = 0.006, women p = 0.034), and a positive association with serum levels of creatinine (men p = 0.004, women p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The association with physical activity might be one contributing explanation for its well-known protective effect on cardiovascular disease. The over risk for vascular complications in diabetic patients with kidney disease may be partially explained by high levels of tHcy and should be further explored. Prospective studies are particularly needed on various treatment for type 2 diabetes and tHcy to explore possible implications for clinical procedures and for public health.
