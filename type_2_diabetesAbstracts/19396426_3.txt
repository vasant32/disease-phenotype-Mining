 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Hepatic insulin degradation decreases in type 2 diabetes. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) plays a key role in insulin degradation and its gene is located in a diabetes-associated chromosomal region. We hypothesised that IDE may be regulated by insulin and/or glucose in a liver cell model. To validate the observed regulation of IDE in vivo, we analysed biopsies of human adipose tissue during different clamp experiments in men. METHODS: Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were incubated in normal (1 g/l) or high (4.5 g/l) glucose medium and treated with insulin for 24 h. Catalytic activity, mRNA and protein levels of IDE were assessed. IDE mRNA levels were measured in biopsies of human subcutaneous adipose tissue before and at 240 min of hyperinsulinaemic, euglycaemic and hyperglycaemic clamps. RESULTS: In HepG2 cells, insulin increased IDE activity under normal glucose conditions with no change in IDE mRNA or protein levels. Under conditions of high glucose, insulin increased mRNA levels of IDE without changes in IDE activity. Both in normal and high glucose medium, insulin increased levels of the catalytically more active 15a IDE isoform compared with the 15b isoform. In subcutaneous adipose tissue, IDE mRNA levels were not significantly upregulated after euglycaemic or hyperglycaemic clamps. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Insulin increases IDE activity in HepG2 cells in normal but not in high glucose conditions. This disturbance cannot be explained by corresponding alterations in IDE protein levels or IDE splicing. The loss of insulin-induced regulation of IDE activity under hyperglycaemia may contribute to the reduced insulin extraction and peripheral hyperinsulinaemia in type 2 diabetes.
