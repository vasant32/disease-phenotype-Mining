We tested the association of TCF7L2 variants with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in 691 Lebanese people and 919 controls. rs7901695, rs4506565, rs7903146, rs12243326, rs7895340, and rs12255372 minor allele frequencies were higher in T2DM. Haplotype analysis (rs7901695-rs4506565-rs7903146-rs12243326-rs7895340-rs11196205-rs12255372) identified positively- (2122112, 2222222) and negatively- (1111111) T2DM-associated haplotypes. TCF7L2 is a common T2DM candidate gene in Lebanese people.
