We analyzed the medical records of 884 type 2 DM patients who were taking different antiplatelet agents for more than 2 years. Based on the records, occurrences of cardiovascular events for 10 years were evaluated. The composite disease-free survival rate for cilostazol monotherapy group was similar to aspirin subgroup (p=0.133).
