 OBJECTIVE: Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) are important and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in humans. Recent cross-sectional studies have detected increased concentrations of serum POPs in diabetic patients. We aimed to examine the association between previous high exposures to PCBs and PCDFs and the cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the late 1970s, the consumption of rice-bran oil laced with PCBs poisoned thousands of Taiwanese. Between 1993 and 2003, we examined 1,054 Yucheng ("oil disease") victims against neighborhood reference subjects using a protocol blinded for POP exposure. Here, we report the results derived from 378 Yucheng subjects and 370 matched references. RESULTS: The diabetes risk to members of the Yucheng cohort relative to their reference subjects was significantly increased for women (odds ratio [OR] 2.1 [95% CI 1.1-4.5]) but not for men after considering age, BMI, cigarette smoking, and alcohol intake. Yucheng women diagnosed with chloracne had adjusted ORs of 5.5 (95% CI 2.3-13.4) for diabetes and 3.5 (1.7-7.2) for hypertension compared with those who were chloracne free. CONCLUSIONS: Yucheng women, who had endured previous exposure to PCBs and PCDFs, suffered from increased incidences of diabetes, particularly those who had retained significant levels of pollutant as evident from chloracne. When planning treatments against diabetes, the body burden of PCBs and dioxins should be carefully considered, especially for women.
