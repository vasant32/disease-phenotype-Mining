OBJECTIVE: To examine the factors predicting age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in Hong Kong Chinese. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The relationships between age at diagnosis and parental history of diabetes as well as an array of clinical and metabolic factors were examined using a hospital clinic-based diabetes registry involving 3,414 index patients with type 2 diabetes Patterns of age at diagnosis in successive generations were also examined using 21 affected child-parent pairs and 7 affected child-parent-grandparent trios. RESULTS: Approximately 29% of the index patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at < or = 35 years of age (hereby defined as early-onset). Compared with the patients diagnosed at >35 years of age (hereby defined as late-onset) the early-onset patients had higher rates of positive paternal (16 vs. 5%) and maternal (22 vs. 12%) history of diabetes (both at P < 0.01) and had poorer metabolic profiles. In the overall index patients, male sex, higher HbA1c waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and systolic blood pressure (sBP); lower HDL cholesterol level; and a positive paternal was well as maternal history of diabetes predicted younger age at diagnosis. More senior age and higher BMI and diastolic blood pressure predicted olderq age at diagnosis. Predictors for younger age at diagnosis in the male patients were higher HbA1c and sBP and a positive paternal history of diabetes Predictors for younger age at diagnosis in the female patients were higher HbA1c WHR, and sBP and a paternal as well as maternal history of diabetes. In the affected child parent pairs and clild-parent-grandparent trios there was a decrease in age at diagnosis in successive generations. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that both familial (possibly genetic) and metabolic factors affect the age of onset of type 2 diabetes in the Chinese population. The results also suggest an onset and progression pattern of the disease that is compatible with the phenomenon of anticipation.
