Phagocytosis, bactericidal capacity and some selected parameters of oxygen-dependent bactericidal mechanisms were evaluated in 20 patients with type 2 diabetes being in similar (intermediate) state of metabolic control and in 15 healthy individuals. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from diabetics showed normal ability to phagocytose staphylococci, a decreased Intracellular bacteria killing, the impaired stimulated superoxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and the low intracellular myeloperoxidase activity. The obtained data seem to indicate that the decreased bacterial killing by PMNs isolated from diabetics are partly at least related to an impairment of the oxygen-dependent bactericidal mechanisms. Since none of the diabetic patients suffered from recurrent infection the clinical significance of our finding is still uncertain.
