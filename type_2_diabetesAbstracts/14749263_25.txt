Adiponectin (APM1) is an adipocyte-derived peptide. The APM1 gene is located on chromosome 3q27 and linked to type 2 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes, the adiponectin level in plasma is decreased in comparison to healthy subjects. To identify genetic defects of the APM1 gene that contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, we genotyped 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 106 patients with type 2 diabetes, 325 patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 497 nondiabetic control subjects in Swedish Caucasians by using dynamic allele-specific hybridization (DASH). We found that SNPs -11426(A/G) and -11377(G/C) in the proximal promoter region had significant differences of allele frequencies between type 2 diabetic patients and nondiabetic control subjects (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04, respectively). SNP-11426(A/G) was significantly associated with fasting plasma glucose in type 2 diabetic patients (P = 0.02) and in IGT subjects (P = 0.04), while the patients carrying CC and CG genotypes for SNP-11377(G/C) had a higher BMI than the patients with the GG genotype (P = 0.03). Haplotype analysis of 13 SNPs in the APM1 gene showed that estimates of haplotype frequencies in Swedish Caucasians are similar to those estimated in French Caucasians. However, no significant association of haplotypes with type 2 diabetes and IGT was detected in our study. The present study provides additional evidence that SNPs in the proximal promoter region of the APM1 gene contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.
