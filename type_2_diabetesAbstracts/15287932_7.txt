AIM: This study was designed to examine the therapeutic effect of acarbose on serum triglyceride (TG), free fatty acid (FFA), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron (CM) in the meal tolerance test (MTT) before and after acarbose treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). METHODS: Effects of acarbose on postprandial lipid metabolism were examined in DM2 patients. The subjects with normotriglyceridaemia (TG > or = 1.7 mmol/l, n = 60) were divided to three groups (A, B and C), and DM2 patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (TG > 1.7 mmol/l, n = 20) were designated group D. Group A was a control, and group B was designed to examine the one-dose effect of acarbose (100 mg) on lipid levels in MTT using the balanced food of 400 kcal. In groups C and D, acarbose 300 mg/day was administered for 8 weeks, and MTT with the one-dose acarbose administration was performed. We determined the levels of fasting and postprandial levels of glucose, insulin, FFA and TG-rich lipoproteins such as CM and VLDL. RESULTS: Acarbose treatment lowered plasma glucose levels and insulin secretion. In comparison among study groups A, B and C, acarbose significantly lowered serum TG levels in postprandial state. In group D, after the 8-week acarbose administration, fasting or postprandial FFA, TG and VLDL levels were also lowered. Interestingly, postprandial increase in CM was suppressed by acarbose administration in group B, C or D. CONCLUSIONS: Acarbose lowers postprandial TG and CM levels in DM2 with either normotriglyceridaemia or hypertriglyceridaemia. Improvement of insulin resistance with acarbose may also reduce fasting TG levels in DM2 with hypertriglyceridaemia. Acarbose is a beneficial therapeutic agent to reduce TG levels in DM2 patients, thereby leading to suppression of cardiovascular events.
