The impact of the diabetes epidemic will be staggering in terms of costs to individuals and society. Social educational initiatives are imperative to altering the lifestyle trends that drive the growth of the epidemic. Targeted lifestyle or drug interventions aimed at preventing progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus carry costs and risks that need to be considered in the context of expected benefits, which also need to be carefully defined. In terms of pharmacological intervention as part of a primary prevention programme, the risk/benefit assessment must include the potential for adverse effects in a large population of asymptomatic individuals, a significant proportion of whom would not progress to diabetes in the absence of treatment and in whom impaired glucose regulation may reflect different underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. Improving the balance of risks and benefits in drug interventions will require a greater ability to determine which treatments are likely to safely improve glucose regulation and prevent diabetes and its adverse cardiovascular outcomes in individual patients.
