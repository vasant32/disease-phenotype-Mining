 AIMS: : The aim of this study was to determine serum NT-proBNP and plasma Hcy levels and to explore the relationship between serum NT-proBNP and plasma Hcy levels in type 2 diabetic patients with and without asymptomatic LVDD. METHODS: : NT-proBNP and Hcy levels were measured 31 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. According to echocardiographic data, diabetic patients were divided into two groups: normal LV function or LV diastolic dysfunction. RESULTS: : Serum NT-proBNP levels in diabetic patients with LVDD were significantly higher than in diabetic patients with normal LV function and controls. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for NT-proBNP to separate normal vs. diastolic dysfunction was 0.96 in type 2 diabetic patients. Plasma Hcy levels were significantly higher in both diabetic groups than in controls. Positive correlation was noted between NT-proBNP and Hcy levels in diabetic patients with LVDD (r=0.881, p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: : The correlation between elevated NT-proBNP and Hcy levels in diabetic patients with LVDD suggest an association between homocysteinemia and increased NT-proBNP secretion. Our data indicate that NT-proBNP may be a simple screening tool to select diabetic patients with LVDD requiring further examination with echocardiography.
