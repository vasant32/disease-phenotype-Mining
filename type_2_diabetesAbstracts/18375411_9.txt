 OBJECTIVE: To assess whether sex differences exist in the effective control and medication treatment intensity of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis including 44,893 patients with type 2 diabetes (51% women). End points included uncontrolled CVD risk factors (LDL cholesterol > or =130 mg/dl, systolic blood pressure [SBP] > or =140 mmHg, and A1C > or =8%) and the intensity of medical management in patients with uncontrolled CVD risk factors. Multiple-adjusted odds ratios were calculated after stratification for the presence of CVD (present in 39% of the patients). RESULTS: Women with CVD were less likely to have SBP, LDL cholesterol, and A1C controlled and less likely to receive intensive lipid-lowering treatment. Women without CVD were less likely than men to have LDL cholesterol controlled with no differences in SBP or A1C control. CONCLUSIONS: Women with diabetes and CVD have poorer control of important modifiable risk factors than men and receive less intensified lipid-lowering treatment.
