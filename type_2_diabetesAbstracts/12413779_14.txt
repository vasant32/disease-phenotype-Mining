 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of insulin resistance (IR) and insulin secretion (IS) on the development of diabetes mellitus in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) who underwent lifestyle interventions. METHODS: 284 out of 577 individuals with IGT identified by population-based screening in Da Qing, China, who were randomized to undergo diet change and/or increased physical activity had baseline fasting and 2 h post-load insulin determinations. They were followed for 6 years for the development of diabetes. IR and IS were assessed using calculated indices based on fasting plasma insulin and glucose. The interactions of IR, IS, obesity and plasma glucose and the effects of the lifestyle interventions were evaluated using Cox Proportional Hazards analysis. RESULTS: Both IR and IS were significantly associated with the development of diabetes. Lifestyle interventions were more effective in those with lower IT and higher IS at baseline. Diet plus exercise interventions resulted in significantly lower incidence of diabetes, even after controlling for IR, IS, BMI and 2hrPG. CONCLUSION: Both IR and beta-cell function were predictors of diabetes in Chinese with IGT. Lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of DM and these interventions were more effective in those with less IR.
