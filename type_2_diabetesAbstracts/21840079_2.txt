 OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility of short message service (SMS) usage between the clinic visits and to evaluate its effect on glycemic control in uncontrolled type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 34 cases with type 2 Diabetes were followed after fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The interventional group (n=12) had the same conventional approach of the control group but had two mobile numbers (physician and diabetic educator) provided for the SMS support until their next visit in 3 months. Both groups of age, BMI and the pre-study A1c were comparable. RESULTS: Both groups had a significant reduction in their A1c compared to their baseline visit. However, the interventional group had significantly greater reduction in A1c (p=0.001), 1.16% lower than controls. The service was highly satisfactory to the group. CONCLUSION: The results indicate effectiveness in lowering A1c and acceptance by the patients. Further research and large-scale studies are needed.
