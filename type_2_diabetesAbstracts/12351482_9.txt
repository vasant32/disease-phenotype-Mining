 OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the role of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system and lipids in predicting the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 239 type 2 diabetic participants in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) Study (76 women) aged 50-75 years were examined before fenofibrate intervention. Patients underwent carotid ultrasonography for determination of IMT. IGF-I, IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-3, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), glucose, HbA(1c), and C-peptide were measured in fasting samples. Patients were divided in groups without (n = 168) and with (n = 71) clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). RESULTS: Partial correlations adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and diabetes duration showed an inverse association of IGFBP-1 with C-peptide (r = -0. 24, P = 0.018) and with maximal IMT (r = -0.42, P < 0.001), whereas IGF I and IGFBP-3 correlated positively with several risk-promoting lipid parameters. In linear regression analysis controlling for age, sex, BMI, diabetes duration, and presence or absence of oral antihyperglycemic or insulin medication, determinants of IMT were age, IGFBP-1, pulse pressure, Lp(a), diabetes duration, and insulin treatment. IGFBP-1 persisted in the model for subjects with CVD. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, a decrease in IGFBP-1 is a marker of carotid IMT thickening in patients with type 2 diabetes.
