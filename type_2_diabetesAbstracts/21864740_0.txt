Despite numerous publications according to which insulin promotes atherosclerosis, there are many observations in the last fifteen years suggesting that insulin has antiatherogenic properties. Insulin has vasodilatory, antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects. A good glycemic control contributes to the maximum efficiency of antiatherogenic action of insulin. Insulin resistance promotes the atherosclerotic process because of diminished insulin action and not because of hyperinsulinemia, since insulin secretion is getting lower during the years in type 2 diabetes.
