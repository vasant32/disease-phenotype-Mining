We studied the weight-sparing effect and treatment satisfaction when switching from NPH to insulin detemir in type 2 diabetes. Mean HbA(1c) (P<0.05) and waist circumference (P<0.05) were reduced while treatment satisfaction improved (P<0.03). No weight gain was observed. Detemir improves glycemic control, treatment satisfaction, and may provide additional weight-sparing benefits.
