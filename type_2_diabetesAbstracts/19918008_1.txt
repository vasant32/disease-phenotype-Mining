 OBJECTIVE: To validate a low-cost tool for identifying diabetic patients in rural areas of Latin America. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A regression equation incorporating postprandial time and a random plasma glucose was used to screen 800 adults in Honduras. Patients with a probability of diabetes of > or =20% were asked to return for a fasting plasma glucose (FPG). A random fifth of those with a screener-based probability of diabetes <20% were also asked to return for follow-up. The gold standard was an FPG > or =126 mg/dl. RESULTS: The screener had very good test characteristics (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.89). Using the screening criterion of > or =0.42, the equation had a sensitivity of 74.1% and specificity of 97.2%. CONCLUSIONS: This screener is a valid measure of diabetes risk in Honduras and could be used to identify diabetic patients in poor clinics in Latin America.
