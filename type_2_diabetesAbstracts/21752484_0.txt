The aim of this study was to examine the possible association between serum ceruloplasmin, a copper carrying protein, and albuminuria in 456 males with type 2 diabetes. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that elevated serum ceruloplasmin was a determinant of albuminuria independently of conventional risk factors.
