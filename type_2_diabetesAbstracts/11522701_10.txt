OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of type 2 diabetes between low-income Mexican-Americans residing in San Antonio, Texas, and low-income residents in Mexico City, Mexico. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from the San Antonio Heart Study and the Mexico City Diabetes Study, we compared the incidence of type 2 diabetes in 35- to 64-year-old low-income Mexican-American residents of San Antonio with similarly aged low-income residents of Mexico City. Because of the different follow-up times in the two studies, Poisson regression was used to compare the rates of diabetes. Potential risk factors for diabetes were also analyzed to determine whether they explained or contributed to a difference in incidence. RESULTS: The age- and sex-adjusted incidence of type 2 diabetes was significantly higher in San Antonio (RR 2.01) compared with Mexico City. This difference was seen primarily in the oldest age group (55-64 years of age) and remained statistically significant after adjusting for a number of diabetes risk factors, including demographic, anthropometric, and metabolic variables. Follow-up rates were similar in both cities. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there was a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes in San Antonio than in Mexico City, and that difference occurred primarily in individuals in the oldest age group. The potential mediating factors we examined did not account for this difference. Other factors, such as exercise and diet, which were not available for analysis in this study, in addition to a cohort effect, may have contributed to the difference in incidence of type 2 diabetes in the two cities. In addition, there was no evidence of a higher case fatality among diabetic individuals from Mexico City compared with San Antonio.
