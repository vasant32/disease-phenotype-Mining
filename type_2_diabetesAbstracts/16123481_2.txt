 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this randomized controlled study was to determine the effects of biofeedback and relaxation on blood glucose and HbA1c (A1C) in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to either 10 sessions of biofeedback (electromyograph and thermal) and relaxation or 3 sessions of education. All sessions were individual. A total of 39 participants were entered, and 30 completed the 3-month protocol. Average blood glucose, A1C, forehead muscle tension, and peripheral skin temperature were assessed, and inventories measuring depression and anxiety were administered pre-randomization and after completion of treatment/control. RESULTS: Biofeedback and relaxation were associated with significant decreases in average blood glucose, A1C, and muscle tension compared with the control group. At 3-month follow-up, the treatment group continued to demonstrate lower blood glucose and A1C. Both groups decreased scores on the depression and anxiety inventories. Patients with depression had higher blood glucose levels and tended to drop out of the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of biofeedback and relaxation in patients with type 2 diabetes for up to 3 months after treatment. Further research is necessary to determine the long-term effects of biofeedback and the effects of mood on patients' responses to treatment.
