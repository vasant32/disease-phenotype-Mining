 OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of intraday glucose variability (GV) on cardiovascular outcomes in a reanalysis of Hyperglycemia and Its Effect After Acute Myocardial Infarction on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (HEART2D) study data. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients after acute myocardial infarction were randomized to an insulin treatment strategy targeting postprandial (PRANDIAL; n = 557) or fasting/interprandial (BASAL; n = 558) hyperglycemia. GV was calculated as mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), mean absolute glucose (MAG) change, and SD. RESULTS: The PRANDIAL strategy resulted in an 18% lower MAG than BASAL (mean [SEM] difference 0.09 [0.04] mmol/L/h, P = 0.02). In addition, MAGE and SD were lower in the PRANDIAL group, however, not significantly. HbA(1c) levels and cardiovascular event rates were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: A PRANDIAL strategy demonstrated lower intraday GV vs. a BASAL strategy with similar overall glycemic control but did not result in a reduction in cardiovascular outcomes. This does not support the hypothesis that targeting GV would be beneficial in reducing subsequent secondary cardiovascular events.
