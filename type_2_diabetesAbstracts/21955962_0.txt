 AIMS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact on dietary and activity habits of a non-intensive, community based lifestyle intervention for type 2 diabetes prevention, in high-risk Greek individuals. METHODS: A total of 191 high-risk persons were invited to participate in a one-year lifestyle intervention program, consisting of six bi-monthly sessions with a dietician. The dietary aims of the intervention were: reduction of saturated fat, sugars and refined cereals intake and at least five servings of fruits and vegetables, daily. Demographic, dietary, anthropometric, medical and biochemical indices were recorded at baseline and at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention was completed by 126 participants. At study end, participants reported decreased whole fat dairies and processed meats consumption (p=0.018 and 0.016, respectively), sugars (p=0.006) and refined cereals (p=0.045). Participants who improved their diet, decreased body weight (p=0.040), plasma triglycerides (p=0.020) and 2-h post-load plasma glucose (p=0.05) compared to those who had worsened their dietary habits. Total time spent daily on physical activity, remained unchanged throughout the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a group-based, non-intensive dietary counseling proved to be practical and feasible in "real-world" community settings and was accompanied by favorable dietary changes and health benefits.
