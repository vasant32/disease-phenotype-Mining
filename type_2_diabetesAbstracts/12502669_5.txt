 OBJECTIVE: ACE inhibitors are known to be effective in preventing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is reported to contribute to intrarenal hemodynamic abnormality in diabetic patients. We examined whether RAS blockade by captopril induces intrarenal hemodynamic changes in normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The patients ranged in age from 40 to 65 years (20 men and 20 women). A total of 15 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals served as control subjects. Resistive index (RI) of interlobar arteries was examined by duplex Doppler sonography before and after the oral captopril (25 mg) test. RESULTS: At baseline, no significant differences in RI values or plasma renin activity (PRA) were seen between the patients and healthy subjects. In healthy subjects, the RI values after the captopril test were significantly higher than baseline values (P < 0.01). However, in patients with type 2 diabetes, both with normoalbuminuria and microalbuminuria, RI values after the test were significantly lower than baseline values (P < 0.001). There were significant negative correlations between DeltaRI value and HbA1c (r = -0.458, P < 0.005) and between DeltaRI value and baseline PRA in diabetic patients (r = -0.339, P < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that HbA1c and baseline PRA significantly and independently affected the magnitude of decrease in RI values after captopril administration in diabetic patients (R2 = 0.391, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the intrarenal RAS may be activated in diabetic patients, that such activation may be affected by poor glycemic control, and that blockade of RAS activation by ACE inhibitor reduces intrarenal vascular resistance in diabetic patients. The results emphasize the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition in improving intrarenal hemodynamics in diabetic patients.
