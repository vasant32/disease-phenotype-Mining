Saxagliptin (Onglyza™) is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. This open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study in 20 healthy female subjects investigated the effect of saxagliptin on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the active components of a combined oral contraceptive (COC). Subjects received either COC (Ortho-Cyclen®) QD for 21 days, then 5 mg saxagliptin QD + COC QD for 21 days, or vice versa. Coadministration of saxagliptin and COC did not alter the steady-state PK of the primary active estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) or progestin (norelgestromin) COC components. The area under the concentration time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C(max) ) of an active metabolite of norelgestromin (norgestrel) were increased by 13% and 17%, respectively, a magnitude that was not considered clinically meaningful. Coadministration of saxagliptin and COC in this study was generally well tolerated. Saxagliptin can be co-prescribed with an estrogen/progestin combination for women taking oral contraceptive.
