Repaglinide is a novel, rapid-acting prandial glucose regulator. To investigate the effect of repaglinide, 1 mg before each meal, in maintaining glycaemic control in Type 2 diabetic patients who either miss a meal or have an extra meal, 25 patients were randomized to either a fixed-meal regimen of three meals/day or one of two mixed-meal regimens consisting of repeating patterns of two, three or four meals/day over a 20-day period. On the 21st day each patient received three meals. Overall glycaemic control was assessed by weekly serum fructosamine concentrations and 13-point and 37-point serum glucose profiles. Mean fructosamine concentrations decreased significantly to normal values during the treatment period (from 3.10 to 2.68 mg/dl on the fixed-meal regimen and from 3.37 to 2.85 mg/dl on the mixed-meal regimens; P < 0.05), with no statistically significant difference in glucose control between the fixed-meal and mixed-meal regimen groups. Fasting serum glucose levels decreased slightly in both groups, but were not altered by the number of meals consumed. Similarly, serum glucose profiles were not altered significantly by the number of meals consumed. Repaglinide was well tolerated, and no hypoglycaemic events were reported. Serum cholesterol levels were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) in both the fixed-meal and mixed-meal groups, as were triglyceride levels in the mixed-meal group (P < 0.05). It was concluded that meal-associated treatment with repaglinide was well tolerated irrespective of the number of meals consumed/day. Thus, since missing or postponing a meal is a realistic scenario for many individuals, repaglinide offers an oral anti-diabetic treatment which can be adjusted to suit each individual's lifestyle.
