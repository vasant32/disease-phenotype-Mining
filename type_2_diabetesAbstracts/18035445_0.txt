We conducted a study to examine an association between relaxin, insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in women with type 2 diabetes. Relaxin concentration was measured in plasma in 63 newly diagnosed women with type 2 diabetes. We also measured body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, parameters of metabolic control (fasting glucose level, HbA1c, total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides) and insulin resistance according to the homeostasis model assessment index 2 (HOMA2). Relaxin was positively related to insulin sensitivity (R=0.316 and p=0.01) and negatively to beta-cell (-0.382 and p=0.004) function. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the correlation between relaxin and HOMA2%B remained significant after adjustment for age, BMI (R(2)=0.253 and p=0.006). Our data raise the possibility that a gender-related hormonal mechanism may influence beta-cell function in women with type 2 diabetes.
