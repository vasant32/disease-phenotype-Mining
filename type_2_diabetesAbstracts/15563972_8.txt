This study aimed to elucidate the prevalence and clinical risk factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) in Japanese male diabetics. Questionnaires were administered to 82 male diabetics and 25 male non-diabetics (controls), to determine the international index of erectile function (IIEF). This index consists of five parts, with questions related to erectile function (EF), intercourse satisfaction (IS), orgasmic function (OF), sexual desire (SD), and overall satisfaction (OS). IIEF scores were compared between diabetics and controls, and were also analyzed in relation to clinical factors. Although EF, IS, and OF scores (physical factors) in diabetic men were significantly lower than those of age-matched controls, no significant differences were apparent in SD and OS scores (psychological factors). All patients with EF score > or = 18 reported being able to achieve sexual intercourse, we determined the criterion for ED as EF < 18. The prevalence of ED in diabetics and age-matched controls was 60% and 20%, respectively. EF score decreased with duration of diabetes and progression of retinopathy, proteinuria, ischemic heart disease, delayed nerve conduction, orthostatic intolerance, and attenuated heart rate variability. ED was found to be common in Japanese male diabetics. Possible influences of both microangiopathy and macroangiopathy on ED are suggested.
