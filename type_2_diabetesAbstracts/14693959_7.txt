 OBJECTIVE: To describe decisions made by primary care providers on elevated HbA(1c) results and their reasons for not intensifying therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a provider survey was administered in two practice-based research networks when HbA(1c) results were reviewed on all nonpregnant patients >18 years old with type 2 diabetes. Univariate and Mantel-Hantel analyses assessed associations between patient characteristics and clinical decisions. RESULTS: A total of 483 surveys were completed by at least 88 providers at 19 clinics. Most patients were female (62.5%), mean age was 60 years, and 28.6% were Hispanic. The overall action rate on HbA(1c) results >/=7% (n = 294) was 70.7%. Patients who were black or had Medicare without medication insurance had lower rates of action on HbA(1c) >/=7 and >/=8%, respectively (P < 0.05). The most common reasons providers reported for inaction were "patient improving/doing well," "competing demands," and "hypoglycemic risk." CONCLUSIONS: Primary care providers generally adhere to national glycemic control guidelines, although there may be disparities in black patients and patients without medication insurance coverage. A variety of reasons were given when control was not intensified.
