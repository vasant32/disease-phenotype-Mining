 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of common adiponectin gene polymorphisms on dietary intervention-mediated changes in adiponectin levels and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indexes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 363 subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes followed a dietary intervention (replacement of cooked refined rice with whole grains and an increase in vegetable intake) and regular walking for 12 weeks without any medication. Adiponectin gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (45, 276, and -11377) were examined in these subjects. RESULTS: After this dietary intervention, fasting glucose levels decreased in all three SNP 45T>G genotype groups. Subjects with the SNP 45TT genotype showed increased adiponectin levels and decreased HOMA-IR indexes. Haplotype analysis revealed that homozygous carriers of the TG haplotype (45TT and 276GG) and heterozygous carriers of the TG haplotype (TG/X) showed a reduction in the HOMA-IR index after adjustment for baseline levels. Significant differences were observed in changes in HOMA-IR indexes and adiponectin concentrations according to the 45-276 TG haplotype in overweight-obese, but not in normal-weight subjects: the greatest decrease in HOMA-IR indexes and the greatest increase in adiponectin levels were shown in overweight-obese subjects with the TG/TG haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: ADIPOQ genetic variants can affect circulating adiponectin levels and insulin resistance indexes in subjects with IFG or newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in response to dietary intervention.
