Sulphonylureas are effective and well tolerated in patients with Type 2 diabetes, but may be associated with weight gain, and lack of compliance due to multiple daily dosing. This open, uncontrolled surveillance study examined the efficacy and safety of glimepiride, a new sulphonylurea, administered once daily in patients with Type 2 diabetes. A total of 1,770 patients were enrolled in the study, and 284 patients were selected for follow-up. Patients received 0.5 to >4 mg glimepiride once daily for 1.5 years. HbA(1c) was reduced from 8.4% at baseline to 7.1% after 4 months and 6.9% after 1 and 1.5 years (median intra-individual change from baseline: -1.4, -1.5, and -1.7%, respectively; P<0.0001). Treatment with glimepiride also resulted in significant and stable weight loss relative to baseline, with the exception of patients with a body mass index of <25 kg/m(2). Mean body weight was reduced from 79.8 kg at baseline to 77.9 kg after 4 months, 77.2 kg after 1 year, and 76.9 kg after 1.5 years (mean intra-individual change from baseline: -1.9 kg, P<0.0001; -2.9 kg, P<0.05; -3.0 kg, P<0.005, respectively). Therefore, once daily glimepiride provides effective glycaemic control, and may have advantages over other sulphonylureas, because it exhibits weight neutralizing/reducing effects in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
