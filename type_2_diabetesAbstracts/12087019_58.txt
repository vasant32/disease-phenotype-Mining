 OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of a atorvastatin-fenofibrate combination on lipid profile, in comparison to each drug alone, in patients with type 2 diabetes and combined hyperlipidemia (CHL). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 120 consecutive patients, who were free of coronary artery disease (CAD) at entry, were studied for a period of 24 weeks. These patients were randomly assigned to atorvastatin (20 mg/day, n = 40), micronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day, n = 40), or a combination of both (atorvastatin 20 mg/day plus fenofibrate 200 mg/day, n = 40). The effect of treatment on LDL cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I and B, lipoprotein(a), and plasma fibrinogen (PF) was recorded. Moreover, the percentage of patients that reached the American Diabetes Association treatment goals and the estimated CAD risk status were calculated. RESULTS: No patient was withdrawn from the study because of side effects. The atorvastatin-fenofibrate combination reduced total cholesterol by 37%, LDL cholesterol by 46%, TGs by 50%, and PF by 20%, whereas it increased HDL cholesterol by 22% (P < 0.0001 for all). These changes were significantly better than those of both monotherapies. Of the patients on drug combination, 97.5% reached the LDL cholesterol treatment goal of <100 mg/dl, 100% reached the desirable TG levels of <200 mg/dl, and 60% reached the optimal HDL cholesterol levels of >45 mg/dl. These rates were significantly higher than those of both monotherapies. Combined treatment reduced the 10-year probability for myocardial infarction from 21.6 to 4.2%. CONCLUSIONS: The atorvastatin-fenofibrate combination has a highly beneficial effect on all lipid parameters and PF in patients with type 2 diabetes and CHL. It improved patients' CAD risk status significantly more than each drug alone.
