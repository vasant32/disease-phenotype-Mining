 BACKGROUND: Our aim is to review the effectiveness of EBM tools available to primary care professionals to improve the quality of Type 2 diabetes disease management. METHODS: A systematic review of RCT was performed according to the Cochrane methods. RESULTS: Starting from an overall number of 1737 references found, a total of 13 studies met all the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The adherence to EBM instruments is likely to improve process of care, rather than patient outcomes. In addition, our review outlines that feedback reports and use of ICT devices are likely to be effective in diabetes disease management.
