 OBJECTIVE: Alteration in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in diabetic hearts and its effect on cytoprotective signaling are unclear. Here, we examine the hypothesis that ER stress in diabetic hearts impairs phospho-glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta-mediated suppression of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, compromising myocardial response to cytoprotective signaling. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A rat model of type 2 diabetes (OLETF) and its control (LETO) were treated with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) (100 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1) for 7 days), an ER stress modulator. Infarction was induced by 20-min coronary occlusion and 2-h reperfusion. RESULTS: Levels of ER chaperones (GRP78 and GRP94) in the myocardium and level of nonphoshopho-GSK-3beta in the mitochondria were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats. TUDCA normalized levels of GRP78 and GRP94 and mitochondrial GSK-3beta in OLETF rats. Administration of erythropoietin (EPO) induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta and reduced infarct size (% risk area) from 47.4 +/- 5.2% to 23.9 +/- 3.5% in LETO hearts. However, neither phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta nor infarct size limitation was induced by EPO in OLETF rats. The threshold for mPTP opening was significantly lower in mitochondria from EPO-treated OLETF rats than in those from EPO-treated LETO rats. TUDCA restored responses of GSK-3beta, mPTP opening threshold, and infarct size to EPO receptor activation in OLETF rats. There was a significant correlation between mPTP opening threshold and phospho-GSK-3beta-to-total GSK-3beta ratio in the mitochondrial fraction. CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of protective signals leading to GSK-3beta phosphorylation and increase in mitochondrial GSK-3beta are dual mechanisms by which increased ER stress inhibits EPO-induced suppression of mPTP opening and cardioprotection in diabetic hearts.
