 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 diabetes and obesity are associated with increased risk of site-specific cancers. We have investigated whether metabolic alterations at the level of adipose-derived differentiating cells may affect specific phenotypes of breast cancer cells. METHODS: Growth profiles of breast cancer cell lines were evaluated in co-cultures with differentiated adipocytes or their precursor cells and upon treatment with adipocyte conditioned media. Production and release of cytokines and growth factors were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and multiplex-based ELISA assays. RESULTS: Co-cultures with either differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 or human mammary adipocytes increased viability of MCF-7 cells to a greater extent, when compared with their undifferentiated precursors. Adipocytes cultured in 25 mmol/l glucose were twofold more effective in promoting cell growth, compared with those grown in 5.5 mmol/l glucose, and activated mitogenic pathways in MCF-7 cells. Growth-promoting action was also enhanced when adipocytes were incubated in the presence of palmitate or oleate. Interestingly, 3T3-L1 and human adipocytes released higher amounts of keratinocyte-derived chemokine/IL-8, the protein 'regulated upon activation, normally T expressed, and secreted' (RANTES), and IGF-1, compared with their precursor cells. Their levels were reduced upon incubation with low glucose and enhanced by fatty acids. Moreover, both undifferentiated cells and differentiated adipocytes from obese individuals displayed about twofold higher IGF-1 release and MCF-7 cell growth induction than lean individuals. Finally, inhibition of the IGF-1 pathway almost completely prevented the growth-promoting effect of adipocytes on breast cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: IGF-1 release by adipocytes is regulated by glucose and fatty acids and may contribute to the control of cancer cell growth in obese individuals.
