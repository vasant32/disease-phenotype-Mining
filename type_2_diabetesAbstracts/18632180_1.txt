 AIMS: We investigated the relationship of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in Asian. METHODS: A total of 446 subjects (187 without diabetes and 259 with type 2 diabetes) were enrolled in this study. The components of metabolic syndrome, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and UAE were assessed. Based on metabolic syndrome and diabetes status, participants were categorized into one of the following groups: neither metabolic syndrome nor diabetes (MS-DM-), metabolic syndrome without diabetes (MS+DM-), diabetes without metabolic syndrome (MS-DM+) and both metabolic syndrome and diabetes (MS+DM+). RESULTS: The UAE in the MS+DM- group was higher than that in the MS-DM- group (P<0.001) and lower than that in the MS+DM+ group (P<0.001), but not significantly different from that in the MS-DM+ group (P=0.349). The trend of increasing UAE in these four groups was independent of hs-CRP. CONCLUSION: UAE was lowest in subjects with neither metabolic syndrome nor diabetes and highest in subjects with both metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes; however, there was no significant difference between the metabolic syndrome alone group and the type 2 diabetes alone group.
