 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of insulin sensitivity and muscle fibre composition to exercise capacity in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). METHODS: Thirty-nine male patients with T2D, 44 male subjects with IGT and 58 subjects with NGT matched for age, weight and body mass index (BMI) participated in the study. Insulin sensitivity was obtained with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, muscle fibre distribution with a biopsy and exercise capacity from an incremental exercise test. Anthropometric measurements as height, weight, waist and hip circumference were performed. RESULTS: There were small differences between groups in waist hip ratio (WHR) with significance attained between NGT and T2D. There was a progressive reduction in exercise capacity, both expressed as VO(2peak) and work rate from subjects with NGT to IGT to T2D. Multiple regression analysis with VO(2peak) as dependent variable showed insulin sensitivity to be the most important factor followed by Type I fibres. WHR and capillary density also influenced the variance of VO(2peak). CONCLUSION: Exercise capacity is independently related to insulin sensitivity, muscle fibre composition and WHR in subjects with NGT, IGT and T2D who are matched for age and BMI.
