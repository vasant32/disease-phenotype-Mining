The PRESENT study was a 6-month multinational observational study in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30). Data from PRESENT were analysed according to predefined subgroups stratified by age, body mass index (BMI) and ethnic origin. Achieved HbA1c levels were similar in each of: four age subgroups (<40 years 7.82%, 40-50 years 7.70%, 50-60 years 7.75%, >or=65 years 7.75%); five BMI subgroups (<25 kg/m(2): 7.78%, 25-30 kg/m(2): 7.58%, 30-35 kg/m(2): 7.57%, 35-40 kg/m(2): 7.74%, >or=40 kg/m(2): 7.93%); and Asian/Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern/Asian, White ethnic-origin subgroups (7.78%, 7.40%, 7.59%, respectively). The Black ethnic-origin subgroup had a higher baseline HbA1c of 11.61% (other groups 9.29-9.63%) and achieved a final HbA1c of 8.59%. Major hypoglycaemia was reported by fewer than 1% of subjects in any subgroup at end of study; overall end of study hypoglycaemia rates were less than four events/subject year (all subgroups). In conclusion, data from subgroups in the PRESENT study indicate that BIAsp 30 can be initiated and titrated effectively to help patients of all ages, of all degrees of obesity, and from a variety of ethnic origins, to achieve clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control with low rates of hypoglycaemia.
