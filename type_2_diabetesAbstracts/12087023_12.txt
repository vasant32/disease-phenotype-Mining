 OBJECTIVE: The effects of drinking alcohol on atherosclerotic risks were investigated in 194 type 2 diabetic patients to determine whether drinking alcohol influences risk of atherosclerosis in diabetic subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The subjects were divided by the degree of their average weekly alcohol consumption into three groups: nondrinkers, light drinkers (ethanol consumption <210 g/week), and heavy drinkers (ethanol consumption > or = 210 g/week). The degree of atherosclerotic progression was evaluated using aortic pulse wave velocity (a-PWV), and possible atherosclerotic risks were evaluated using known atherosclerotic risk factors. RESULTS: a-PWV was significantly lower in light drinkers than in nondrinkers and heavy drinkers, but there was no significant difference in a-PWV between nondrinkers and heavy drinkers. Systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were significantly higher in heavy drinkers than in nondrinkers and light drinkers, whereas there was no significant difference in these levels between nondrinkers and light drinkers. The mean levels of BMI and blood HbA(1c), uric acid, and fibrinogen were not different between the three groups. There were significant positive correlations of a-PWV with age and systolic blood pressure and weak but significant negative correlations of a-PWV with alcohol consumption and HDL cholesterol level. CONCLUSIONS: Light drinking, but not heavy drinking, has preventive effects on atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic subjects. The known beneficial effects of drinking alcohol on blood lipids and fibrinogen may not be involved in the preventive effect of light drinking on atherosclerosis in diabetic subjects.
