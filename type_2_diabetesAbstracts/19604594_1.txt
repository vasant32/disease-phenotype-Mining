Diabetic peripheral neuropathy differs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate how signs and symptoms of neuropathy correlated with defects in motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity (MCV and SCV) and sensory perception thresholds in patients with type 1 diabetes. MCV and SCV in peroneal and sural nerves and vibratory, warm and cold perception thresholds (VPT, WPT, CPT) were evaluated in the lower limbs of 127 patients (42+/-7.9 years old, duration of diabetes, 16+/-11 years and HbA1c, 7.7+/-1.4%). The results were compared with clinical findings (neuropathy impairment assessment, NIA) and sensory symptoms (neurological symptom assessment, NSA). Sensory symptoms were present in 24% of patients, 91% had at least one abnormal finding in the neurological examination and 84% had abnormal nerve conduction. The greatest deviation from normal was observed for CPT on the dorsum of the foot and peroneal MCV. NIA and NSA correlated with all electrophysiological measurements in the foot and big toe. It is concluded that clinical findings correlate well with electrophysiological abnormalities in patients with type 1 diabetic neuropathy. An elevated CPT for the foot was the most pronounced sensory defect.
