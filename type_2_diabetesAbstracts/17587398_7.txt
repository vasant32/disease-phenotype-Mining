AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of nateglinide vs. repaglinide in blood glucose (BG) control and the effect on insulin resistance and beta-Cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A randomized controlled double-blind and double-dummy multicentre clinical trial was conducted. A total of 230 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in five clinical centres. The patients were divided randomly into group A [repaglinide 1.0 mg three times daily (t.i.d.), n = 115] or group B (nateglinide 90 mg t.i.d., n = 115). At baseline and end of the 12-week clinical trial, standard mixed meal tolerance tests were performed. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients (96.9%) completed the trial. There was no significant difference between repaglinide and nateglinide groups in the effects of reducing fasting blood glucose (FBG), 30-, 60- and 120-min BG during 12 weeks (p > 0.05). At week 12, no significant difference was shown between the two groups in BG or haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) (p > 0.05). However, the effect on HbA(1c) in repaglinide group was stronger than that in nateglinide group (p < 0.05). After 12-week treatment, area under the curve (AUC) of BG decreased (p < 0.05), and AUC of insulin and C-peptide (CP) increased in both groups (p < 0.05). The effects of nateglinide on AUC of BG, insulin and CP were similar to that of repaglinide (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in AUC of BG, insulin or CP in week 12 (p > 0.05). Furthermore, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function indexes measured by HOMA-beta, DeltaI(30)/DeltaG(30) and (DeltaI(30)/DeltaG(30))/HOMA-IR were improved significantly in both groups during 12 weeks (p < 0.05). The effects of improving HOMA-IR and beta-cell function indexes in nateglinide group were comparable with that of repaglinide group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of repaglinide and nateglinide in FBG, postprandial glucose excursion and early-phase insulin secretion is similar. But the effect of repaglinide 1.0 mg t.i.d. on HbA(1c) is stronger than that of nateglinide 90 mg t.i.d.. This trial had shown that nateglinide and repaglinide could comparably improve insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function.
