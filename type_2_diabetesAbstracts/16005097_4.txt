 OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and chronic diabetic complications in early (EOD) and late onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (LOD) in Asia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospective collection of information (basic patient data, treatment received for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, clinical measurements, complications, life-style management, etc.) on paper form and prospective collection of blood samples for HbA(1c) assessment were performed. Means, proportions and associated factors were analyzed using non-parametric and logistic regression. RESULTS: The frequency of EOD (<30 years) varies in different Asian countries (0.4-5.3%). Overweight (BMI>or=23 kg/m2) was common in both EOD (60%) and LOD (66%). EOD was characterized by significantly higher levels of HbA(1c) (median 8.9% versus 7.9%) and FPG (median 9.8 mmol/L versus 8.3 mmol/L) but hypertension was less common (43% versus 59%). Lipid profiles (cholesterol and triglycerides) were similar between both groups of patients. Cataract was more common in LOD and was associated with onset age and diabetes duration whereas an increase in frequency of advanced eye disease, retinopathy and history of photocoagulation was found in EOD cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to diabetic control and duration of the disease, the onset age conferred risk to certain subsets of chronic complications in type 2 diabetes population.
