BACKGROUND: The presence of diabetes in pregnancy can result in substantial morbidity to both mother and baby if management is sub-optimal. AIMS: To assess the process of standards of preconception care (against the National Service Framework standards) of women attending the adult general diabetes clinics in a district general hospital. METHODS: Retrospective review of case notes of women aged 18-40 years attending the general diabetes clinics for annual review, over a period of 6 months. RESULTS: Seventy sets of notes were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 32 years. Fifty-six patients had type-1 diabetes and 14 patients had type-2 diabetes. Mean duration of diabetes was 13 years. Eighty-six percent of the patients had blood pressure recordings documented. Mean blood pressure was 124/74 mmHg. Mean HbA1c was 9.1%. Documented evidence of home blood glucose monitoring was seen in 66% of the patients. Preconception counselling/contraception were discussed in 17 patients (25%). Twenty-nine patients (41%) were on potentially teratogenic medications. Alcohol and smoking history was not documented in 91% and 61% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective assessment highlights that reproductive issues in an at risk population of women with diabetes are not included in routine management of diabetes care in outpatient clinics.
