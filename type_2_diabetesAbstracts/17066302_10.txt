AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The association between depression and insulin resistance has been investigated in only a few studies, with contradictory results reported. The aim of this study was to determine whether the association between symptoms of depression and insulin resistance varies across glucose tolerance status and between men and women. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data from a population-based cohort study in Hoorn, a medium-sized town in the Netherlands, were analysed. The study sample consisted of 541 men and women aged 55-75 years, of whom 260 had NGT, 164 had IGT and 117 had established type 2 diabetes mellitus. Main outcome measures were insulin resistance defined by the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and symptoms of depression using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). RESULTS: In the total sample, we found a weak positive correlation between the depressive symptoms CED-D scores and HOMA-IR scores (r (s) = 0.156, p < 0.001). Even weaker associations were found in subjects with NGT (r (s) = 0.041, p=0.509), in subjects with IGT (r (s) = 0.112, p = 0.160) and in subjects with type 2 diabetes (r (s) = 0.007, p = 0.942). The association between depressive symptoms and insulin resistance was similar for men and women. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We found only weak associations between depressive symptoms and insulin resistance, which did not differ among different glucose metabolism subgroups or between men and women.
