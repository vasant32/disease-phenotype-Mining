 AIMS: To determine risk factors, prognostic, value prevention of development of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively analyzed the incidence of CIN developed after PCI in 151 patients T2DM and 50 patients without diabetes. All patients were subjected to thorough clinical examination (including serum creatinine level before and 48 hours after intervention). RESULTS: CIN developed more frequently after PCI in patients with T2DM than in patients of the same age without diabetes at the same baseline renal function, volume of contrast media and hydration status. The risk of developing CIN in patients with T2DM is associated with: heart failure, anemia, volume of contrast media, diuretics use in the peri-procedure period, multiple coronary artery disease, need of interventional procedures. TIDM patients with CIN had faster decline of renal function, more often developed cardiovascular diseases and had lower 24 month survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: High risk of CIN development and its prognostic significance in patients with T2DM determine the necessity of individually evaluated risks for preventive measures during contrast media interventions.
