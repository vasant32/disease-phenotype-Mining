AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Although genetic susceptibility plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, most of the genes that influence susceptibility to type 2 diabetes have yet to be identified. Krüppel-like transcription factors are known to play important roles in development and cell differentiation, and have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The present study aimed to examine the associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding members of the Krüppel-like-factor (KLF) family with type 2 diabetes in a large cohort of Japanese subjects. METHODS: We genotyped 33 SNP loci found in 12 KLF genes in subjects with type 2 diabetes and in subjects from the general population using the PCR-Invader assay. We also examined the effects of the overexpression of KLF7 on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. RESULTS: We identified a significant association between an SNP in KLF7 and type 2 diabetes (A vs C: p=0.004 after Bonferroni's correction, odds ratio=1.59, 95% CI 1.27-2.00). The expression of Klf7 decreased in response to the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and the overexpression of KLF7 resulted in significant inhibition of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that the gene encoding KLF7 is a novel candidate for conferring genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.
