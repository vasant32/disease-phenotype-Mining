 OBJECTIVE: To assess rates of depressive symptoms, depression treatment, and satisfaction in a multicultural sample of individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted with a cross-sectional community-based survey design. RESULTS: The sample (n = 221) was predominantly female (60.3%), had type 2 diabetes (75%), and was middle class with a mean (+/-SD) age of 54 +/- 12 years. A total of 53% were white. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) (mean 16.4 +/- 11.3). Using conservative thresholds (CESD score > or =22), 25.3% of participants reported clinically significant depression. Rates of depression did not differ by ethnic group or diabetes type. The majority (76%) of depressed participants reported treatment (52% antidepressants, 63% mental health providers, 19% alternative healers, and 15% herbal remedies). African Americans were less likely to report any depression treatment, to receive antidepressant medications, or receive treatment from a mental health professional compared with whites. Participants with high depressive symptoms reported general satisfaction with depression treatment experiences. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of depressive symptoms were observed across ethnic groups, yet significant differences in use of depression treatment existed across ethnic groups. Those seeking depression treatment reported satisfaction with a variety of depression treatment modalities. Increased depression screening and treatment may be beneficial for ethnically diverse patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
