OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we evaluated whether the coefficient of variation (CV) of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) over a 3-year period was a significant predictor of mortality in type 2 diabetic patients aged 56-74 years. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: All type 2 diabetic patients (n = 1,409) aged 56-74 years attending the Verona Diabetes Clinic and having at least two FPG determinations in each of the years 1984-1986 were followed for 10 years (1987-1996) to assess total and cause-specific mortality Patients were grouped into tertiles of mean and CV of FPG during 1984-1986. These parameters as well as sex, age, diabetes duration, insulin treatment, smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia were included in multivariate survival analyses. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 468 patients died. The CV of FPG was an independent predictor of total, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. Mean FPG was a predictor of total mortality only when the CV of FPG was not included in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term variability of fasting glucose is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. The CV of FPG might be considered a useful additional parameter in the management of these patients.
