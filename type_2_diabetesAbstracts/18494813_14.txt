 AIM: To determine if therapeutic management programmes for type 2 diabetes that include self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) result in greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) compared with programmes without SMBG in non-insulin requiring patients. METHODS: Multicentre, randomized, parallel-group trial. A total of 610 patients were randomized to SMBG or non-SMBG groups. Patients in both groups received the same oral antidiabetic therapy using a gliclazide modified release (MR)-based regimen for 27 weeks. The primary efficacy end-point was the difference between groups in HbA1c at the end of observation. RESULTS: A total of 610 patients were randomized: 311 to the SMBG group and 299 to the non-SMBG group. HbA1c decreased from 8.12 to 6.95% in the SMBG group and from 8.12 to 7.20% in the non-SMBG group; between-group difference was 0.25% (95% CI: 0.06, 1.03; p = 0.0097). Symptoms suggestive of mild to moderate hypoglycaemia was the most commonly reported adverse event, reported by 27 (8.7%) and 21 (7.0%) patients in the SMBG and non-SMBG groups, respectively; the incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was lower in the SMBG group. CONCLUSION: In patients with type 2 diabetes, the application of SMBG as an adjunct to oral antidiabetic agent therapy results in further reductions in HbA1c.
