The term incretin effect was used to describe the fact that oral glucose load produces a greater insulin response than that of an isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion. This difference has been attributed to gastrointestinal peptides GLP-1 and GIP. Since incretin effect is reduced in subjects with type 2 diabetes, despite GLP-1 activity preservation, two forms of incretin-based treatment have emerged: GLP-1R agonists, administered subcutaneously and DPP-4 inhibitors, administered orally. There is a great interest whether incretin-based treatment will be associated with sustained long-term control and improvement in Î²-cell function. The observation that GLP-1R agonists improve myocardial function and survival of cardiomyocytes highlights the need for further studies. Incretin-based therapies offer a new option and show great promise for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
