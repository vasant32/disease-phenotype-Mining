The Nepi ANtidiabetes StudY (NANSY) is a 5-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Swedish primary care, examining whether the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and retinopathy (separately reported) would be delayed in 40- to 70-year-old subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) who, in addition to lifestyle changes, were treated with either placebo or low-dosage sulphonylurea (SU) (1-mg glimepiride; Amaryl). Of 274 subjects (163 men, 111 women), 138 were allocated to placebo (46.0% men, 56.8% women) and 136 to glimepiride (54.0% men, 43.2% women). The primary endpoint was conversion to diabetes. Average follow-up time was 3.71 years; 96 subjects converted to diabetes, 55 allocated to placebo and 41 to glimepiride (absolute difference 9.8%; p = 0.072). In conclusion, the study failed to support the notion that low-dose SU added to lifestyle changes in IFG subjects would help to delay the conversion to diabetes.
