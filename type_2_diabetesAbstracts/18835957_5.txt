 OBJECTIVE: To examine the acute effects of consumption of monounsaturated (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SAFAs) on endothelial function in subjects with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 33 participants were examined after consumption of two different isocaloric meals: one rich in MUFA and one rich in SAFA, in the form of extra-virgin olive oil and butter, respectively. Endothelial function was assessed by determination of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). RESULTS: FMD did not change significantly after the MUFA-rich meal but declined after the SAFA-rich meal. The FMD during the experiment, expressed as incremental area under the curve, increased after the MUFA-rich meal by 5.2 +/- 2.5% and decreased after the SAFA-rich meal by 16.7 +/- 6.0% (Delta = -11.5 +/- 6.4%; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of an SAFA-rich meal is harmful for the endothelium, while a MUFA-rich meal does not impair endothelial function in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
