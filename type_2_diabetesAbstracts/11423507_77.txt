 OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of rosiglitazone (RSG) when added to insulin in the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled on insulin monotherapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After 8 weeks of insulin standardization and placebo (PBO) run-in, 319 type 2 diabetic patients with mean baseline HbA(1c) > or = 7.5% (8.9 +/- 1.1 to 9.1 +/- 1.3) on twice-daily insulin therapy (total daily dose > or = 30 U) were randomized to 26 weeks of additional treatment with RSG (4 or 8 mg daily) or PBO. Insulin dose could be down- titrated only for safety reasons. The primary end point was reduction of HbA(1c) from baseline. RESULTS: RSG 4 and 8 mg daily significantly improved glycemic control, which was unchanged on PBO. By intent-to-treat analysis, treatment with RSG 8 mg plus insulin resulted in a mean reduction from baseline in HbA(1c) of 1.2% (P < 0.0001), despite a 12% mean reduction of insulin dosage. Over 50% of subjects treated daily with RSG 8 mg plus insulin had a reduction of HbA(1c) > or = 1.0%. Neither total:HDL cholesterol nor LDL:HDL cholesterol ratios significantly changed with RSG treatment. Serious adverse events did not differ among groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of RSG to insulin treatment results in significant improvement in glycemic control and is generally well tolerated.
