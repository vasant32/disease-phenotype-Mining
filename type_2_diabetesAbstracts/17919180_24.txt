Over recent years, metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes have finally become recognized as a major challenge to global health. The attention of scientists therefore has to focus on improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind these diseases and towards the design of new drug therapy strategies. The pathophysiology of diabetes is undoubtedly complex, oftentimes characterized by varying states of insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function; however, the identification of new pathways is constantly improving our understanding of the disease. We and others have recently shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can play a role in insulin secretion and glucose homostasis. Thus, in this review, we will discuss the potential role of miRNAs in type 2 diabetes and related metabolic diseases.
