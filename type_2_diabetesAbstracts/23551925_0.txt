The aim was to investigate effects of liraglutide on appetite and energy intake in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study. Eighteen subjects with type 2 diabetes were assigned to treatment with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide (increasing by weekly 0.6 mg increments) or placebo for 3 weeks. Appetite ratings were assessed using visual analogue scales during a 5-h meal test. Energy and macronutrient intake during the subsequent ad libitum lunch were also measured. After 3 weeks, mean postprandial and minimum hunger ratings were significantly lower with liraglutide 1.8â€‰mg than placebo (p<0.01), and the mean overall appetite score was significantly higher (p=0.05), indicating reduced appetite. Liraglutide was associated with higher maximum fullness ratings (p=0.001) and lower minimum ratings of prospective food consumption (p=0.01). Mean estimated energy intake was 18% lower for liraglutide than placebo (estimated ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.73;0.94]; p=0.004), but no significant differences in macronutrient distribution were noted. Findings suggest that reduced appetite and energy intake may contribute to liraglutide-induced weight loss.
