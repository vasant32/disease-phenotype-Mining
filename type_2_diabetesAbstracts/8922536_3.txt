To search for a possible relationship between islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP)/amylin and the pathophysiology of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we examined the changes in IAPP contents in the pancreata of genetically obese and diabetic mice (C57BL/6J ob/ob and C57BL/KsJ db/db mice). In the male ob/ob mice, IAPP and insulin contents began to increase at 16 weeks and continued to increase. In the male db/db mice, IAPP content began to increase at 8 weeks of age and insulin content at 4 weeks. Both contents continued to increase until 16 weeks, but drastically decreased at 24 weeks. Immunohistochemical studies using anti-IAPP8-17 antibody showed the increase of islet cell mass and the heterogeneous immunoreactivity for IAPP in islet cells in the ob/ob mice at 24 weeks of age. In the db/db mice at the same age, the immunoreactivity was heterogeneous and weak in many islet cells. These results suggest that genetic factors that are important in the manifestation of NIDDM influence the capacity of beta-cells to synthesize and secrete IAPP, and that IAPP synthesis and secretion change in the course of the disease.
