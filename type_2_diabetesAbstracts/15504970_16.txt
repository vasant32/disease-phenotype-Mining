Postheparin plasma hepatic lipase (HL) activity has been shown to correlate with features of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in humans. We examined HL postheparin plasma enzyme activity, hepatocyte mRNA, and protein mass in the insulin-resistant, fructose-fed Syrian golden hamster, and the response of the insulin-sensitizing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist rosiglitazone. Male Syrian golden hamsters were treated for 5 weeks with 1) normal diet (DIET group), 2) 60% fructose diet (FRUC group), or 3) 60% fructose and rosiglitazone (20 mmol . kg(-1) . day(-1)) (FRUC+RSG group). Hepatocyte HL mRNA, protein mass, and postheparin plasma HL activity were increased in FRUC compared with DIET hamsters. FRUC+RSG hamsters had partial normalization of HL mRNA, mass, and activity. There was a shift in the size of LDL particles from large to small in FRUC animals and a shift back to large LDL size in FRUC+RSG. This is the first demonstration that HL hepatocyte mRNA, mass, and plasma enzymatic activity increase concomitantly with induction of an insulin-resistant state and can be partially normalized by treatment with an insulin sensitizer. The increase in HL in insulin-resistant states may play an important role in the typical dyslipidemia of these conditions, and reduction of HL could explain some of the beneficial effects of insulin sensitizers on the plasma lipid profile.
