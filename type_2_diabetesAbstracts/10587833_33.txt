OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to examine the association between the metabolic syndrome and socioeconomic position (as indicated by education) among women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study sample comprised healthy women (aged 30-65 years) in Sweden who were representative of the general population in a metropolitan area. Socioeconomic position was measured by educational level (mandatory [< or = 9 years], high school, or college/university). The metabolic syndrome was defined as the presence of two or more of the following components: 1) fasting plasma glucose level > or = 7.0 mmol/l; 2) arterial blood pressure > or = 160/90 mmHg; 3) fasting plasma triglycerides > or = 1.7 mmol/l and/or HDL cholesterol < 1.0 mmol/l; and 4) central obesity (waist-to-hip ratio > 0.85 and/or BMI > 30 kg/m2). RESULTS: After adjustment for age, the risk ratio for the presence of the metabolic syndrome comparing the lowest (< or = 9 years) with the highest (college/university) education was 2.7 (95% CI 1.1-6.8). This association persisted after controlling for menopausal status, family history of diabetes, and behavioral risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Low education is associated with increased risk for metabolic syndrome in middle-aged women. These findings show that not only are women with low socioeconomic position at increased risk for individual risk factors that are associated with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, they are also at increased risk for the metabolic clustering of risk factors.
