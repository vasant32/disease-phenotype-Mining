Thyroid dysfunction was assessed in an older population-based cohort with type 2 diabetes. Among type 2 diabetes subjects, 7.1% had incident thyroid dysfunction versus 3.8% in those without diabetes (odds ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 0.88-4.38). Screening of thyroid dysfunction in older diabetes subjects is not supported by these findings.
