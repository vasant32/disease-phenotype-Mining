Polymorphisms of the genes involved in the metabolism of vitamin D may predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). For example, there is evidence suggesting that vitamin D binding protein (DBP) amino acid variants at codons 416 (aspartic acid-->glutamic acid) and 420 (threonine-->lysine) may affect genetic susceptibility to T2DM. The aims of this study are: (1) to determine the allele, genotype, haplotype and haplotype combination frequencies of those DBP amino acid variants in a Polish population and (2) to examine their role in the genetic susceptibility to T2DM in a Polish population. Overall 393 individuals were included in this study: 231 T2DM patients and 162 controls. The sequence of DBP exon 11, which contains both examined variants, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Alleles and genotypes were determined based on electrophoresis of the DNA digestion products by specific restriction enzymes HaeIII and StyI. Since variants of DBP were in very strong linkage disequilibrium, haplotypes could be assigned to phase-unknown individuals. Differences in distributions between the groups were examined by chi(2) test. At codon 416 the frequency of Asp/Glu alleles was 44.6/55.4% in T2DM patients and 40.7/59.3% in controls (chi(2)=2.1, d.f.=1, P=0.28). At codon 420 the frequency of Thr/Lys alleles were 69.4/30.6% and 71.6/28.4%, (chi(2)=0.41, d.f.=1, P=0.52), respectively. Distribution of genotypes, haplotypes and haplotype combinations were similar in both groups. In conclusion, the frequency of amino acid variants at codons 416 and 420 of vitamin D binding protein gene in a Polish population is similar to other Caucasian populations, but differs significantly from other races. No evidence was found for an association between DBP frequent polymorphisms and T2DM in this population.
