We report the identification of two novel polymorphisms in the PRKAG2 gene and preliminary association study between 5'-UTR and exon 1 polymorphisms with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. No association with type 2 diabetes was identified. However, one of these newly identified polymorphisms (p.Ser20Ile) is likely associated with cardiac disease.
