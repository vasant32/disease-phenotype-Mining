We examined the postprandial glucose regulators nateglinide and GLP-1, separately and in combination, in people with type 2 diabetes. Nateglinide inhibited DPP-4 activity, reduced GLP-1 degradation and enhanced its insulinotropic and blood glucose lowering effect. Combining nateglinide and GLP-1 derivatives may effectively control postprandial glycaemia.
