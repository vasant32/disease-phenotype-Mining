 AIM: To examine the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin vs. glimepiride as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a 52-week interim analysis of a large, randomized, double-blind, multicentre study. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of vildagliptin vs. glimepiride in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) reduction at week 52. METHODS: Patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy (HbA(1c) 6.5-8.5%) and receiving a stable dose of metformin (mean dose 1898 mg/day; mean duration of use 36 months) were randomized 1:1 to receive vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily, n = 1396) or glimepiride (titrated up to 6 mg/day; mean dose 4.5 mg/day, n = 1393). RESULTS: Non-inferiority of vildagliptin was demonstrated (97.5% confidence interval 0.02%, 0.16%) with a mean (SE) change from baseline HbA(1c) (7.3% in both groups) to week 52 endpoint of -0.44% (0.02%) with vildagliptin and -0.53% (0.02%) with glimepiride. Although a similar proportion of patients reached a target HbA(1c) level of <7% with vildagliptin and glimepiride (54.1 and 55.5%, respectively), a greater proportion of patients reached this target without hypoglycaemia in the vildagliptin group (50.9 vs. 44.3%; p < 0.01). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) reductions were comparable between groups (mean [SE] -1.01 [0.06] mmol/l and -1.14 [0.06] mmol/l respectively). Vildagliptin significantly reduced body weight relative to glimepiride (mean [SE] change from baseline -0.23 [0.11] kg; between-group difference -1.79 kg; p < 0.001) and resulted in a 10-fold lower incidence of hypoglycaemia than glimepiride (1.7 vs. 16.2% of patients presenting at least one hypoglycaemic event; 39 vs. 554 hypoglycaemic events, p < 0.01). No severe hypoglycaemia occurred with vildagliptin compared with 10 episodes with glimepiride (p < 0.01), and no patient in the vildagliptin group discontinued because of hypoglycaemia compared with 11 patients in the glimepiride group. The incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and adjudicated cardiovascular events was 74.5, 7.1 and 0.9%, respectively, in patients receiving vildagliptin, and 81.1, 9.5 and 1.6%, respectively, in patients receiving glimepiride. CONCLUSIONS: When metformin alone fails to maintain sufficient glycaemic control, the addition of vildagliptin provides comparable efficacy to that of glimepiride after 52 weeks and displays a favourable AE profile, with no weight gain and a significant reduction in hypoglycaemia compared with glimepiride.
