Stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle and liver is seen as an exciting prospect for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, we have recently demonstrated that changes in AMPK activity accompany the exposure of pancreatic islet beta-cells to elevated glucose concentrations and may be involved in the activation of insulin secretion. Here, we discuss this hypothesis and explore the potential role of changes in AMPK activity in the actions of other secretagogues. Amino acids decreased AMPK activity in MIN6 beta-cells with an order of potency for inhibition: arg=leu < gln= leu + glu < glucose, which was closely correlated with the stimulation of insulin release (r2=0.76). By contrast, increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration provoked by cell depolarization with KCl activated AMPK in the face of increased free intracellular ATP concentrations. Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels with isobutylmethylxanthine or forskolin had no effect on AMPK activity. We conclude that metabolizable amino acids regulate AMPK in the beta-cell via increases in the cytosolic ATP/AMP ratio and via phosphorylation by the upstream kinase LKB1. Intracellular Ca2+ ions may activate AMPK by calmodulin kinase 1 kinase-mediated phosphorylation. The latter may act as a novel feedback mechanism to inhibit excessive insulin secretion under some circumstances.
