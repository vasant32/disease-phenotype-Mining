 OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether alterations of glycolytic and oxidative enzyme capacity in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 diabetes pertain to specific muscle fibers and are associated with changes in muscle fiber composition. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Vastus lateralis muscle was obtained by percutaneous biopsy from 10 patients with type 2 diabetes and 15 age- and BMI-matched healthy volunteers. Using cytophotometry, muscle fiber composition and fiber type-specific glycolytic and oxidative enzyme activities were measured in slow oxidative, fast oxidative glycolytic, and fast glycolytic fibers. RESULTS: In the whole muscle, oxidative activity was decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes. The slow oxidative fiber fraction was reduced by 16%, whereas the fast glycolytic fiber fraction was increased by 49% in skeletal muscle from the diabetic patients. Both oxidative and glycolytic enzyme activities were significantly increased in fast glycolytic and fast oxidative glycolytic fibers of type 2 diabetic patients. However, the fiber-specific ratio of glycolytic enzyme activity relative to oxidative activity was not different between type 2 diabetic patients and the control subjects. The myofibrillic ATP activity was significantly lower in all fiber types of patients with type 2 diabetes and correlates with glucose infusion rate during the steady state of a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and maximal aerobic capacity and negatively with HbA(1c) values. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced oxidative enzyme activity in muscle of type 2 diabetic patients is most likely due to a reduction in slow oxidative fibers. Increased glycolytic and oxidative enzyme activities in individual muscle fibers are closely related to measures of long-term glycemic control and whole-body insulin sensitivity and could therefore represent a compensatory mechanism of the muscle in function of the altered glucose metabolism.
