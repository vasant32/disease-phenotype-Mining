Both elevated liver enzymes and a family history of diabetes mellitus (FHDM) are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. This study evaluates the epidemiological association between elevated liver enzymes and FHDM. Subjects included 3512 women workers without diabetes, hepatitis, a smoking habit, or a history of alcohol intake. Blood samples and personal data were collected from all subjects. Subjects with FHDM had a higher mean body mass index (BMI: 23.9kg/m(2) vs. 23.4kg/m(2); p=0.003). Laboratory testing also revealed higher mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG: 5.67mmol/L vs. 5.22mmol/L; p<0.001), asparate aminotransferase (AST: 20.0IU/L vs. 19.2IU/L; p=0.049), alanine aminotransferase (ALT: 18.4IU/L vs. 16.7IU/L; p=0.004), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT: 24.1IU/L vs. 20.5IU/L; p<0.001), and triglycerides (TG: 1.09mmol/L vs. 1.00mmol/L; p=0.011) for FHDM subjects, when adjusted for age and BMI. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that FHDM, age, BMI, FPG, and TG were correlated with GGT (p=0.004 for FHDM; p<0.001 for age, BMI, FPG, and TG). Elevated liver enzymes were associated with FHDM. In particular, elevated GGT was related to FHDM, independent of the other variables. Elevated liver enzymes, probably due to fat deposition in the liver, may play a role in increasing the risk of diabetes in individuals with FHDM.
