 OBJECTIVE: We screened the human aldose reductase (ALR) gene for DNA sequence variants in type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects and investigated whether the previously reported and novel polymorphisms were associated with neurophysiologic deterioration and clinical peripheral neuropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population included 85 Finnish type 2 diabetic and 126 nondiabetic subjects. The genetic analyses were performed using the PCR, single-strand conformation polymorphism, restriction fragment-length polymorphism, and automated laser fluorescence scanning analyses. A detailed neurologic examination and neurophysiologic analyses were performed at the time of diagnosis and at the 10-year examination. RESULTS: The genetic screening identified four polymorphisms: C-106T, C-11G, A11370G, and C19739A. The C and Z-2 alleles of the C-106T polymorphism and the previously reported (CA)(n) repeat marker were more frequent in type 2 diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects. At baseline, the diabetic subjects with the T allele of the C-106T polymorphism had lower sensory response amplitude values in the peroneal (P = 0.025), sural (P = 0.007), and radial (P = 0.057) nerves and, during follow-up, a greater decrease in the conduction velocity of the motor peroneal nerve than those with the C-106C genotype. No associations were found between the polymorphisms examined and clinical polyneuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: The C-106T polymorphism of the ALR gene may contribute to an early development of neurophysiologic deterioration in type 2 diabetic patients.
