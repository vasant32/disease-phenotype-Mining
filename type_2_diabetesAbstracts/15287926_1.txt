AIM: The aim of the present study was to analyze serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels in Pakistani patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and to find correlations between clinical characteristics and dyslipidaemias in these patients. METHODS: Fasting blood samples were analyzed for Lp(a), total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in 68 Pakistani patients with type 2 DM and 40 non-diabetic healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Lp(a) levels were significantly raised in diabetics as compared to the control group. No correlation of Lp(a) was seen with age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and fasting glucose. There was a positive correlation of BMI to SBP and DBP. There was a significant positive correlation between Lp(a) and total cholesterol and LDL-c. No correlation of Lp(a) was observed with HDL-c, triglycerides and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). CONCLUSION: The present study led us to conclude that serum Lp(a) levels are significantly raised in type 2 DM and have a positive correlation with serum total and LDL-c levels.
