The 497 members of the London Cohort of the WHO Multinational Study of Vascular Disease in Diabetics have been followed for mortality from 1975 to 1987. During this period 92 patients died. The most common cause of death was myocardial infarction: 36 (39.1%) deaths, heart disease was responsible for 51.1% of deaths and all cardiovascular disease for 55.4%. Neoplastic disease accounted for 25% of the deaths and diabetic nephropathy for 5.4%. Age-standardised mortality rates were higher in men than in women in both Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes. Standardised mortality ratios for the first and second five year follow-up periods were higher for men than for women in Type 2 diabetes but were higher for women than men in Type 1. The results suggest that the female survival advantage seen in the general population may persist in Type 2 but not in Type 1 diabetes.
