 OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine if serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are lower in men with type 2 diabetes compared with those in healthy men and to investigate what factors may be associated with serum PSA levels in men with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the serum PSA levels in 224 diabetic men with those in 1,293 healthy men and investigated the relationships between serum PSA levels and various variables. RESULTS: Except for men aged 40-49 years, serum PSA levels were lower in diabetic men than in healthy men. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that age, BMI, and presence of diabetes were independent determinants of serum PSA level. CONCLUSIONS: Serum PSA levels were lower in diabetic men compared with those in healthy men, which is in line with previous reports that patients with type 2 diabetes are at a decreased risk of prostate cancer.
