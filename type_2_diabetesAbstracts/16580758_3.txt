 AIM: Type 2 diabetes is not only associated with hyperglycemia but also with disorders of lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of dyslipedemia with micro and macro vascular complications of diabetes. METHODS: Population based cross sectional study included 4067 diabetic patients who visited hospital during January 2000 to December 2002. Lipid profile was estimated by semi autoanalyser, Retinopathy was assessed by fundoscopy, Nephropathy by microalbuminurea, coronary artery disease (CAD) by electro cardiogram (ECG) changes, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) by doppler study and neuropathy by clinical examinations. The association of dyslipedemia with micro and macro vascular complications was assessed by regression analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of dyslipedemia is high in diabetic population with high serum cholesterol >240mg/dl was seen in 15%, serum triglycerides >160mg/dl was seen in 42.41%, raised LDL >130mg/dl in 45.26%, VLDL >40mg/dl in 24.09% and low levels of HDL-C <40mg/dl were seen in 52.27%. On regression analysis, CAD had strong correlation with high levels of VLDL (0.76), triglycerides (0.82), LDL (0.23) and low HDL (-0.81). Similar association was seen with PVD. Diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy were found to have significant correlation with low HDL (-0.43) and raised LDL (0.37), respectively. Neuropathy was not found to have any significant correlation with lipid profile abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Lipid profile abnormalities are very common in type 2 diabetes and it has great influence on CAD and PVD. Hence, appropriate preventive and treatment strategies should be considered timely.
