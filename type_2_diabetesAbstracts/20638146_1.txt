 OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical appearance of Candida-associated denture stomatitis (DS) in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The relationships between the types of DS, oral complaints and associated conditions were assessed in terms of glycemic control as determined by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical data were obtained from questionnaires and oral examinations of 110 edentulous patients with T2DM and 50 control subjects. RESULTS: Type II DS commonly occurred in diabetics (57.3% vs 30%; p=0.002) together with DS related oral complaints (60.9% vs 24%; p<0.001) compared with controls. Burning sensation of the mouth (BS) was the most common complaint. Dryness of the oral mucosa (DOM) (50.9% vs 6%; p<0.001), angular cheilitis (26.4% vs 8%; p=0.01) and glossitis (27.3% vs 6%; p=0.003) occurred more frequently in diabetics. Oral complaints and associated conditions of DS coincided with elevated HbA1c levels (p<0.001). Diabetics with extensive type of inflammation had higher HbA1c levels than type I/III DS subjects (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse type of inflammation was associated with T2DM. BS and DOM were the most common oral complaints. Inadequately controlled diabetes with Candida-associated DS was linked to a high incidence of an extensive type of inflammation, oral complaints and associated conditions.
