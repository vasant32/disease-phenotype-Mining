 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We have previously demonstrated the therapeutic usefulness of leptin in lipoatrophic diabetes and insulin-deficient diabetes in mouse models and could also demonstrate its dramatic effects on lipoatrophic diabetes in humans. The aim of the present study was to explore the therapeutic usefulness of leptin in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes with increased adiposity. METHODS: To generate a mouse model mimicking human type 2 diabetes with increased adiposity, we used a combination of low-dose streptozotocin (STZ, 120 microg/g body weight) and high-fat diet (HFD, 45% of energy as fat). Recombinant mouse leptin was infused chronically (20 ng [g body weight](-1) h(-1)) for 14 days using a mini-osmotic pump. The effects of leptin on food intake, body weight, metabolic variables, tissue triacylglycerol content and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity were examined. RESULTS: Low-dose STZ injection led to a substantial reduction of plasma insulin levels and hyperglycaemia. Subsequent HFD feeding increased adiposity and induced insulin resistance and further augmentation of hyperglycaemia. In this model mouse mimicking human type 2 diabetes (STZ/HFD), continuous leptin infusion reduced food intake and body weight and improved glucose and lipid metabolism with enhancement of insulin sensitivity. Leptin also decreased liver and skeletal muscle triacylglycerol content accompanied by an increase of alpha2 AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. Pair-feeding experiments demonstrated that leptin improved glucose and lipid metabolism independently of the food intake reduction. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates the beneficial effects of leptin on glycaemic and lipid control in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes with increased adiposity, indicating the possible clinical usefulness of leptin as a new glucose-lowering drug in humans.
