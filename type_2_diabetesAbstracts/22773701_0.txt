 OBJECTIVE: Recent human studies suggested that serum osteocalcin is associated with the cross-talk between bone and energy metabolism. The aim of this study was to determine whether serum osteocalcin level is independently associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed of 1,229 nondiabetic men, aged 25-60 years, who were recruited from the Health Promotion Center, Samsung Medical Center, between January 1997 and December 1997. They were followed regularly at the center on an out-patient basis and during hospitalization for a mean of 8.4 years, and the development of type 2 diabetes was determined. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, BMI, body fat percentage, triglyceride, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance value, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels varied inversely with the osteocalcin tertiles, and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased with the osteocalcin tertiles. However, no differences were observed in fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels across the osteocalcin tertiles. Incident type 2 diabetes occurred in 90 (7.3%) of the study subjects. In Cox proportional hazards models, however, no statistical differences in the development of type 2 diabetes across the osteocalcin tertiles were evident after adjustment of other risk factors for incident diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Despite baseline associations with favorable metabolic parameters, the serum osteocalcin level was not associated with the development of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged males.
