 OBJECTIVE: Reduction in LDL and high sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) are independent indicators of successful cardiovascular risk reduction with statins. This study compared the effect of equivalent LDL-lowering doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin on hsCRP in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A crossover study of 26 patients with type 2 diabetes taking either 40 mg simvastatin or 10 mg atorvastatin was undertaken. After 3 months on one statin, lipids and hsCRP were measured on 10 occasions over a 5-week period. The same procedure was then followed taking the other statin. RESULTS: LDL was comparable on either treatment: atorvastatin 2.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (mean +/- SD; P = 0.19). CRP of individuals taking atorvastatin was significantly lower than when they were taking simvastatin (median 1.08 vs. 1.47 mg/l, P = 0.0002) and was less variable (median SD of logCRP 0.0036 vs. 0.178, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin reduced hsCRP and its variability in type 2 diabetic patients. This enhanced anti-inflammatory effect may prove beneficial if lower CRP is associated with improved cardiovascular risk.
