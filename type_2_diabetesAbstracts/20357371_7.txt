 OBJECTIVE: To determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic dose-response effects of insulin glargine administered subcutaneously in individuals with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty obese type 2 diabetic individuals (10 male and 10 female, aged 50 +/- 3 years, with BMI 36 +/- 2 kg/m(2) and A1C 8.3 +/- 0.6%) were studied in this single-center, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study. Five subcutaneous doses of insulin glargine (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 units/kg) were investigated on separate occasions using the 24-h euglycemic clamp technique. RESULTS Glargine duration of action to reduce glucose, nonessential fatty acid (NEFA), and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels was close to or >24 h for all four doses. Increases in glucose flux revealed no discernible peak and were modest with maximal glucose infusion rates of 9.4, 6.6, 5.5, and 2.8 mumol/kg/min for the 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, and 0.5 units/kg doses, respectively. Glargine exhibited a relatively hepatospecific action with greater suppression (P < 0.05) of endogenous glucose production (EGP) compared with little or no increases in glucose disposal. CONCLUSION: A single subcutaneous injection of glargine at a dose of >or=0.5 units/kg can acutely reduce glucose, NEFA, and ketone body levels for 24 h in obese insulin-resistant type 2 diabetic individuals. Glargine lowers blood glucose by mainly inhibiting EGP with limited effects on stimulating glucose disposal. Large doses of glargine have minimal effects on glucose flux and retain a relatively hepatospecific action in type 2 diabetes.
