The objective of this study was to determine the effects of ingesting a snack bar containing uncooked cornstarch (Extend Bar, Clinical Products, Limited, Key Biscayne, FL) on nocturnal glycemic excursion in 28 adults (ages 22-78 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean HbAlc 8.21+/-1.28%). Thirteen subjects were treated with oral agents, eight with a combination of insulin and oral agents, and seven with insulin alone. Subjects ingested the study bar (Extend Bar, containing 30 g of total carbohydrate, including 5 g of uncooked cornstarch, 3 g protein, and 3 g fat) for three evenings followed by a placebo bar for 3 evenings (30 g of total carbohydrate, 3 g protein, and 3 g fat), or vice versa. Pre-snack before bedtime, midnight and before breakfast finger stick blood glucose levels were compared to determine the incidence of hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dl), hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dl), and to calculate any differences in the group's mean blood glucose levels when ingesting the study versus the placebo bar. There were no episodes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. The mean blood glucose levels pre-snack at bedtime were nearly identical (Extend Bar value 117.5+/-45.6 mg/dl; placebo bar value 117.3+/-40.0 mg/dl; P=0.977), and lower at midnight and before breakfast on the Extend Bar nights compared to the placebo bar nights (Extend Bar, midnight value 127.9+/-31.0 mg/dl; placebo bar midnight value 148.2+/-32.1 mg/dl; P=0.0001; Extend Bar breakfast value 114.2+/-15.8 mg/dl; placebo bar breakfast value 158.49+/-30.3 mg/dl; P<0.0001). These data suggest that ingesting Extend Bar containing uncooked cornstarch as the nighttime snack may be an effective strategy to lesson the frequency of nocturnal and morning hyperglycemia in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
