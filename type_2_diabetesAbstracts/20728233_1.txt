 INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus incidence has an increasing rate and it's genetic aspect is an important approach as a risk factor and predictive value in this disorder. In some population, SUMO4, a regulator of NF-ÎºB, gene polymorphism is associated with diabetes. A single-nucleotide polymorphism was detected in SUMO4; substituting a highly conserved methionine with a valine residue (M55V). We studied the association between M55V polymorphism in the SUMO4 gene insusceptibility of type 2 diabetes in patients with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were 50 patients with type 2 diabetes and 50 control Iranian subjects. Genotyping was done using polymorphism chain reaction (PCR) technique and subsequent cleavage by restriction endonuclease (RFLP) for the M55V SUMO4 gene variant. RESULTS: The frequency of SUMO4 AA, AG and GG were 13%, 25% and 12% in control group and 20%, 22%, 18% in the type 2 diabetes patients respectively. The SUMO4 M55V variant was not associated with the susceptibility of type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that the SUMO4 gene M55V variant was not associated with the susceptibility of the type 2 diabetes polymorphism.
