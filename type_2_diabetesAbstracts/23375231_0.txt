 AIMS: Chronic low-grade inflammation and/or obesity are suggested to induce chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes. This cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and CKD in non-obese patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 106 non-obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited for the measurement of GFR, TNF, HMW adiponectin, leptin, hsCRP and some variables including urinary albumin. BMI, serum creatinine, and urinary albumin levels were 22.2±0.2kg/m(2) (17.1-24.9kg/m(2)), 0.76±0.02mg/dl (0.39-1.38mg/dl), 40.4±4.3mg/gCr (1.6-195.0mg/gCr), respectively. They were stratified into two groups based on the value of eGFR: low eGFR (eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m(2)) and normal eGFR (eGFR>60ml/min/1.73m(2)). Logistic regression analysis was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Whereas univariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, diabetes duration, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, urinary albumin, and soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-R1, sTNF-R2) are associated with the development of stage 3 CKD, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that sTNF-R2 (Odds ratio 1.003, 95% confidence interval 1.000 to 1.005, P=0.030) showed significant associations with the development of stage 3 CKD. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating TNF receptor 2 is an independent risk factor for CKD in non-obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
