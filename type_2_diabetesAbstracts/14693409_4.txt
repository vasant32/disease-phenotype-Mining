Insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones (TZDs) decrease inflammatory markers such as high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in sera in addition to their hypoglycemic effects. However, factors associated with the decrease in serum hsCRP concentrations are unclear. In the present study, an effect of troglitazone on serum hsCRP levels was investigated and compared with its effect on glycemia. A total of 34 subjects with type 2 diabetes (17 men and 17 women, aged 54+/-2 years and body mass index (BMI) 26.7+/-0.6 kg/m(2), mean+/-S.E.) were studied. Nineteen out of the 34 subjects was treated with troglitazone 400mg daily for 12 weeks. The remaining 15 subjects were treated with metformin 750 mg daily as a control group. Baseline hsCRP levels were comparable between the two groups, and those were positively associated with fasting insulin levels. After treatment, glycemic control assessed by HbA1c and fasting glucose levels improved in both groups, whereas insulin sensitivity index estimated by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-R) decreased only in the troglitazone-treated group. Serum levels of hsCRP significantly decreased from 916+/-210 ng/ml to 569+/-123 ng/ml (P<0.05) in the troglitazone-treated group, whereas the levels remained unchanged in the metformin-treated group (from 1087+/-248 ng/ml to 1152+/-301 ng/ml). In the troglitazone-treated group, there was no difference in the absolute and percent change in serum hsCRP levels between responders, who displayed the decrease in HbA1c greater than 0.6% (n=12), and the remaining non-responders (n=7). The decrease in serum hsCRP concentrations was negatively related to baseline levels of serum hsCRP and insulin and HOMA-R. In conclusion, troglitazone, but not metformin, reduced serum hsCRP levels in type 2 diabetic patients. The decrease in serum hsCRP concentrations by troglitazone was associated with the pretreatment levels of hsCRP and insulin resistance, but independent of the changes in glycemia.
