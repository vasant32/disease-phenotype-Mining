Microalbuminuria and aortic stiffness are associated with high mortality in type 2 diabetic patients. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of microalbuminuria correlates with aortic stiffness and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients. The study consisted of 36 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (age: 56+/-9 years, mean+/-S.D.) and a control group of 44 age-matched patients with normoalbuminuria (56+/-7 years). Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (BaPWV) was measured by automatic oscillometric method. BaPWV was used as an index of atherosclerosis. The BaPWV was higher in the microalbuminuria group than in the normoalbuminuria group (p<0.005). Fasting plasma glucose (p<0.05) and insulin concentrations (p<0.005), and the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index (p<0.0005), were higher in the microalbuminuria group than in the normoalbuminuria group. Multiple regression analysis showed that urinary albumin excretion was independently predicted by BaPWV and HOMA index. Our results indicate that the presence of microalbuminuria in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes is characterized by increased aortic stiffness and insulin resistance, and that the BaPWV, HOMA index are independent predictors of urine albumin excretion.
