 OBJECTIVE: Compared with men and women without diabetes, individuals with type 2 diabetes have higher bone mineral density (BMD). However, they may still be at increased risk for hip fractures. Using population-based Ontario health care data, we compared the risk of hip fractures among men and women with and without diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a retrospective cohort design, we identified Ontario residents aged > or =66 years with diabetes from a validated registry from 1994 to 1995 (n = 197,412) and followed them for their first hip fracture until 31 March 2003 (mean 6.1-year follow-up). Hip fracture rates were compared with those of age-matched Ontario residents without diabetes (n = 401,400), and results were stratified by sex and adjusted for age and other covariates. RESULTS: Compared with individuals without diabetes, individuals with diabetes had greater comorbidity, were less likely to have had a BMD test, and were more likely to be taking medications that increase risk of falling and decrease BMD. After adjusting for these differences and age, we found that diabetes increased fracture risk in both men (hazard ratio 1.18 [95% CI 1.12-1.24], P < 0.0001) and women (1.11 [1.08-1.15], P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Men and women with diabetes have a higher risk of hip fractures compared with individuals without diabetes. Further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this increased risk of fracture is needed, as well as increased attention to fracture prevention strategies in patients with diabetes.
