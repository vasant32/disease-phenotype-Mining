AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Obesity and fatty liver are commonly associated with type 2 diabetes, but the genetic and functional bases linking fatty liver with obesity and diabetes are largely unknown. Our aim was to investigate the association of fatty liver with obesity and other diabetes-related phenotypes and to define the genetic control of obesity and fatty liver. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established 306 F2 mice by crossing Nagoya-Shibata-Yasuda (NSY) mice, an animal model of type 2 diabetes, with control C3H mice, and analysed their phenotypes. Whole-genome screening of F2 mice was performed to identify the loci responsible for fatty liver and obesity. RESULTS: A strong association of fatty liver with obesity, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia was observed in F2 mice. Using whole-genome screening in 306 F2 mice, we mapped a new locus for fatty liver (Fl1n) on chromosome 6 (maximum logarithm of odds score [MLS] 10.0) and one for body weight (Bw1n) on chromosome 7 (MLS 5.1). Fl1n was linked to epididymal fat weight as well as fatty liver, but its effects were opposite in the two tissues in that the NSY allele increased liver fat but decreased epididymal fat, suggesting a role of Fl1n in partitioning of fat mass. The sequence of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg), a candidate for Fl1n, showed allelic variation between NSY and C3H mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that fatty liver and obesity are phenotypically related but genetically independent. Loci homologous to Fl1n and Bw1n are good candidate genes for susceptibility to fatty liver and obesity in humans.
