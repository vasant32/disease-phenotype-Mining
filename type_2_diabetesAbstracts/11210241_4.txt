Only recently are we beginning to understand the complex interplay of factors involved in vascular disease and diabetes. Insulin resistance provides a starting point to explain the many factors that lead to the more severe vascular disease characteristic of diabetes. Insulin resistance syndrome comprises insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia as well as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, macrovascular disease, and increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity. The development of type 2 diabetes may be viewed as the inability of the pancreas to continue to overcome insulin resistance, even with excessive insulin production.
