 OBJECTIVE: Resistin, secreted from adipocytes, causes insulin resistance in rodents. We previously reported that the G/G genotype of a resistin gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -420 increases type 2 diabetes susceptibility by enhancing promoter activity. We report here on the relation between plasma resistin and either SNP -420 genotype or factors related to insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We cross-sectionally analyzed 2,078 community-dwelling Japanese subjects attending a yearly medical checkup. The SNP -420 genotype was determined by TaqMan analysis. Fasting plasma resistin was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. RESULTS: Plasma resistin was associated with the SNP -420 genotype (P < 0.0001), which was highest in G/G followed by C/G and C/C. Plasma resistin was higher in elderly individuals, female subjects, nondrinkers, and subjects with high blood pressure (P < 0.001, 0.003, <0.001, and 0.001, respectively). Simple regression analysis revealed that age, female sex, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, systolic blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were positively correlated with plasma resistin (P < 0.001, 0.003, <0.001, 0.004, <0.001, and 0.003, respectively). Multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and BMI revealed that plasma resistin was an independent factor for HOMA-IR, low HDL cholesterol, and hs-CRP (P = 0.001, <0.001, and 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma resistin was associated with SNP -420 and was correlated with insulin resistance, low serum HDL cholesterol, and high hs-CRP in the Japanese general population.
