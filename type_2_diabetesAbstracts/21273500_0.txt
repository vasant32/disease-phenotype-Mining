 OBJECTIVE: To examine patterns of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption among U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes in 2003-2006. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 24-h dietary recall data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 to estimate SSB consumption levels among 1,090 adults (aged ≥ 20 years) with type 2 diabetes overall and by diagnosis and control status of their diabetes. RESULTS: In 2003-2006, 45% of adults with diabetes consumed SSBs on a given day, obtaining an average of 202 calories and 47 g of sugar. Undiagnosed adults with diabetes were significantly more likely to consume SSBs than diagnosed adults (60 vs. 38% diagnosed/uncontrolled [P < 0.001] and 43% diagnosed/controlled [P = 0.001]) and were less likely to consume diet beverages (18 vs. 50% diagnosed/uncontrolled [P < 0.001] and 40% diagnosed/controlled [P < 0.001]). Men consumed significantly more SSBs than women (P = 0.027), younger adults (aged 20-44) more than older adults (45-64 and ≥ 65; P < 0.001), non-Hispanic black more than whites (P = 0.010); and low-income individuals (quartile 1) more than higher-income individuals (quartile 3, P = 0.040; quartile 4, P = 0.013). For most demographic and body weight categories, adults who were undiagnosed consumed more sugar from SSBs than adults who were diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: SSB consumption is high among adults with diabetes, particularly among those who are undiagnosed.
