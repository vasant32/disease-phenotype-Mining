We tested the relationship between plasma levels of dimethylarginines (ADMA and SDMA) and glycaemic control in 43 type 2 diabetic patients. Type 2 diabetics with poor glycaemic control (HbA1c>6.5) had significantly lower SDMA and higher ADMA concentrations than those with well-controlled glycaemia (HbA1c<6.5).
