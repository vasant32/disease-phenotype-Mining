 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) add value to the Framingham risk score (FRS) in predicting the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in type 2 diabetic patients with a negative history of CVD. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients (n = 783) were retrospectively recruited and followed for CVD. RESULTS: During a 5.4-year follow-up period, 85 incidences of CVD were recorded (10.9%). After adjustment for conventional arterial risk factors, multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model identified IMT, but not baPWV, as a significant determinant of CVD. In addition, the combination of FRS with IMT, but not with baPWV, improved the prediction of CVD. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid IMT is a significant predictor of CVD in asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients, and the combination of FRS and IMT improves the prediction of CVD in these patients.
