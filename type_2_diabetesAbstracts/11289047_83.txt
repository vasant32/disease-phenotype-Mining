In obesity and type 2 diabetes, skeletal muscle has been observed to have a reduced oxidative enzyme activity, increased glycolytic activity, and increased lipid content. These metabolic characteristics are related to insulin resistance of skeletal muscle and are factors potentially related to muscle fiber type. The current study was undertaken to examine the interactions of muscle fiber type in relation to oxidative enzyme activity, glycolytic enzyme activity, and muscle lipid content in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects compared with lean healthy volunteers. The method of single-fiber analysis was used on vastus lateralis muscle obtained by percutaneous biopsy from 22 lean, 20 obese, and 20 type 2 diabetic subjects (ages 35+/-1, 42+/-2, and 52+/-2 years, respectively), with values for BMI that were similar in obese and diabetic subjects (23.7+/-0.7, 33.2+/-0.8, and 31.8+/-0.8 kg/m2, respectively). Oxidative enzyme activity followed the order of type I > type IIa > type IIb, but within each fiber type, skeletal muscle from obese and type 2 diabetic subjects had lower oxidative enzyme activity than muscle from lean subjects (P < 0.01). Muscle lipid content followed a similar pattern in relation to fiber type, and within each fiber type, muscle from obese and type 2 diabetic subjects had greater lipid content (P < 0.01). In summary, based on single-fiber analysis, skeletal muscle in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects mani-fests disturbances of oxidative enzyme activity and increased lipid content that are independent of the effect of fiber type.
