 OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF21) has beneficial effects on lipolysis. Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a predictor of type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study aimed to determine the levels of serum FGF21 and hs-CRP in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients with and without NAFLD, and further explored the correlation between FGF21 with hs-CRP in newly diagnosed type 2 DM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 69 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 DM and 30 normal subjects were included in the study. FGF21 and hs-CRP were measured by ELISA kits. The severity of NAFLD was measured by ultrasound. RESULTS: Serum FGF21 in newly diagnosed type 2 DM with NAFLD group were significantly increased (p<0.01). There was no difference for the FGF21 level in normal control group and newly diagnosed type 2 DM without NFALD group. In type 2 DM group, the FGF21 level was positively correlated with hsCRP (r=0.417, p<0.001). In multiple stepwise regression models, only hsCRP was a significantly independent determinant for serum FGF21. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of FGF21 are closely related to liver steatosis in newly diagnosed type 2 DM patients.
