Two hundred type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients and 170 non-diabetic age- and sex-matched normotensive controls were examined for limited joint mobility (LJM) and Dupuytren's contracture (DC), and their smoking history was documented. The prevalences of LJM and DC were not significantly different in diabetic and control subjects (LJM: odds ratio 1.58, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.50; DC: odds ratio 1.34, CI 0.81 to 2.23). Cigarette smoking was positively associated with both LJM and DC in the diabetic patients (LJM: relative risk (R) = 1.96, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.49; DC: R = 2.88, CI 1.29 to 6.43) and in the control group (LJM: R = 2.22, CI 1.70 to 5.86; DC: R = 2.71, CI 1.23 to 5.89). Limited joint mobility and Dupuytren's contracture are both associated with cigarette smoking in type 2 diabetic patients and in age-matched non-diabetic subjects. This suggests that type 2 diabetes is only one of a number of factors which promote the development of these connective tissue changes.
