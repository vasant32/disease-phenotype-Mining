The spontaneously diabetic Torii (SDT) rat was recently recognized as a new animal model of non-obese type 2 diabetes. As the severe diabetic ocular complications seen in SDT rats already have been investigated, we examined another common diabetic complication, gastroenteropathy. Male SDT rats developed diabetes at 20 weeks and diarrhea at 28 weeks of age. Gastrointestinal motility was evaluated at 28 weeks by measuring the distance of small intestinal transit by oral administration of the non-absorbed marker, arabic gum. SDT rats exhibited greater intestinal transit distance than control SD rats (54.1+/-2.6% versus 43.0+/-1.2%). Insulin treatment of SDT rats begun at 20 weeks of age produced improved stool and reduced intestinal transit distance (41.4+/-0.3%). Morphologically, the SDT rats exhibited longer villi and heavier weight of intestine compared to control SD rats. These results suggest that the SDT rat may be a useful animal model for studies of diabetic gastroenteropathy.
