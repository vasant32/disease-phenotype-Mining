 AIMS: Assess safety and glycaemic control in patients initiating insulin with, or switching from basal insulin to, biphasic insulin aspart 30/70 (BIAsp 30) in primary care in Finland. METHODS: A non-randomised, non-interventional, open-label, 26-week study of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients prescribed BIAsp 30 by their physician, who determined starting dose, titration and injection frequency. RESULTS: 496 patients provided safety data (insulin-naïve n=197; prior insulin n=299 [84.9% received NPH insulin]). Three patients (0.6%) reported four SADRs (three hypoglycaemia, one hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness). HbA1c was significantly (p<0.0001) reduced after 26 weeks' BIAsp 30 therapy (final dose): insulin-naïve -1.4% (44.4 IU); prior insulin -1.1% (77.4 IU). HbA1c<7.0% was achieved by 10% of insulin-naïve patients at baseline and 51% at 26-week follow-up. In the prior insulin group, 7% and 30% of patients had HbA1c<7.0% at baseline and 26 weeks, respectively. Minor hypoglycaemia increased significantly from baseline to study end: insulin-naïve 0.66-6.45 events/patient/year (p<0.0001); prior insulin 5.11-8.58 events/patient/year (p<0.05). Weight increased by 1.0 kg (insulin-naïve) and 1.3 kg (previous insulin). CONCLUSION: BIAsp 30, initiated and titrated in T2D patients in primary care in Finland, showed a good safety profile and significantly improved glycaemic control.
