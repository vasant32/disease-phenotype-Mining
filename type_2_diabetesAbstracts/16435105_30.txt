AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1alpha (PPARGC1A) is a transcriptional co-activator with a central role in energy expenditure and glucose metabolism. Several studies have suggested that the common PPARGC1A polymorphism Gly482Ser may be associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, with conflicting results. To clarify the role of Gly482Ser in type 2 diabetes and related human metabolic phenotypes we genotyped this polymorphism in a case-control study and performed a meta-analysis of relevant published data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gly482Ser was genotyped in a type 2 diabetes case-control study (N=1,096) using MassArray technology. A literature search revealed publications that examined Gly482Ser for association with type 2 diabetes and related metabolic phenotypes. Meta-analysis of the current study and relevant published data was undertaken. RESULTS: In the pooled meta-analysis, including data from this study and seven published reports (3,718 cases, 4,818 controls), there was evidence of between-study heterogeneity (p<0.1). In the fixed-effects meta-analysis, the pooled odds ratio for risk of type 2 diabetes per Ser482 allele was 1.07 (95% CI 1.00-1.15, p=0.044). Elimination of one of the studies from the meta-analysis gave a summary odds ratio of 1.11 (95% CI 1.04-1.20, p=0.004), with no between-study heterogeneity (p=0.475). For quantitative metabolic traits in normoglycaemic subjects, we also found significant between-study heterogeneity. However, no significant association was observed between Gly482Ser and BMI, fasting glucose or fasting insulin. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This meta-analysis of data from the current and published studies supports a modest role for the Gly482Ser PPARGC1A variant in type 2 diabetes risk.
