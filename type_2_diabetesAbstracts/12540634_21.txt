We conducted a genome scan using a 10-cM map to search for genes linked to type 2 diabetes in 691 individuals from a founder population, the Old Order Amish. We then saturated two regions on chromosomes 1 and 14 showing promising linkage signals with additional markers to produce a approximately 2-cM map for fine mapping. Analyses of both discrete traits (type 2 diabetes and the composite trait of type 2 diabetes and/or impaired glucose homeostasis [IGH]), and quantitative traits (glucose levels during a 75-g oral glucose challenge, designated glucose 0-180 and HbA(1c)) were performed. We obtained significant evidence for linkage to type 2 diabetes in a novel region on chromosome 14q11 (logarithm of odds [LOD] for diabetes = 3.48, P = 0.00005). Furthermore, we observed evidence for the existence of a diabetes-related locus on chromosome 1q21-q24 (LOD for type 2 diabetes/IGH = 2.35, P = 0.0008), a region shown to be linked to diabetes in several other studies. Suggestive evidence for linkage to glucose traits was observed on three other regions: 14q11-q13 (telomeric to that above with LOD = 1.82-1.85 for glucose 150 and 180), 1p31 (LOD = 1.28-2.30 for type 2 diabetes and glucose 120-180), and 18p (LOD = 3.07, P = 0.000085 for HbA(1c) and LOD = 1.50 for glucose 0). In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes reside on chromosomes 1, 14, and 18.
