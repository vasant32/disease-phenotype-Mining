BACKGROUND: The association between diabetes, glycaemic control and the prevalence of infections seems obvious to most general practitioners. However, this association is still not very clear. AIM: The aim of this study in general practice was to investigate which infections patients with treated type 2 diabetes present to their general practitioner, and to study whether a relationship exists between glycaemic status and these infections. METHOD: Over a period of 2 years eight fasting glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin values were related to the presented infections in 328 patients. RESULTS: 193 patients presented with one or more infections (a total of 458 infections, with a mean of 2.4 (+/- 1.9) infections). Patients with and without infections did not differ in mean glycosylated haemoglobin and fasting glucose levels. There was no difference in presentation of infections between well controlled and less controlled patients. However, patients who presented with an infection showed significantly higher mean glycosylated haemoglobin levels in that period compared to the mean levels in periods without any infection. CONCLUSION: Considering the limitations of this study, hyperglycaemia is more likely a result of than a cause of common infections.
