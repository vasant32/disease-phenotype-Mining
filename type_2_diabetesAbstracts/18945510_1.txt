 AIMS: To investigate ethnic difference by focusing on fasting serum insulin (FSI) in inter-East Asian subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and impaired glucose regulation (IGR). METHODS: Data sources included MEDLINE and EMBASE between 2001 and 2007. We conducted a search for articles containing mean or geometric mean values of FSI in East Asian subjects with NGT, IGR, or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The Monte Carlo method was used for simulation of the mean and standard deviation of individual measures in each ethnic group; calculation of the median ratio and 95% confidence interval of individual measures between ethnic groups. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles fully met our pre-determined criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis revealed that FSI level is significantly lower in Japanese subjects with NGT, IGR, or T2DM than in Korean and Chinese subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic difference in FSI level between East Asians was observed in not only T2DM patients but also subjects with NGT or IGR. The lower FSI level in Japanese subjects was accompanied by lower triglyceride level. These results suggest that ethnic difference in dietary habit was one of the most influential factors for the ethnic difference in FSI.
