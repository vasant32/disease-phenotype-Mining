 OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of an Internet-based glucose monitoring system (IBGMS) on A1C levels in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This trial involved 50 patients randomly assigned to receive either conventional treatment alone or with additional follow-up through an IBGMS for 6 months. Patients randomized to the intervention group uploaded blood glucose readings every 2 weeks to a secure Web site for review and receipt of feedback from their endocrinologist. A1C and laboratory test results were collected at 0, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: The baseline parameters were not significantly different. Over a 6-month follow-up, A1C dropped from 8.8 to 7.6% (P < 0.001) in the intervention group compared with 8.5 to 8.4% (P = 0.51) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IBGMS significantly improved A1C levels in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin.
