A 48-year-old man with a 14-year history of type 2 diabetes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and distal symmetrical diabetic polyneuropathy visited our hospital. Eight months later, he subacutely developed difficulty in both shoulder movement and trouble standing up from a squatting position. This was accompanied by severe bilateral shoulder and thigh pain. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, cervical and lumbar spine, computed tomography of the shoulder and X-ray films of the cervical spine and shoulder revealed no abnormality. Cerebrospinal fluid showed a mild elevation of protein (0.93 g/l) without cell infiltration. Antiganglioside antibodies and point mutation of mitochondrial DNA at position 3243 were not found. Neuropathology of the sural nerve showed a moderate myelinated fiber loss, active axonal degeneration, but onion-bulb formation, endoneurial or epineurial vasculitis were not observed. Electromyography revealed neurogenic changes in the proximal upper limb muscles. Nerve conduction studies revealed mild bilateral slowing in nerve conduction velocity in both of the upper and lower limbs. The diagnosis of this patients was suspected to be a proximal diabetic neuropathy (diabetic amyotrophy). The pain and muscle weakness had persisted more severely in the shoulder than in the thigh throughout the clinical course. His unbearable symptoms could be partially alleviated by an administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluvoxamine maleate. Proximal diabetic neuropathy is a rare disabling type of neuropathy, which is characterized with subacute bilateral muscle weakness and wasting in the proximal part of the lower limbs. The involvement of the scapulohumeral region observed in this case is very unusual in proximal diabetic neuropathy.
