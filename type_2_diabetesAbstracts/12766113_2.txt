 OBJECTIVE: Control of hypertension in patients with diabetic nephropathy improves mortality and slows progression to end-stage renal disease. However, blood pressure is difficult to treat; multiple drug combination therapy is required and treatment algorithms to establish this are lacking. We used a stepped-care algorithm, centered on maximum doses of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, to treat hypertension according to American Diabetes Association recommended blood pressure target goals (<130/80 mmHg) in patients with diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We treated 49 consecutive patients with diabetes (13 with type 1 and 36 with type 2), diabetic nephropathy, and proteinuria > or =500 mg/24 h with a stepped-care blood pressure treatment algorithm. The level of blood pressure control achieved at most recent follow-up was assessed. RESULTS: Patients were followed for a median of 18 months (range 9-48). Mean blood pressure achieved was 140/75 +/- 23/14 mmHg in patients with type 1 diabetes and 146/76 +/- 22/14 mmHg in patients with type 2 diabetes. Target blood pressure was reached in 16 (33%) patients, 6 of 13 patients with type 1 diabetes and 10 of 36 patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas systolic blood pressure remained above the target level in the remaining patients. There was no difference in baseline blood pressure, proteinuria, or serum creatinine level between patients who were treated to target and those who were not. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of blood pressure control similar to those achieved in clinical trials in diabetic nephropathy were obtained with a stepped-care algorithm. However, in most patients, systolic blood pressure was difficult to control to target despite the use of multiple drug combination therapy.
