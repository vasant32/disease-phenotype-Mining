A growing body of evidence on diabetes screening has been published during the last 10 years. Type 2 diabetes meets many but not all of the criteria for screening. Concerns about potential harms of screening have largely been resolved. Screening identifies a high-risk population with the potential to gain from widely available interventions. However, in spite of the findings of modelling studies, the size of the benefit of earlier initiation of treatment and the overall cost-effectiveness remains uncertain, in contrast to other screening programmes (such as for abdominal aortic aneurysms) that are yet to be fully implemented. There is also uncertainty about optimal specifications and implementation of a screening programme, and further work to complete concerning development and delivery of individual- and population-level preventive strategies. While there is growing evidence of the net benefit of earlier detection of individuals with prevalent but undiagnosed diabetes, there remains limited justification for a policy of universal population-based screening for type 2 diabetes at the present time. Data from ongoing studies should inform the key assumptions in existing modelling studies and further reduce uncertainty.
