 AIMS: To determine whether lower postprandial glucose (PPG) levels after intake of a diabetes-specific formula (DSF) compared with a standard formula were maintained after 4 weeks use. METHODS: Randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study. Forty-four type 2 diabetes patients on oral anti-diabetes medication consumed 2×200mL/day of a DSF (Diasip(®)) or an isocaloric standard, fiber-containing formula for 4 weeks. PPG responses were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks by iAUC and (delta) peak glucose concentrations. RESULTS: PPG response was significantly lower in the DSF group after first intake and remained significantly lower after 4 weeks use. Postprandial insulin, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, fructosamine and lipid levels did not differ between groups after 4 weeks. Within the standard group, fasting glucose and HOMA(IR) significantly increased over the intervention period. Changes in body weight between groups were significantly different, with an increase in the standard group. Both products were equally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Superior PPG control by DSF was maintained after 4 weeks use, showing that this formula has added value with respect to PPG control for type 2 diabetes patients compared to a standard, fiber-containing formula. The observed effects on body weight, fasting glucose and HOMA(IR) may further support the use of a DSF.
