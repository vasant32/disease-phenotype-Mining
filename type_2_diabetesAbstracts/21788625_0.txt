 OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of a novel soy germ-enriched pasta, containing isoflavone aglycons, with conventional pasta on endothelial function and cardiovascular risk markers in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This randomized controlled double-blind crossover study compared one serving/day of soy germ pasta and conventional pasta for 8 weeks for effects on brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation, blood pressure, plasma lipids, oxidized LDL cholesterol, 8-iso-PGF2α, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione (GSH), and homocysteine. RESULTS: Isoflavone-enriched pasta significantly improved arterial stiffness (P = 0.005) and reduced systolic (P = 0.026) and diastolic (P = 0.017) blood pressures. Plasma TAC increased (P = 0.0002), oxidized LDL cholesterol decreased (P = 0.009), 8-iso-PGF2α decreased (P = 0.001), GSH levels increased (P = 0.0003), and homocysteine decreased (P = 0.009) consistent with a reduction in oxidative stress. No significant changes were observed with conventional pasta. CONCLUSIONS: Pasta enriched with biologically active isoflavone aglycons improved endothelial function and had beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk markers in patients with T2D.
