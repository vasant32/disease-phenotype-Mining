We conducted a 4-month randomised controlled trial of home-based resistance training using exercise bands, amongst people with type 2 diabetes and co-morbidities limiting aerobic exercise capacity. The intervention did not improve HbA1c, anthropometric variables or functional capacity. We conclude that short-term use of exercise bands does not improve glycaemic control.
