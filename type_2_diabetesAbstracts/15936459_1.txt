Betacellulin (BTC), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, is an important factor in the growth and/or differentiation of pancreatic beta cells. In this point of view, we determined the transcriptional start site of the human BTC gene and screened the protein-coding region for mutations. The transcriptional start site was located 347 bp upstream from the translational initiation codon. After screening the protein coding exons (exons 1-5), we identified two novel missense mutations, Cys (TGC) to Gly (GGC) at codon 7 (C7G) and Leu (TTG) to Met (ATG) at codon 124 (L124M), and a single nucleotide substitution (-31c/t) in the intron 2. The C7G was located in the signal peptide and the L124M in the transmembrane domain and this Leu at codon 124 was conserved among human, bovine, rat, and mouse. The frequencies of these variants, however, were similar between type 2 diabetic patients (n = 228) and non-diabetic control subjects (n = 170). These data suggest that genetic variations in the protein-coding region of the human BTC gene are unlikely to be a major contributor to development of type 2 diabetes.
