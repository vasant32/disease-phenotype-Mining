 OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that simvastatin reduces the levels of circulating immune complexes (ICs) containing modified lipoproteins (mLDLs; mLDL-ICs), which may represent an additional mechanism for the reduced incidence of cardiovascular events in patients treated with simvastatin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 26 patients with type 2 diabetes and triglyceride levels <400 mg/dl who were not receiving lipid-lowering medications or CYP 3A4 inhibitors were enrolled in the study. After 2 weeks on a lipid-lowering diet and exercise, the patients were started on simvastatin 20 mg/day. The dose of simvastatin was adjusted until the levels of LDL cholesterol were < or =100 mg/dl. Blood was collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after LDL cholesterol levels reached target, and 3 months after stopping simvastatin to measure advanced glycation end product LDL and oxidized LDL antibodies, mLDL-IC, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), lipid profile, liver function tests, creatinine kinase, glucose, and HbA(1c). RESULTS: Twenty-one patients completed the study. Their HbA(1c) remained within 1% of baseline levels. There was a highly significant decrease in mLDL-IC levels after 3 and 6 months of treatment with simvastatin, with a return to near baseline levels after discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Simvastatin significantly reduced the concentration of mLDL-IC, probably as a consequence of both a decrease in the formation of mLDL and to a reduction in the titers of mLDL antibodies. This effect is likely to have a beneficial impact in the inflammatory reaction associated with atherosclerosis.
