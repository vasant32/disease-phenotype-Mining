Basal insulin therapy is an integral part of the intensive management of type 1 diabetes and it is also often used in type 2 diabetes. An ideal insulin regimen in patients with diabetes would mirror the 24-h insulin profile of a non-diabetic person, thereby preventing hyperglycaemia without inducing hypoglycaemia. Until recently, available insulins have pharmacokinetic disadvantages, compared to physiological insulin secretion. Insulin detemir is a new basal insulin analogue recently available for commercial use in the UK. Clinical trials have demonstrated lower fasting plasma glucose levels, lower variability in plasma glucose, predictable action profile and a reduced risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia and weight gain, compared to conventional basal insulins. This study reviews the properties and potential use of insulin detemir.
