There is evidence for increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes among cigarette smokers. In addition, smoking-associated health risks can exacerbate major conditions that precede or accompany diabetes, such as cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Smoking cessation can result in weight gain and a short-term worsening of some diabetic symptoms that may deter smokers with diabetes from attempting to quit. Additionally, there is limited evidence regarding the efficacy/safety of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies in this population and the general effects of smoking cessation, particularly for type 1 diabetes. Smoking cessation in diabetes therefore remains a highly relevant subject for further research.
