Resistance exercise is recommended as part of the exercise guidelines to prevent and manage type 2 diabetes (T2D), however, the frequency of exercise required to improve glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity is not clear. We recruited and tested 10 individuals with T2D by collecting a fasting blood sample immediately prior to, a whole-body moderate-high intensity resistance exercise session, and 24, 48 and 72 h afterwards. No changes to estimates of insulin sensitivity (HOMA2), glucose or insulin were observed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (p > 0.05). Further, there were no changes observed to markers of inflammation at 24 h following the resistance exercise session (p > 0.05). These findings suggest that insulin sensitivity is not acutely modified, positively or negatively, at 24, 48 or 72 h after a bout of resistance exercise. Nor are markers of inflammation altered during this time frame in a way that could cause transient insulin resistance.
