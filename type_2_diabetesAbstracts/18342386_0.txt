 AIMS: The aim of study was to assess the impact of intensive diabetic care, defined as target values for fasting glucose of 60-90mg/dl and 1-h postprandial glucose of below 130mg/dl, on neonatal birth weight in relation to risk indicators for fetal macrosomia in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: In women with (N=543) and without GDM (N=1011) age, height, weight, previous GDM, history of macrosomia, family history of type 2 diabetes, parity and weight gain during pregnancy were recorded. RESULTS: Neonatal birth weight and frequency distribution of macrosomia and infants with small for gestational age did not differ between women with and without GDM. Neonatal birth weight was strongly associated with traditional risk predictors for GDM, such like prior macrosomia (OR 5.03; 95%CI 3.36-7.53), prior GDM (OR 2.52; 95%CI 1.37-4.64) and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI)>23kg/m(2) (OR 1.82; 95%CI 1.27-2.63). CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal birth weight and the incidence of macrosomia were similar in comparison of pregnancies with and without GDM. In the population of Caucasian women the strongest single predictors for macrosomia were prior macrosomia, BMI>23kg/m(2) and prior GDM.
