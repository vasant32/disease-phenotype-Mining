This report examined whether daily acetic acid ingestion as vinegar, dill pickle, or commercial vinegar pill influenced hemoglobin A1c in diabetic patients. Hemoglobin A1c values fell 0.16% with vinegar use but rose 0.06% and 0.22% for pill and pickle use respectively (p=0.018). Hence, regular vinegar use modestly improved glycemic control.
