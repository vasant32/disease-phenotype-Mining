 AIM: To clarify the association between serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Two hundred seventy nine patients with type 2 diabetes were consecutively enrolled and metabolic parameters were checked. High-grade NAFLD was defined as moderate or severe fatty liver disease, measured using liver ultrasound. SHBG, testosterone, and estradiol levels were measured. RESULTS: SHBG levels were lower in patients with high-grade NAFLD than in those with normal ultrasound and decreased significantly based on the severity of fatty liver disease. SHBG levels were negatively correlated with hypertension, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, high-grade NAFLD, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-glutamyltransferase (γGT), homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) and were positively correlated with testosterone and estradiol levels. The odds ratios (ORs) predicting the presence of high-grade NAFLD in men and women decreased significantly with increasing SHBG tertile. The ORs remained significant even after further adjusting for BMI, waist circumference, hypertension, triglycerides, γGT, ALT, CRP, HOMA-IR, testosterone, estradiol, and anti-diabetic medications. CONCLUSIONS: Serum SHBG levels were independently associated with the high-grade NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes.
