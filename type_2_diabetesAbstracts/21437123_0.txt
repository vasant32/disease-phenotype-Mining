Treatment to target fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial glucose (PPG) and HbA(1c) are essential in the management of type 2 diabetes to reduce the risk of vascular complications. Early combination therapy with oral agents is increasingly being seen as important to achieve this. Repaglinide, a rapid-acting insulin secretagogue, targets PPG, and metformin, an insulin sensitizer, targets FBG. Because of their complementary modes of action these therapies are frequently given as combination therapy in separate tablets. To overcome the issues with adherence to multiple tablets, repaglinide and metformin are now available in a fixed-dose combination (FDC). Repaglinide/metformin FDC is bioequivalent to each tablet given separately, suggesting that the efficacy and safety profile is similar. There is no effect of food on repaglinide when in the FDC. Repaglinide/metformin FDC is as effective in reducing HbA(1c) and FBG whether given twice or three times daily, with a similar safety profile. Repaglinide/metformin FDC twice daily is as effective in reducing HbA(1c) and FBG as rosiglitazone/metformin FDC with a similar safety profile, but unlike the rosiglitazone/metformin FDC, repaglinide/metformin FDC improves the lipid profile. Repaglinide/metformin FDC represents a new option in the pursuit of achieving glucose targets and reducing vascular risk in type 2 diabetes, with the advantage of improving adherence.
