AIM: Two adiponectin receptors (ADIPORs), ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2, are widely expressed in tissues. Whether changes in the expression of ADIPORs are associated with obesity and insulin resistance in humans is still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore whether lymphocyte ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 mRNA expression is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, first-phase insulin secretion and serum adiponectin levels. METHODS: Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we measured ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 mRNA levels in the lymphocytes of 59 obese patients, of whom 39 had normal glucose tolerance, 8 had impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose, and 12 had type 2 diabetes, and of 21 women with restrictive anorexia nervosa. RESULTS: In all subjects, ADIPOR1 expression was 2.2-fold higher than that of ADIPOR2 (p < 0.0001). The mRNA expression level of both receptors correlated with each other (p < 0.0001). After adjustment for age and sex, lymphocyte ADIPORs mRNA expression (ADIPOR1, p < 0.005; ADIPOR2, p < 0.05) and serum adiponectin (p < 0.0001) were significantly lower in obese patients than in anorexic subjects. In a multivariate analysis with ADIPOR1 as the dependent variable and body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and adiponectin as the independent variables, only serum adiponectin remained positively and independently correlated with ADIPOR1 (p < 0.05). Adiponectin was independently and negatively related to BMI and sex. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated in this study that lymphocytes express ADIPORs and that, similar to serum adiponectin, ADIPORs expression is markedly reduced in obese subjects. ADIPORs expression is not independently related to BMI, insulin resistance and beta-cell function.
