To investigate the anti-atherogenic effect of metformin, we prospectively evaluated the effect of metformin treatment on common carotid intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) in patients with type 2 diabetes. A 2-year open prospective study was performed. Thirty-six patients were treated with metformin (500-750 mg per day). CCA-IMT was measured after 1- and 2-year treatment. Changes in CCA-IMT were compared with control patients. After 2-year metformin therapy, the progression of CCA-IMT was significantly less than 56 control patients (0.02+/-0.08 mm versus 0.07+/-0.08 mm, P<0.01). Metformin therapy did not alter body weight, blood pressure, HbA1c, and serum lipids relative to the control. Thus, metformin attenuates the progression of CCA-IMT. This anti-atherogenic effect is not mediated through changes in classical cardiovascular risk factors.
