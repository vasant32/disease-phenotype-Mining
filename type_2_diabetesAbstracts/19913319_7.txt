This article aims to provide an updated summary of diabetes prevention efforts by reviewing relevant literature published between 2007 and 2009. These include results from the long-term follow-up of diabetes prevention trials and the roll-out of community-based interventions in "real world" settings. Some countries have begun to implement population-based strategies for chronic disease prevention, but investment in developing and evaluating population-level interventions remains inadequate. By focussing on the "small change" approach and involving a number of different agencies, it may be possible to shift the population distribution of risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in a favourable direction. The cost-effectiveness of primary prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes has not been universally demonstrated. Some of the uncertainties relating to screening for diabetes have now been resolved but longer-term data on hard cardiovascular outcomes are still needed. In summary, individual countries should aim to develop and evaluate cost-effective, setting-specific diabetes risk identification and prevention strategies based on available resources. These should be linked to initiatives aimed at reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease, and complemented with population-based strategies focusing on the control and reduction of behavioural and cardiovascular risk factors by targeting their key determinants.
