Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a key regulating factor of lipid metabolism, and the polymorphism of its gene may therefore be a candidate for modulating the lipid parameters, altering the susceptibility to atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic subjects. In a group of 443 unrelated Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, we studied the B1B2 polymorphism at the CETP locus, which is detectable with the restriction enzyme TaqI. Patients were separated into three groups according to genotype and compared based on their clinical characteristics, lipid parameters, and macrovascular complications. The B2 allele was associated in a dose-dependent fashion with higher HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI levels, together with lower CETP concentrations. Furthermore, the prevalence of macrovascular complications, such as coronary heart disease, arteriosclerosis obliterans, and cerebral vascular disease, was significantly higher in subjects with the B1B1 genotype. Multiple logistic regression analysis also showed that the B1 allele of CETP genotype was associated with the incidence of these three complications independently of other risk factors. Thus, in type 2 diabetic patients, the B1B2 polymorphism of CETP gene is likely to be a strong genetic predictor of macrovascular complications.
