Although it has been hypothesized that initial hyperperfusion followed by late hypoperfusion in islet circulation occurs in rodent models of type 2 diabetes, islet blood flow has not been measured during prediabetic phase. We studied islet blood flow in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of slowly progressive obese type 2 diabetes. Islet blood flow was measured by the two-color microsphere method under anesthesia at different ages. Islet blood flow was significantly higher in young OLETF rats compared with control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats when the former were not obese or diabetic and had normal insulin secretion at 5 weeks of age (LETO 4.6 +/- 1.1, OLETF 8.8 +/- 1.2 ml. min(-1). mg(- 1), P < 0.01). At 6 months of age, islet hyperperfusion was observed in OLETF rats, and >40% of whole pancreatic blood flow was diverted into islets in OLETF rats. Prevention of obesity by food restriction increased basal islet blood flow. On the other hand, long-term hyperglycemia induced by sucrose feeding decreased fractional islet blood flow as well as glucose-stimulated islet blood flow. Our results indicate that hyperperfusion is present during the preobese and prediabetic phase in our type 2 diabetes rats.
