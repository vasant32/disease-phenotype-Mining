We performed a meta-analysis of five randomized, placebo-controlled trials to characterize the impact of plant sterols/stanols on plasma lipids in patients with type 2 diabetes. Upon meta-analysis, plant sterols/stanols significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol, with a trend towards improvement in HDL. No beneficial effect on triglycerides was apparent.
