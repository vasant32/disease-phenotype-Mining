The aim of our study was to compare the effect of captopril--the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, nifedipine--the calcium antagonist, and prazosin--the alpha blocker, on the secretory function of pancreatic beta-cells in hypertensive patients with NIDDM and with normal glucose tolerance. The effect of a 2-week treatment with nifedipine, captopril and prazosin upon glycaemia, serum insulin (IRI) and C-peptide (CP) following oral and intravenous glucose load were investigated in three groups, each including 10 non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension (h) and 10 hypertensive type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetics (h + d), aged 32-63 years. Nifedipine produced increase in glycaemia in the oral test in both groups. In the (h) group, but not in the (h + d) group, the drug caused reduction of the glucose-dependent increases in serum IRI and CP, more marked with respect to CP, as expressed by the decrease in the molar serum CP/IRI ratio. These results indicate that in non-diabetic patients, nifedipine reduces the early response of beta-cells to glucose, but this effect is partly compensated by a decreased insulin uptake by the liver. In patients with type 2 diabetes, this phenomenon does not become manifest because of absence or reduction in the early glucose-dependent insulin release. After captopril, lower values of glycaemia and serum IRI and CP were observed in both groups suggesting an improvement of insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, nifedipine has a small influence, and captopril and prazosin are devoided of any influence on the secretory function of pancreatic beta-cells. These drugs may be recommended for the treatment of hypertension in patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.
