AIM: This study examined a possible association of the T/G polymorphism at nucleotide 94 in the adiponectin gene with the prevalence of diabetic complications. METHODS: The study was performed in 696 patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Genotyping was performed by means of polymerase chain reaction and subsequent cleavage by using SmaI restriction endonuclease. RESULTS: The 94G/G genotype was significantly more prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes (2.2%) than in type 1 diabetics (0.0%) (p = 0.02), whereas no differences were found for frequencies of the 94T/T and the 94G/T genotypes, respectively. In patients with type 1 diabetes, 45 of 239 patients were heterozygous for the 94T/G polymorphism (carrier rate (CR): 18.8%; allele frequency (AF): 0.094). In type 2 diabetics, 71 of 457 patients were heterozygous and 10 patients were homozygous for the 94G/G genotype (CR: 17.7%; AF: 0.10). No association with diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy or diabetic retinopathy was found for either genotype in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The 94T/G polymorphism in the adiponectin gene is not associated with diabetic complications. The significance of a higher prevalence of the G allele in type 2, compared to type 1 diabetes remains to be clarified.
