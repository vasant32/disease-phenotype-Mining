 BACKGROUND AND AIM: In vivo and in vitro experimental findings indicate that the hyperglycemic diabetic milieu can induce altered expression of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes and contribute to imbalances in vascular matrix homeostasis. We examined the plasma levels of enzymes and inhibitors involved in extracellular matrix turnover. METHODS: We measured the plasma concentrations of MMP-2, MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) in 80 type-2 diabetic subjects without uremia and in 80 age-matched controls. In addition, we determined the plasma levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and high sensitive(hs) C-reactive protein (CRP) in both groups. RESULTS: Plasma MMP-2, TIMP-1, and hs-CRP concentrations were significantly elevated in diabetic patients as compared to the control subjects (p<0.05). Plasma levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and hs-CRP were found not to be significantly associated with age, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, or serum lipid concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma MMP-2, TIMP-1 and hs-CRP concentrations were significantly increased in type-2 diabetic patients.
