 AIM: This study evaluated changes in clinical effectiveness measures of patients with type 2 diabetes initiating exenatide therapy in a real-world setting. METHODS: Eligible patients identified in the General Electric (GE) electronic medical record (EMR) research database from 1 January 2000 through 31 December 2007 were > or =18 years old with type 2 diabetes. Patients had prescription orders in the previous 395 days for metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione as monotherapy or in combination, and had at least 6 months of follow-up activity. Baseline clinical measures were documented from 45 days prior up to 15 days after exenatide initiation and follow-up measures documented at 6 months +/- 45 days. RESULTS: A total of 1709 patients were identified for study inclusion. The overall mean A1C reduction (s.e.m.) at 6 months was -0.8% (0.05) (p<0.001), weight loss was -3.2 kg (0.14) (p<0.001), blood pressure (BP) lowering was -1.9 mmHg (0.46) systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p<0.001) and -0.5 mmHg (0.27) diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p = 0.078). Changes in low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides and HDL were -7.4 mg/dl (1.7) (p<0.001), -23.2 mg/dl (6.7) (p = 0.001) and -0.8 mg/dl (0.33) (p = 0.012) respectively. In a quartile analysis by weight loss, mean A1C reduction ranged from -1.1 to -0.65% in the highest to lowest weight loss quartiles respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, exenatide initiation is associated with significant improvements in the measures of clinical effectiveness for type 2 diabetes. These reductions were comparable to those reported in randomized, controlled registration trials after 6 months of therapy.
