 OBJECTIVE: Chronic low-grade activation of the immune system (CLAIS) predicts type 2 diabetes via a decrease in insulin sensitivity. Our study investigated potential relationships between nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways-two pathways proposed as the link between CLAIS and insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adiposity (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and insulin sensitivity (M, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) were measured in 22 healthy nondiabetic volunteers (aged 29 +/- 11 years, body fat 28 +/- 11%). NF-kappaB activity (DNA-binding assay) and JNK1/2 activity (phosphorylated JNK) were assessed in biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue and in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lysates. RESULTS: NF-kappaB activities in PBMCs and muscle were positively associated with WHR after adjustment for age, sex, and percent body fat (both P < 0.05). NF-kappaB activity in PBMCs was inversely associated with M after adjustment for age, sex, percent body fat, and WHR (P = 0.02) and explained 16% of the variance of M. There were no significant relationships between NF-kappaB activity and M in muscle or adipose tissue (both NS). Adipose-derived JNK1/2 activity was not associated with obesity (all P> 0.1), although it was inversely related to M (r = -0.54, P < 0.05) and explained 29% of its variance. When both NF-kappaB and JNK1/2 were examined statistically, only JNK1/2 activity in adipose tissue was a significant determinant of insulin resistance (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: JNK1/2 activity in adipose tissue but not NF-kappaB activity in PBMCs is an independent determinant of insulin resistance in healthy individuals.
