 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To aim of the study was to investigate the effect of bilio-pancreatic diversion (BPD) on type 2 diabetes in patients with BMI <35 kg/m(2). METHODS: OGTTs were performed and anthropometric data were compared between five diabetes patients (BMI 27-33 kg/m(2)) following BPD and seven diabetes patients after a low-energy diet. Insulin secretion was computed by C-peptide deconvolution. A euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp was performed only in the BPD group and the M value measured. RESULTS: One month after BPD, fasting and 2 h post-OGTT glycaemia decreased from 15.22 +/- 3.22 to 6.22 +/- 0.51 mmol/l (p = 0.043), while insulin sensitivity increased significantly. No significant changes were observed in the low-energy diet group. Insulin secretion did not differ significantly after either intervention. Diabetes amelioration (change in HbA(1c) level) was observed up to 18 months after BPD without pharmacological therapy. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: BPD can achieve adequate control of type 2 diabetes also in patients with BMI <35 kg/m(2). The rapid postoperative remission of diabetes is primarily related to an improvement in insulin sensitivity.
