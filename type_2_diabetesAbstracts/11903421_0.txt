In the United States, approximately 16 million people have diabetes; 90-95% have type 2 diabetes. They are at increased risk of developing hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The benefits of treating hypertension in diabetic patients and the potential to delay complications and reduce mortality have been demonstrated in clinical trials. Increasing evidence shows that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs) may be equally effective in delaying progressive renal disease in diabetic patients. Large, multicentre trials are ongoing to confirm the efficacy and superior safety profile of ARBs in this population.
