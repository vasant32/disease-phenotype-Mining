 AIM: To investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LY2189265 (LY), a novel, long-acting glucagen-like peptide-1 analogue, administered once weekly to subjects with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This was a placebo-controlled, parallel-group, subject- and investigator-blind study of LY in subjects (N = 43) with type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with diet and exercise alone or with a single oral antidiabetic medication. Subjects taking metformin or thiazolidinediones continued on their therapy. Subjects receiving sulfonylurea, acarbose, repaglinide or nateglinide were switched to metformin prior to enrollment. Subjects received five once-weekly doses of 0.05, 0.3, 1, 3, 5 or 8 mg. Effects on glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations were determined during fasting and following standard test meals. The pharmacokinetics of LY and its effects on HBA1c, glucagon, body weight, gastric emptying and safety parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Once-weekly administration of LY significantly reduced (p < 0.01) fasting plasma glucose, 2-h post-test meal postprandial glucose and area under the curve (AUC) of glucose after test meals at doses â‰¥1 mg. These effects were seen after the first dose and were sustained through the weekly dosing cycle. Most doses produced statistically significant increases in insulin and C-peptide AUC when normalized for glucose AUC. Statistically significant reductions in HBA1c were observed for all dose groups except 0.3 mg. The most commonly reported adverse effects (AEs) were nausea (35 events), headache (20 events), vomiting (18 events) and diarrhoea (8 events). CONCLUSIONS: LY showed improvement in fasting and postprandial glycaemic parameters when administered once weekly in subjects with type 2 diabetes. The pharmacokinetics and safety profiles also support further investigation of this novel agent.
