 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPARgamma gene was associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in the Nurses' Health Study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was a nested case-control study of 387 incident cases of type 2 diabetes and 771 matching control subjects nested within the Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort study. Association between PPARgamma genotype and incident type 2 diabetes was estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Carriers of the PPARgamma variant 12Ala allele had reduced risk of type 2 diabetes compared with noncarriers. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of type 2 diabetes were 0.74 (95% CI 0.55-1.00) and 0.72 (0.52-0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide further support for an inverse association between the PPARgamma variant 12Ala allele and risk of type 2 diabetes.
