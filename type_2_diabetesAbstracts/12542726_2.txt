AIM: Pioglitazone is considered to reduce insulin resistance. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and clinical profile of pioglitazone in patients whose type 2 diabetes were poorly controlled with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor alone or alpha-glucosidase in combination with sulfonylurea. METHODS: Twenty patients with type 2 diabetes were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg q.d.) orally for 16 weeks. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in HbA1C, FPG and postprandial plasma glucose at week 16. As adverse events, oedema, hypoglycaemia-like reaction, increases in LDH, CPK, etc. were noted. There was no significant change in TNF-alpha. Leptin levels increased significantly at week 16 and were still increasing 4 weeks after the treatment. Per cent body fat was almost constant throughout the study period. When efficacy was classified by demographic variables, pioglitazone was found to be more effective in the subjects who had a higher postprandial 2-h plasma glucose level, leptin level or per cent body fat value. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone was considered to be effective when used in patients whose type 2 diabetes were poorly controlled with alpha-glucosidase inhibitor alone or alpha-glucosidase in combination with sulfonylurea.
