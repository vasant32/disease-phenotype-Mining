 OBJECTIVE: To compare mortality risks among type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients being treated with glibenclamide, gliclazide, or glimepiride. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort studies of primary care-based diabetes register were carried out. Risk of total and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality was evaluated in cohort of T2D patients that were treated with either glibenclamide (n=50,341), glimepiride (n=2479) or gliclazide (n=11,368). Cox regression was used for multifactor evaluation. A cross-sectional evaluation of oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) structure for 2005 and 2007 was also performed, as well as age at the time of death was compared in the timeframe between 2002 and 2007. RESULTS: Total mortality was lower for gliclazide and glimepiride, vs. glibenclamide cohort: HRs 0.33 (95% CI 0.26-0.41), p<0.001 and 0.605 (95% CI 0.413-0.886), p<0.01 respectively. CVD mortality risk reduction vs. glibenclamide was significant only in gliclazide cohort: 0.29 (95% CI 0.21-0.38), p<0.001. Glibenclamide prescriptions had changed from 64.0% (95% CI 63.5-64.5) to 59.5% (95% CI 9.7-10.4). Age at the time of death for OAD-treated patients increased by 6.27 (95% CI 3.67-8.87)yrs, p<0.001. CONCLUSION: Glibenclamide treatment of T2D is associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality, vs. gliclazide or glimepiride treatment, and CVD mortality, vs. gliclazide treatment.
