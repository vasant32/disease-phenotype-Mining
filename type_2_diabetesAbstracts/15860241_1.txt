OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to document physical activity (PA) of migrant Mexican women with type 2 diabetes who have participated in diabetes intervention programs at a primary care level. METHODS: One hundred out of 133 women of seven diabetes education groups from different Mexican institutions located in the city of Tijuana were invited to participate in the study. A PA history questionnaire was completed weekly. Metabolic Equivalents (METs) were used to calculate physical activity level (PAL). RESULTS: Forty percent were classified as overweight and 31% as obese. Six percent of the women performed more than 150 min of moderate/vigorous weekly PA, while more than 80 min of weekly PA was reported by 73% of the population. There was no difference in frequency and intensity of PA between the participants from both institutions. The main indoor activities were cooking, dish washing, clothes washing and cleaning, and the main outdoor activities were walking, semi-active exercise and running. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of these migrant women who participated in the diabetes intervention program seem to engage in the minimum recommended levels of PA. In a country like Mexico, where its public health care system is facing huge economic constraints, PA counseling done in a primary health care practice may be a cost-effective approach.
