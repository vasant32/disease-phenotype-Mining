We review mechanisms of beta-cell failure in type 2 diabetes. A wealth of information indicates that it is caused by impaired insulin secretion and decreased beta-cell mass. Interestingly, there appears to be a link between these two mechanisms. The earliest reaction to peripheral insulin resistance is an increase in insulin production, owing primarily to increased secretion, and to a lesser extent to decreased clearance. Experimental animal models indicate that hyperinsulinaemia promotes an increase in beta-cell mass, largely via increased beta-cell replication. In contrast, following the onset of overt diabetes, there is a slowly progressive loss of beta-cell function and mass, both in animal models and in diabetic humans. It is of great interest that most diabetes-associated genes identified in genome-wide association studies appear to be enriched in the beta-cell and to have the potential to regulate mass and/or function. Here, we review evidence derived from experimental animal models to unravel the mechanisms underlying beta-cell dysfunction. We focus primarily on signalling pathways, as opposed to nutrient sensing, and specifically on the notion that insulin and growth factor signalling via Foxo1 in pancreatic beta-cells links insulin secretion with cellular proliferation and survival.
