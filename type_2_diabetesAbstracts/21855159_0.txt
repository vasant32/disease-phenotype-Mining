 AIM: To examine the relationship between early-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) and retinopathy in relation to the burden, severity, the extent of its premature development and associated predictive risk factors. METHODS: A cross sectional study using the hospital diabetes register and eye screening database to identify T2D subjects and to ascertain retinopathy severity. Early and later-onset cohort were defined as age of diagnosis <40 and >40 years respectively. RESULTS: 2516 subjects were identified of which 455 were diagnosed below 40 years. After 10 years of diagnosis, the prevalence of overall retinopathy was significantly higher in the early-onset cohort (p < 0.05). For significant retinopathy (SigDR), there was a non-significant trend of higher prevalence with increasing diabetes duration in the early-onset cohort. The rate of increase for SigDR was greater in the early-onset cohort who experienced similar burden of SigDR up to 20 years earlier than the later-onset cohort. Hypertension (p < 0.05), suboptimal glycaemic control (p < 0.05) and long diabetes duration (p < 0.05) were associated with risk of retinopathy whilst lower age of diagnosis and dyslipidaemia were not significant predictive factors. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset T2D subjects are at risk of developing premature retinopathy driven predominantly by hypertension and prolonged exposure to suboptimal diabetes control.
