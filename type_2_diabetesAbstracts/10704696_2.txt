The finding that glomerular mesangial cells produce human type I collagen suggests that the serum levels of carboxy-terminal propeptide of human type I procollagen (P1CP) may reflect the severity of diabetic nephropathy. We therefore investigated the relationship between serum P1CP levels and the extent of diabetic complications in 100 patients (46 males and 54 females) with Type 2 diabetes and in 64 healthy subjects. Serum P1CP was determined by radioimmunoassay. In diabetes, we defined P1CP levels less than 142 ng/ml as a normal P1CP group (group A), whereas we defined them as equal to or greater than 142 ng/ml as a high P1CP group (group B). The diabetic patients had significantly elevated serum P1CP levels compared with the controls. The prevalence of hypertension, proliferative diabetic retinopathy or macroalbuminuria was significantly higher in group B than in group A. Serum P1CP levels showed a significant positive correlation with urinary albumin excretion, but not with fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A(1c) or serum osteocalcin. Macroalbuminuric patients showed significantly higher P1CP levels than the normoalbuminuric patients. In patients in the absence of diabetic nephropathy, no significant differences of P1CP levels were found among the severity of diabetic retinopathy. The present results suggest that serum P1CP levels reflect the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
