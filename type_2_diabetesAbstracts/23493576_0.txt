Diabetes is associated with persistent inflammation and defective tissue repair responses. The hypothesis of this study was that IL-1β is part of a pro-inflammatory positive feedback loop that sustains a persistent pro-inflammatory wound macrophage phenotype which contributes to impaired healing in diabetes. Macrophages isolated from wounds in diabetic humans and mice exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype, including expression and secretion of IL-1β. The diabetic wound environment appears to be sufficient to induce these inflammatory phenomena as in vitro studies demonstrated that conditioned medium of both mouse and human wounds upregulates expression of pro-inflammatory genes and downregulates expression of pro-healing factors in cultured macrophages. Furthermore, inhibiting the IL-1β pathway using a neutralizing antibody and macrophages from IL1 receptor knockout mice blocked the conditioned medium-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and downregulation of pro-healing factors. Importantly, inhibiting the IL-1β pathway in wounds of diabetic mice using a neutralizing antibody induced a switch from pro-inflammatory to healing-associated macrophage phenotypes, increased levels of wound growth factors and improved healing of these wounds. Our findings indicate that targeting the IL-1β pathway represents a new therapeutic approach for improving the healing of diabetic wounds.
