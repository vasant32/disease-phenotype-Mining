Objective: GPR40 is a G protein-coupled receptor regulating free fatty acid-induced insulin secretion. We have generated transgenic mice overexpressing the human GPR40 gene (hGPR40-Tg) under control of the mouse insulin II promoter and have used them to examine the role of GPR40 in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Research Design and Methods: Normal (C57BL/6J) and diabetic (KK) mice overexpressing the human GPR40 gene under control of the insulin II promoter were generated, and their glucose metabolism and islet function were analyzed. Results: In comparison with nontransgenic littermates, hGPR40-Tg mice exhibited improved oral glucose tolerance with an increase in insulin secretion. Although islet morphological analysis showed no obvious differences between hGPR40-Tg and nontransgenic (NonTg) mice, isolated islets from hGPR40-Tg mice enhanced insulin secretion in response to high glucose (16 mM) than those from NonTg mice with unchanged low glucose (3 mM)-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, hGPR40-Tg islets significantly increased insulin secretion against a naturally occurring agonist palmitate in the presence of 11 mM glucose. hGPR40-Tg mice were also found to be resistant to high fat diet-induced glucose intolerance, and hGPR40-Tg harboring KK mice showed augmented insulin secretion and improved oral glucose tolerance compared to nontransgenic littermates. Conclusions: Our results suggest that GPR40 may have a role in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and plasma glucose levels in vivo, and that pharmacological activation of GPR40 may provide a novel insulin secretagogue beneficial for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
