A recent study has shown that obese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who lose 10% of their body weight are more likely to achieve glycaemic and blood pressure targets, despite weight regain. A well-established non-surgical method for achieving weight loss >or=10% within 3 months is the use of very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs). In patients with diabetes, VLCDs are associated with rapid improvement in glycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors. The present review analyses the evidence from available trials on the effects of VLCDs on body weight, glycaemic control and complications, and their potential for clinical use in diabetes management.
