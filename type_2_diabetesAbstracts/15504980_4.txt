The expression of nephropathy in type 2 diabetes has several levels of abnormalities. To define the primary abnormalities of diabetic nephropathy, we conducted an autopsy study of 186 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes to determine correlations among the aldose reductase gene, renal histopathologies, extracellular matrix, glomerular function, and clinical characteristics. Compared with cases of near-normal renal structure (n = 51) and atypical diabetic glomerulopathy (n = 75), patients with classic diabetic glomerulopathy (n = 60) had advanced glomerular disease, as reflected by elevated plasma creatinine levels (133.2 +/- 59.8 vs. 166.0 +/- 65.7 vs. 243.8 +/- 82.6 micromol/l; P < 0.001), glomerular matrix fractions (20.8 +/- 6.7 vs. 33.5 +/- 16.8 vs. 39.2 +/- 14.3%; P < 0.001), and risk of renal failure (odds ratio [OR] 1 vs. 3.5 vs. 21.4; P < 0.001). Compared with noncarriers of the aldose reductase z-2 allele (n = 92) and z-2 heterozygotes (n = 77), z-2 homozygotes (n = 17) had elevated plasma creatinine (164.1 +/- 73.7 vs. 190.6 +/- 60.9 vs. 241.1 +/- 86.2 micromol/l; P < 0.001) and an increased risk of classic diabetic glomerulopathy (OR 1 vs. 0.9 vs. 3.3; P = 0.026). Overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta1, mesangial cell transdifferentiation by expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, and aberrant deposition of collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin were found in classic diabetic glomerulopathy. These data suggest genetic, biochemical, pathophysiological, and clinical correlations among the aldose reductase gene, extracellular matrix, classic diabetic glomerulopathy, and renal insufficiency. Gene mutation, cellular transdifferentiation, growth factor upregulation, extracellular matrix expansion, and glomerular filtration impairment are the primary abnormalities in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.
