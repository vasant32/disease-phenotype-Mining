 OBJECTIVE: The Diabetes Care Protocol combines task delegation (a practice nurse), computerized decision support, and feedback every 3 months. We studied the effect of the Diabetes Care Protocol on A1C and cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetic patients in primary care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cluster randomized trial, mean changes in cardiovascular risk factors between the intervention and control groups after 1 year were calculated by generalized linear models. RESULTS: Throughout the Netherlands, 26 intervention practices included 1,699 patients and 29 control practices 1,692 patients. The difference in A1C change was not significant, whereas total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and blood pressure improved significantly more in the intervention group. The 10-year coronary heart disease risk estimate of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study improved 1.4% more in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Delegation of routine diabetes care to a practice nurse combined with computerized decision support and feedback did not improve A1C but reduced cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes patients.
