 AIMS: Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a potent chemokine and plays an important role in cardiovascular diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between the genotypes of the MCP-1 A-2518G polymorphism and the development of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The subjects were 303 unrelated patients who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. To evaluate macroangiopathy, we measured carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) by ultrasonography. The MCP-1 A-2518G polymorphism was determined by TaqMan PCR method. RESULTS: IMT in patients with the MCP-1 -2518 AG or GG genotype was significantly greater than the AA-genotype (P=0.007). Simple regression analysis showed that age, systolic blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, the MCP-1 -2518 AG+GG polymorphism, and HbA1c level were correlated with IMT (P<0.0001, <0.0001, 0.006, 0.007, 0.025, respectively). In multiple regression analysis, the MCP-1 -2518 AG+GG polymorphism was the third strongest independent determinant of IMT in patients with type 2 diabetes (P=0.021), subsequent to age and systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Assessment of the MCP-1 A-2518G polymorphism would be useful in identifying the risk of developing carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.
