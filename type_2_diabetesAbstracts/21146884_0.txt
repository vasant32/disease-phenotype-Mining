Two hundred and eighty six subjects with cardiovascular diseases and 147 healthy newborns were studied. P53 codon 72 polymorphism was determined by DNA analysis. The association between BMI and diabetes depends on p53 polymorphism: Odds Ratio shows a high significant association between BMI and diabetes in *Arg/*Arg subjects (p=0.00001). No significant association is observed in *Pro allele carriers (p=0.203).
