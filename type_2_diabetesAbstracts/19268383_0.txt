 BACKGROUND: To compare the compliance and efficacy among three treatment modalities in patients of type 2 diabetes with fairly good islet function. METHODS: This 38-month open, randomized, prospective study enrolled 536 subjects (HbA1c 9.4+/-0.8%). Patients were divided into three groups including continual insulin injection (I), continual secretagogue administration (S) and alternation of two-month insulin injection and four-month secretagogue treatment (A). At baseline and every three months, HbA1c was measured and a standard bread meal test (100g) was performed. RESULTS: HbA1c were better controlled in both groups I and A than in S (6.9+/-0.3%, 6.8+/-0.3% vs. 7.6+/-0.5%). Hypoglycemia incidence was much lower in group A than that in I (0.8 times/patient/month vs. 2.4 times/patient/month) also with less weight gain (1.6 kg vs. 2.8 kg/patient/year). From the standard bread meal test, patients in group A got the greatest increment of 2-h C-peptide. Inquiry from all subjects showed that alternate strategy was welcomed by most of them considering for convenience and efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Alternate insulin-secretagogue treatment can effectively reduce HbA1c and help to improve islet function with reduced risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain under good compliance.
