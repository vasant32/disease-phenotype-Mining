 AIM: SWING was a prospective, observational study conducted in nine European countries primarily to assess direct treatment costs when switching from short-acting human insulins to rapid-acting insulin analogues (H-A) or vice versa (A-H) in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Data were collected at a baseline visit (time of switch) and at approximately 3, 6 and 12 months post-switch. RESULTS: In total, 2389 patients switched from H-A (n=2203) or A-H (n=186); another 603 were enrolled but ineligible. Mean (SD) direct diabetes-related costs (pro-rated to account for variable visit schedules) were €548.7 (865.8) 6 months prior to switch, €625.6 (1474.9) at 0-6 months and €568.6 (590.7) 6-12 months following switch for H-A, and €544.5 (421.0), €481.0 (301.5) and €461.6 (335.0) for A-H, respectively. Mean (SD) HbA(1c) decreased over 12 months by 1.08 (1.53)% units H-A and 1.17 (1.45)% units A-H. A small decline in hypoglycaemia occurred over time, but there were no clinically meaningful changes in mean PROs. CONCLUSIONS: There were small changes in mean direct diabetes-related costs (following adjustment for time interval) in patients switching in either direction. Improvements in mean HbA(1c) and incidence of hypoglycaemia cannot necessarily be attributed to therapeutic switch.
