In adipocytes, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are closely associated with metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these metabolic disorders have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this report, we demonstrate that overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in adipocytes stimulates oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, thus affecting the neighboring macrophages. Adipogenic G6PD overexpression promotes the expression of pro-oxidative enzymes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase, and the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling, which eventually leads to the dysregulation of adipocytokines and inflammatory signals. Furthermore, secretory factors from G6PD-overexpressing adipocytes stimulate macrophages to express more proinflammatory cytokines and to be recruited to the adipocytes; this would cause chronic inflammatory conditions in the adipose tissue of obesity. These effects of G6PD overexpression in adipocytes were abolished by pretreatment with NF-kappaB inhibitors or antioxidant drugs. Thus, we propose that a high level of G6PD in adipocytes may mediate the onset of metabolic disorders in obesity by increasing the oxidative stress and inflammatory signals.
