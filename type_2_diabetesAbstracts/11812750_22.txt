Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a potent glucose-lowering agent of potential interest for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. To evaluate actions of NN2211, a long-acting GLP-1 derivative, we examined 11 patients with type 2 diabetes, age 59 +/- 7 years (mean +/- SD), BMI 28.9 +/- 3.0 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) 6.5 +/- 0.6%, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. A single injection (10 microg/kg) of NN2211 was administered at 2300 h, and profiles of circulating insulin, C-peptide, glucose, and glucagon were monitored during the next 16.5 h. A standardized mixed meal was served at 1130 h. Efficacy analyses were performed for the fasting (7-8 h) and mealtime (1130-1530 h) periods. Insulin secretory rates (ISR) were estimated by C-peptide deconvolution analysis. Glucose pulse entrainment (6 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) every 10 min) was evaluated by 1-min sampled measurements of insulin concentrations from 0930 to 1030 h and subsequent time series analysis of the insulin concentration profiles. All results are given as NN2211 versus placebo; statistical analyses were performed by analysis of variance. In the fasting state, plasma glucose was significantly reduced (6.9 +/- 1.0 vs. 8.1 +/- 1.0 mmol/l; P = 0.004), ISR was increased (179 +/- 70 vs. 163 +/- 66 pmol/min; P = 0.03), and plasma glucagon was unaltered (19 +/- 4 vs. 20 +/- 4 pg/ml; P = 0.17) by NN2211. Meal-related area under the curve (AUC)(1130-1530 h) for glucose was markedly reduced (30.6 +/- 2.4 vs. 39.9 +/- 7.3 mmol x l(-1) x h(-1); P < 0.001), ISR AUC(1130-1530 h) was unchanged (118 +/- 32 vs. 106 +/- 27 nmol; P = 0.13), but the increment (relative to premeal values) was increased (65 +/- 22 vs. 45 +/- 11 nmol; P = 0.04). Glucagon AUC(1130-1530 h) was suppressed (77 +/- 18 vs. 82 +/- 17 pmol x l(-1) x h(-1); P = 0.04). Gastric emptying was significantly delayed as assessed by AUC(1130-1530 h) of 3-ortho-methylglucose (400 +/- 84 vs. 440 +/- 70 mg x l(-1) x h(-1); P = 0.02). During pulse entrainment, there was a tendency to increased high frequency regularity of insulin release as measured by a greater spectral power and autocorrelation coefficient (0.05 < P < 0.10). The pharmacokinetic profile of NN2211, as assessed by blood samplings for up to 63 h postdosing, was as follows: T(1/2) = 10.0 +/- 3.5 h and T(max) = 12.4 +/- 1.7 h. Two patients experienced gastrointestinal side effects on the day of active treatment. In conclusion, the long-acting GLP-1 derivative NN2211 effectively reduces fasting as well as meal-related (approximately 12 h postadministration) glycemia by modifying insulin secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and suppressing prandial glucagon secretion.
