The present study was undertaken to determine accumulation of risk factors in acute myocardial infarction during two periods of 2002 and 1990-1991. We collected 173 and 153 patients with acute myocardial infarction in 2002 and 1990-1991, respectively, and analyzed the history of multiple risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and obesity, and laboratory findings. The numbers and their percentages of all the risk factors increased in 2002 compared with 1990-1991. According to plasma glucose level, the patients who had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance had increased markedly from 41 to 65%. Multiple accumulation of risk factors had increased during the last one decade, and only one or no risk factor per se was not the case in the patients with acute myocardial infarction. Hyperlipidemia and hypertension became fairly controlled in the patients, but not hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus in the period of 2002. These findings may indicate that increased multiple accumulation of risk factors accelerates the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction in 2002 as compared to 1990-1991.
