Although hyperinsulinemia has attracted considerable attention as a possible risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), previous studies have not shown consistent results. Hyperglycemia could be an alternative explanation for the association between type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Since previous studies have been mostly lacking coronary angiographic data, we analyzed the relationship between the presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis based on angiography and hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia. Two hundred and thirty subjects underwent coronary angiography and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Age, sex, waist-to-hip ratio, postchallenge 1-h and 2-h glucose levels, plasma triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels were different between those with or without CAD. However, there was no significant difference in the plasma insulin levels, area of insulin under the curve, and the ratio of the insulin- and glucose areas between the groups with and without CAD. Multiple logistic regression analysis including fasting-, 1-h, and 2-h glucose values and a variety of atherosclerosis risk factors showed that age, sex and postchallenge 2-h glucose levels were independent determinants of the presence of CAD. These results suggest that coronary atherosclerosis might be associated with postchallenge hyperglycemia, but not with hyperinsulinemia in Korean subjects.
