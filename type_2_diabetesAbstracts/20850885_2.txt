We compared blood glucose profile when glargine or detemir was injected once daily before dinner in combination with pre-meal insulin lispro by a crossover design. Glargine showed lower post-dinner and bedtime glucose levels in Type 1 diabetes, and lower pre-dinner and post-dinner glucose levels in Type 2 diabetes than detemir.
