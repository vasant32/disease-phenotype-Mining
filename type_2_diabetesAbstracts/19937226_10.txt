 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Chromosome 1q21-q24 has been shown to be linked to type 2 diabetes. The International Type 2 Diabetes 1q Consortium showed that one of the nominal associations was located in the NOS1AP gene. Although this association was not replicated in additional samples of European descent, it remains unknown whether NOS1AP plays a role in Chinese individuals. METHODS: In stage 1 analyses, 79 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the NOS1AP gene were successfully genotyped in a group of Shanghai Chinese individuals, comprising 1,691 type 2 diabetes patients and 1,720 control participants. In stage 2 analyses, the SNP showing the strongest association was genotyped in additional Chinese individuals, including 1,663 type 2 diabetes patients and 1,408 control participants. RESULTS: In stage 1 analyses, 20 SNPs were nominally associated with type 2 diabetes (p < 0.05), with SNP rs12742393 showing the strongest association (OR 1.24 [95% CI 1.11-1.38]; p = 0.0002, empirical p = 0.019). Haplotype analysis also confirmed the association between rs12742393 and type 2 diabetes. In stage 2 analyses, the difference in allele frequency distribution of rs12742393 did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.254). However, the meta-analysis showed a significant association between rs12742393 and type 2 diabetes with an OR of 1.17 (95% CI 1.07-1.26; p = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that NOS1AP variants may not play a dominant role in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, but a minor effect cannot be excluded.
