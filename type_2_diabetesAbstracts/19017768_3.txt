 OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the potential for communication of familial risk by patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A questionnaire was completed by a random sample of patients with type 2 diabetes registered with a hospital diabetes clinic. RESULTS: Two-thirds of patients (65%) had spoken to at least one sibling or child about diabetes risk. They were more likely to believe their family was at risk, to worry about their family developing diabetes, and to be aware of the seriousness of diabetes. The results revealed greater awareness of family risk of type 2 diabetes compared with those from previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with type 2 diabetes had already taken the initiative, without formal prompting, to talk to family members about their risk of diabetes. Discussion of risk and interventions to reduce risk should be encouraged within families.
