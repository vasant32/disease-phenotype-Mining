 AIMS: We evaluated the use and annual cost of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) compared to conventional medicine in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Korean population. METHODS: We analyzed the database of 2752 DM patients obtained from the Korean National Diabetes Program (KNDP). The cost data of conventional medicine starting 1-year before enrolment of the KNDP were obtained from the hospital electronic database. The cost data of CAM over the same period were obtained from questionnaires. RESULTS: Among the 2752 subjects, 677 patients (24.6%) used CAM, with the most common type being red ginseng and herbal medicine. Patients with a higher income, neuropathy, and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) were more likely to use CAM. Men, those with a higher education level and income, no cerebrovascular accident (CVA) history, and SMBG showed a relatively higher cost of CAM of total medical cost. The independent predictors for CAM were a higher income, the existence of diabetic neuropathy, no CVA history, and SMBG. CONCLUSIONS: Use and cost of CAM varied depending on income, accompanying complications and SMBG. To evaluate the total medical costs in DM patients, a comprehensive approach considering not only conventional cost but also CAM is required.
