 OBJECTIVE: To test Web-based care management of glycemic control using a shared electronic medical record with patients who have type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a trial of 83 adults with type 2 diabetes randomized to receive usual care plus Web-based care management or usual care alone between August 2002 and May 2004. All patients had GHb > or =7.0%, had Web access from home, and could use a computer with English language-based programs. Intervention patients received 12 months of Web-based care management. The Web-based program included patient access to electronic medical records, secure e-mail with providers, feedback on blood glucose readings, an educational Web site, and an interactive online diary for entering information about exercise, diet, and medication. The primary outcome was change in GHb. RESULTS: GHb levels declined by 0.7% (95% CI 0.2-1.3) on average among intervention patients compared with usual-care patients. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol levels, and use of in-person health care services did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Care management delivered through secure patient Web communications improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.
