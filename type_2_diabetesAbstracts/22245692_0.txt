 AIM: To determine the independent effects of total and each health professional's frequency of contacts, on changes in anthropometric measures and physical capacity following a lifestyle intervention offered by a multi-disciplinary team in adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 12-month lifestyle intervention was performed in 48 adults with prediabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to either an individual counselling group (every six weeks)+an optional series of 25 group seminars (every week) or to the group seminars only. Physical activity level, energy intake, anthropometric measures, and physical capacity were assessed. RESULTS: Total frequency of contacts with any professional was associated with change in body weight, BMI and, waist circumference (all P â‰¤.05). However, no frequency of contacts with a specific professional was associated with the studied outcomes, except for changes in physical capacity. The latest was significantly improved in participants who attended at least two group sessions with the kinesiologist (P=.02). DISCUSSION: To improve anthropometric measures, total contact frequency seems to be more important than contact frequency with any specific professionals. However, to improve physical capacity, meeting with a kinesiologist for two or more occasions, in group sessions, seems to be an effective strategy.
