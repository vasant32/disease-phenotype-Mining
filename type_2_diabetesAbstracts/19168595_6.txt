 OBJECTIVE: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta (HNF1beta) is a transcription factor that is critical for pancreatic cell formation and glucose homeostasis. Previous studies have reported that common variants of HNF1beta were associated with type 2 diabetes in Caucasians and West Africans. However, analysis in the subjects from the Botnia study and Malm√∂ Preventive Project produced conflicting results, and the role for HNF1beta in type 2 diabetes susceptibility remains unclear. We therefore investigated common variants across the HNF1beta gene in a Chinese population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed for association with type 2 diabetes in subjects with type 2 diabetes (n = 1,859) and normal glucose regulation (n = 1,785). RESULTS: Consistent with the initial study, we observed evidence that the risk G allele of rs4430796 in intron 2 was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.16 [95% CI 1.05-1.29], P = 0.0035, empirical P = 0.0475). Furthermore, the at-risk G allele was associated with earlier age at diagnosis in the type 2 diabetic subjects (P = 0.0228). CONCLUSIONS: The result of this study provides evidence that variants in the HNF1beta region contribute to susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in the Chinese population.
