A 58-year-old woman was admitted at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes without keto-acidosis. Blood glucose was normalized initially with insulin. Whilst taking glibenclamide, she developed acute haemolysis. She was homozygous for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and had no other factors predisposing haemolysis. We reviewed the literature and discuss the relationship between glibenclamide and haemolytic crisis and between G6PD-deficiency and diabetes.
