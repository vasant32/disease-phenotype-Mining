AIM: To evaluate the antioxidant capacity and concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in aqueous humor from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with or without retinopathy. METHODS: Aqueous humor was obtained during elective cataract surgery from T2DM patients with or without retinopathy and from healthy subjects. Reducing response was evaluated by MTT dye reduction and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined by chemiluminescence assay. Granulocytes were treated with phorbol dibutyrate (PDB)-stimulated. Cytokines were quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: Antioxidant capacity of aqueous humor from patients with retinopathy was greater (P<0.05) than that of healthy controls or persons with diabetes without retinopathy. ROS production in PDB (protein kinase C activator)-stimulated granulocytes from T2DM patients with or without retinopathy was inhibited by autologous aqueous humor. Concentrations of VEGF and IL-6 were similar in aqueous humor from healthy controls and from patients without retinopathy, but lower (P<0.05) than those from T2DM patients with retinopathy. Plasma levels of VEGF and IL-6 were similar (P>0.05) in healthy controls and in T2DM patients with and without retinopathy. CONCLUSION: Aqueous humor from T2DM patients with retinopathy exhibits elevated antioxidant activity with significant suppressive effect on ROS production and enhanced levels of locally secreted VEGF and IL-6 in comparison with T2DM patients without retinopathy. These results suggest an inflammatory profile in the absence of typical oxidative stress for T2DM patients with retinopathy, possibly resulting from the compensatory antioxidant response detected in the aqueous humor improving the ocular redox state.
