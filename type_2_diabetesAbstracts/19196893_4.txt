 OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between obesity measures and albuminuria in adults with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) Study, BMI and waist circumference were measured among 4,985 participants while total percent body fat was measured by whole-body DEXA scans among 1,351 participants. Odds of albuminuria by quartiles of BMI, waist circumference, and percent total body fat were calculated using logistic regression analysis while adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: The highest quartile of BMI (odds ratio [OR] 1.72 [95% CI 1.40-2.11]) and waist circumference (OR 1.75 [95% CI 1.42-2.15]) was significantly associated with albuminuria compared with the lowest quartile after adjustment for covariates. No associations were noted between quartiles of percent total body fat and albuminuria in any model. CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI and abdominal obesity are associated with albuminuria in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes.
