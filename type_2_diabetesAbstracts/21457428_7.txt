Canagliflozin, a potent, selective sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes, lowers plasma glucose (PG) by lowering the renal threshold for glucose (RT(G) ) and increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). An ascending single oral-dose phase 1 study investigated safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of canagliflozin in healthy men (N = 63) randomized to receive canagliflozin (n = 48) or placebo (n = 15). Canagliflozin (10, 30, 100, 200, 400, 600 or 800 mg q.d. or 400 mg b.i.d.) was administered to eight cohorts (six subjects/cohort: canagliflozin; two subjects/cohort: placebo). Dose dependently, canagliflozin decreased calculated 24-h mean RT(G) with maximal reduction to approximately 60 mg/dl, and increased mean 24-h UGE. At doses >200 mg administered before breakfast, canagliflozin reduced postprandial PG and serum insulin excursions at that meal. Canagliflozin was generally well tolerated; most adverse events were mild and no hypoglycaemia was reported. These results support further study of canagliflozin.
