 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of sympathetic versus parasympathetic neuropathy among type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 43 patients with type 1 and 17 with type 2 diabetes who were investigated. Sympathetic nerve function was assessed by measurement of the vasoconstriction (VAC) index by laser Doppler perfusion imaging of a locally heated finger followed by indirect cooling. Parasympathetic nerve function was assessed by R-R interval variation during deep breathing as measured by the expiration/inspiration (E/I) ratio. Results were expressed as age-corrected z scores in SD; VAC index >1.64 SD and E/I ratio <-1.64 SD were considered abnormal. RESULTS: VAC index was abnormal in 40% with type 1 and 41% with type 2 diabetes, whereas the E/I ratio was abnormal in 42% with type 1 and 65% with type 2 diabetes. There was a clear association between VAC index and E/I ratio among type 1 (rs=0.525; P=0.0002) but not among type 2 (rs=0.10) diabetic patients. Among type 2 diabetic patients, the degree of dysfunction was most severe regarding parasympathetic function (P=0.0167). CONCLUSIONS: Sympathetic and parasympathetic neuropathy were frequent in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. However, there was a difference between the two types of diabetes. Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve functions correlated in type 1 but not in type 2 diabetic patients. The explanation for this discrepancy might be that parasympathetic nerve function was most severely affected among type 2 diabetic patients.
