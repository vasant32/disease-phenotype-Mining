We report on three type 2 diabetic patients whose daily basal insulin dose requirements were substantially reduced after switching from insulin detemir to insulin glargine. Meta-analysis of three randomised trials of basal insulin initiation confirmed this increased insulin detemir dose requirement in type 2 patients. Potential explanations are discussed.
