Adiponectin is a circulating protein secreted by adipocytes and is thought to have insulin-sensitizing effects. We present genetic analysis of adiponectin levels in 517 Pima Indians without diabetes (from 162 families, 750 sib-pairs). Adiponectin concentrations were heritable, with 39% of the variance of age- and sex-adjusted adiponectin potentially accounted for by additive genetic influences in this population. In genome-wide linkage analyses, suggestive linkage (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 3.0) of adiponectin adjusted for age and sex was found on chromosome 9p at 18 cM. Linkage was also present after inclusion of adiponectin concentrations of siblings with type 2 diabetes not treated pharmacologically (total siblings 582, 182 families, 860 sib-pairs: LOD = 3.5). Tentative evidence of linkage was also found on chromosomes 2 (LOD = 1.7 at 89 cM), 3 (LOD = 1.9 at 124 cM), and 10 (LOD = 1.7 at 70 cM), offering some support to findings of a previous genome-wide scan of adiponectin. Our data suggest that quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 2, 3, 9, and 10 may influence circulating adiponectin concentrations in the Pima population.
