 AIMS: The study examined awareness and understanding of the bidirectional relationship between type 2 diabetes and oral health care in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Focus groups were held with 30 participants with type 2 diabetes. Groups were comprised of African Americans (n=16), Hispanics (n=6), and Caucasians (n=8). A grounded theory approach was used to analyse and interpret findings. RESULTS: Participants were unaware of the relationship between type 2 diabetes and oral health but were concerned about the influence of poor oral health on quality of life. Having diabetes was reported as a potential challenge for the coordination and receipt of dental care. Patient-provider communication of diabetes and oral health needs were perceived to be inadequate. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes are at-risk for poor oral health, yet have limited awareness and understanding of the specific oral health care needs and risks associated with type 2 diabetes. This lack of awareness and understanding of the relationship between diabetes and oral health may be an indicator of inadequate oral health literacy. Addressing the relationship between diabetes and oral health with patients may improve dental outcomes, increase quality of life, and promote oral health literacy in at-risk populations.
