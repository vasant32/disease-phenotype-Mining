 OBJECTIVE: Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular calcification and a mediator of insulin resistance. This study evaluated the association of plasma fetuin-A and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 738 individuals with type 2 diabetes (mean age 58.7 years, 37.1% female) without known cardiovascular or kidney disease were included in this cross-sectional analysis. RESULTS: Subjects with PAD had a significantly lower fetuin-A (264.3 vs. 293.4 ng/dl, P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, a 1-SD decrease in fetuin-A increased the odds of PAD (odds ratio 1.6, P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis revealed an increased odds even in subjects with glomerular filtration rate >80 (odds ratio 1.9, P = 0.05) or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein <3 mg/dl (odds ratio 2.7, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Lower circulating fetuin-A is associated with PAD in type 2 diabetes beyond traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Our findings suggest a potentially unique role for fetuin-A deficiency as a biomarker of PAD in patients with type 2 diabetes.
