OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of repaglinide compared with placebo in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a phase II multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-adjustment and maintenance trial. After screening and a 2-week washout period, 99 patients were randomized to receive either repaglinide (n = 66) or placebo (n = 33). Patients underwent 6 weeks of dose adjustment followed by 12 weeks of dose maintenance. Fasting and stimulated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were measured at predetermined intervals. Adverse events and hypoglycemic episodes were recorded. RESULTS: From baseline to last visit, mean HbA1c decreased from 8.5 to 7.8% in patients treated with repaglinide and increased from 8.1 to 9.3% in patients receiving placebo, with a statistically significant difference of - 1.7% (P < 0.0001) between treatment groups at the last visit. Mean fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose increased in patients receiving placebo and decreased in patients treated with repaglinide, with statistically significant (P < 0.01) differences between groups at the last visit. Concentrations of fasting and postprandial insulin and C-peptide were lower at the last visit compared with baseline for patients treated with placebo and higher for patients treated with repaglinide, and the differences between groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Overall, repaglinide was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that repaglinide was safe and efficacious in lowering blood glucose concentrations. In addition to overall improvement in glycemic control noted with repaglinide in both sulfonylurea-treated patients and oral hypoglycemic agent-naive patients, repaglinide had a potent glucose-lowering effect in the postprandial period.
