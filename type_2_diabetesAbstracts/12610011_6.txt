 OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether quantity or quality of dietary fat predicts coronary heart disease (CHD) events in middle-aged type 2 diabetic subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The dietary habits of 366 type 2 diabetic men and 295 women, aged 45-64 years and free from CHD, were assessed with a 53-item food frequency questionnaire. They were followed up for 7 years. RESULTS: Men in the highest tertile of the polyunsaturated/saturated fat (P/S) ratio (>0.28) had a significantly lower risk for CHD death than men in the two lowest tertiles (5.0 vs. 14.2%, P = 0.009). The risk for all CHD events was 14.2 vs. 23.2%, respectively (P = 0.044). P/S ratio did not predict CHD events in women. In Cox multiple regression analyses taking into account other cardiovascular risk factors, the highest P/S ratio tertile was associated with the lowest rate of CHD death in men (P = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Low P/S ratio in men predicted future CHD events in type 2 diabetic subjects independently of conventional CHD risk factors.
