We investigated the influence of the reciprocal association between serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) on the risk of brain infarction in type 2 diabetic patients. One hundred seventy nine middle-aged and elderly diabetic patients without histories of cardiovascular events were followed up for an average of 8 years. Fourteen patients developed symptomatic brain infarction (BI) during follow-up. These patients had significantly higher blood pressure, longer duration of diabetes, silent brain infarction, microvascular complications such as macroalbuminuria, and higher creatinine, sICAM-1 and hs-CRP levels at baseline as compared with those without BI. A high risk of stroke was observed in patients with high levels of sICAM-1 (>260microg/L) and hs-CRP (>0.83mg/L) at baseline, respectively, and patients with high levels of both were more likely to develop BI. In addition, sICAM-1 levels were significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure and glycemic control index, whereas hs-CRP levels were correlated with fasting insulin levels, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. Consequently, sICAM-1 and hs-CRP levels were, respectively, reflected in different cardiovascular risk factors. This study suggests that both measurements of hs-CRP and sICAM-1 levels are useful as a predictor of future stroke in diabetic subjects.
