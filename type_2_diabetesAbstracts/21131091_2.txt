 AIMS: To investigate the association of solute carrier family 30 member 8 (SLC30A8) rs13266634 C/T polymorphism with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and type 1 diabetes (T1DM). METHODS: We searched all the publications about the association between SLC30A8 and diabetes from PubMed, and evaluated the association between SLC30A8 rs13266634 C/T polymorphism and T2DM, IGT and T1DM, respectively, by meta-analysis of all the validated studies. Allelic and genotypic comparisons between cases and controls were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty six studies were included in the meta-analysis: 31 studies were analysed for rs13266634 C/T polymorphism with T2DM, 3 studies with IGT and 4 studies with T1DM. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) for allelic and genotypic comparisons (including additive model, co-dominant model, dominant model and recessive model) showed that rs13266634 C/T polymorphism was significantly associated with increased T2DM risk: OR=1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.13-1.17, P<0.001, P(heterogeneity)=0.041, OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.26-1.41, P<0.001, P(heterogeneity)=0.908, OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.16-1.24, P<0.001, P(heterogeneity)=0.699, and OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.17-1.30, P<0.001, P(heterogeneity)=0.801, respectively. In subgroup analyses, we found that rs13266634 C/T polymorphism was associated with T2DM risk both in Asian and European subgroup (P<0.001), but not in African (P>0.05). And the pooled odds ratio (OR) for allelic frequency comparison showed that rs13266634 C/T polymorphism was also significantly associated with IGT: OR=1.15, 95% CI=1.06-1.26, P<0.001, P(heterogeneity)=0.364. Meanwhile, our meta-analysis did not suggest that rs13266634 C/T polymorphism was associated with T1DM risk (P>0.05): OR=1.02, 95% CI=0.98-1.06, P=0.328, P(heterogeneity)=0.488 for allelic frequency comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis results revealed the significant association between rs13266634 C/T polymorphism and T2DM and IGT, but did not support the association between this polymorphism and T1DM.
