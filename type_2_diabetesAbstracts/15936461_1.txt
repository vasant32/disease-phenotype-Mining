AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether the influence of insulin therapy on fasting and stimulated C-peptide levels in type 2 diabetic subjects is due to plasma glucose reduction or a direct effect of exogenous insulin. METHODS: Plasma glucose and serum C-peptide levels were determined before and after IV injection of 1mg glucagon on three separate days in 21 type 2 diabetic subjects. Day 1: without pharmacological treatment and fasting plasma glucose > 11.1 mmol/L; day 2: fasting plasma glucose 4.4-7.8 mmol/L, 1h after withdrawing intravenous regular insulin infusion; day 3: fasting plasma glucose 4.4-7.8 mmol/L with bed-time NPH insulin. RESULTS: Fasting and glucagon stimulated C-peptide levels were higher on day 1 than days 2 and 3. Fasting, but not stimulated C-peptide levels, were lower on day 3 than day 2. These differences were not appeared when the percentage of C-peptide increment or the C-peptide/glucose ratio were compared in the three days. CONCLUSIONS: Blood glucose reduction instead of exogenous insulin is responsible for the C-peptide decrease during insulin therapy in type 2 diabetic subjects.
