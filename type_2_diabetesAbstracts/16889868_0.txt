 OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of diabetic patients that achieved glycemic control (HbA1c pound7.0%) and to explore some of the barriers to achieve this control. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational study. SETTING: Health centres in North and Central Trinidad. PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty-two type 2 diabetics attending the health centres for more than 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HbA1c levels and the proportion of patients who achieve glycemic control, HbA1c pound7.0%. RESULTS: The patients were categorized into two groups: well controlled, HbA1c Y7.0% and poorly controlled, HbA1c>7.0%. The majority of patients were poorly controlled (55.3%), duration of diabetes impacted negatively older patients and patients attending the clinics for longer periods were less likely to be well controlled. There was no correlation between pharmacological treatment, availability of individual counselling by a dietician or regular monitoring of blood glucose and glycemic control (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: A 44.7% of patients with type 2 diabetes were found to be well controlled. Old age (51-70 years) and lengthy periods of attendance seem to be barriers to achieving glycemic control. This study highlights the fact that there is a need for re-evaluation of the diabetic program since despite changes in the primary care system over the past 5 years a large proportion of diabetics are still uncontrolled.
