 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Additional susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes have been identified by a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in European populations. To examine further the roles of these new loci, we performed a replication study for the association of these single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci with the disease in three independent Japanese populations. METHODS: We genotyped seven of the 11 SNPs that emerged in stage 2 of the meta-analysis for European GWASs (rs864745 in JAZF1, rs12779790 near CDC123/CAMK1D, rs7961581 near TSPAN8/LGR5, rs4607103 near ADAMTS9, rs10923931 in NOTCH2, rs1153188 near DCD and rs9472138 near VEGFA) for three independent Japanese populations (first set, 1,630 type 2 diabetes patients vs 1,064 controls; second set, 1,272 type 2 diabetes patients vs 856 controls; third set, 486 type 2 diabetes patients vs 936 controls) using a TaqMan assay. The association of the SNP loci in each population was analysed using a logistic regression analysis, adjusting for age, sex and BMI, and the data were evaluated by a meta-analysis. RESULTS: A meta-analysis for the three case-control studies identified a nominal association of rs864745 in JAZF1 with type 2 diabetes (OR 1.148, 95% CI 1.034-1.275, p = 0.0098, corrected p = 0.069). The association of other loci did not reach statistically significant levels (nominal p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: From these results the contribution of these seven loci in conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is considered minor in the Japanese population, if they are present.
