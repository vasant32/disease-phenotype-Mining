Structured diabetes teaching and treatment programmes (STTP) are increasingly offered for patients with diabetes to improve metabolic control. We prospectively studied the long term-effect of STTP on metabolic control and knowledge of diabetes in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, differences in the mode of follow-up by a university diabetes centre (UDC) versus general practitioner (GP) were assessed. Of the 64 patients with type 2 diabetes (61 +/- 10 years old, diabetes duration 11 +/- 7 years) included in the study 52 could be reevaluated after 2 years. Of those, 31 were followed up by the UDC and 21 by their GPs who received detailed follow-up instructions from the UDC. In all patients, HbA1c decreased from 9.1 +/- 0.3% before the programme to 8.3 +/- 0.3% 2 years after the programme (P = 0.004), whereas body mass index increased from 28.8 +/- 0.8 to 30.3 +/- 0.9 kg/m2 (P < 0.001). Patients had a significantly better knowledge of diabetes and diet 2 years after the programme. For all parameters tested, none of the changes differed between patients managed by the UDC versus those managed by their GP. However, patients who chose follow-up by the UDC were more obese and had a better knowledge of diabetes. In conclusion, the STTP for patients with type 2 diabetes was effective in improving the long-term glycaemic control and knowledge of diabetes. Moreover, with precise therapeutic goals and follow-up instructions given to patient and GP this improvement was independent of the mode of outpatient follow-up.
