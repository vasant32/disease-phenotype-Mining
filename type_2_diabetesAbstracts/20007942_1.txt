OBJECTIVE Insulin resistance is greater in racial/ethnic minorities than in non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) for those with and without type 2 diabetes. Because previous research on insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes was limited to NHWs, racial/ethnic variation in an estimated measure of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes was determined. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The sample included 79 individuals with type 1 diabetes diagnosed at age <18 years (32.9% NHWs, 46.8% non-Hispanic black [NHB], 7.6% other/mixed, and 12.7% Hispanic) and their families. Estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) (milligrams per kilogram per minute; a lower eGDR indicates greater insulin resistance) was calculated using A1C, waist circumference, and hypertension status. RESULTS Mean current age was 13.5 years (range 3.2-32.5) and diabetes duration was 5.7 years (0.1-19.9). eGDR was inversely associated with age. Compared with that in NHWs, age-adjusted eGDR was significantly lower among nonwhites (NHB, other/mixed, and Hispanic: Delta = -1.83, P = 0.0006). Age-adjusted eGDR was negatively associated with body fat, triglycerides, urinary albumin/creatinine, acanthosis nigricans, parental obesity, and parental insulin resistance and positively related to HDL and sex hormone-binding globulin. In multivariable analysis, lower eGDR was significantly associated with older age, nonwhite race/ethnicity, acanthosis, and lower HDL. CONCLUSIONS Minorities with type 1 diabetes are significantly more insulin resistant, as measured by eGDR, than NHWs. Exploring potential mechanisms, including disparities in care and/or physiological variation, may contribute to preventing racial/ethnic differences in insulin resistance-associated outcomes.
