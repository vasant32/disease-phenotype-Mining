The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARgamma2) Pro12Ala polymorphism has been associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes and a lower albumin excretion rate (AER) in patients with established diabetes. We performed a case-control study aiming to evaluate the association between the Pro12Ala polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy. Genomic DNA was obtained from 104 type 2 diabetic patients (case subjects) with chronic renal insufficiency (78 on dialysis and 26 with proteinuria [AER >or=200 microg/min] and serum creatinine >or=2.0 mg/dl) and 212 normoalbuminuric patients (AER <20 microg/min) with known diabetes duration >or=10 years (control subjects). The genotypic distribution of the PPARgamma2 Pro12Ala polymorphism in these diabetic patients was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and the Ala allele frequency was 9%. The frequency of Ala carriers (Ala/Ala or Ala/Pro) was 20.3% in control subjects and 10.6% in case subjects (P = 0.031). The odds ratio of having diabetic nephropathy for Ala carriers was 0.465 (95% CI 0.229-0.945; P = 0.034). Carriers of the Ala allele were not different from noncarriers (Pro/Pro) regarding sex (38.9 vs. 44.1% males) or ethnicity (77.4 vs. 71.7% white) distribution, age (61 +/- 10 vs. 61 +/- 10 years), known diabetes duration (17 +/- 7 vs. 16 +/- 7 years), BMI (27 +/- 4 vs. 28 +/- 5 kg/m(2)), fasting plasma glucose (184 +/- 81 vs. 176 +/- 72 mg/dl), HbA(1c) (6.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.9 +/- 2.4%; high-performance liquid chromatography reference range: 2.7-4.3%), and systolic (145 +/- 27 vs. 0.144 +/- 24 mmHg) or diastolic (87 +/- 14 vs. 85 +/- 14 mmHg) blood pressure, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of the Ala allele may confer protection from diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
