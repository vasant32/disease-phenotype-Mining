AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: In humans, one of the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes is a reduced plasma concentration of HDL and its major protein component, apolipoprotein A-I (APOA-I). However, it is unknown whether APOA-I directly protects against diabetes. The aim of this study was to characterise the functional role of APOA-I in glucose homeostasis. METHODS: The effects of APOA-I on phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), glucose uptake and endocytosis were analysed in C2C12 myocytes. Glucose metabolism was investigated in Apoa-I knockout (Apoa-I (-/-)) mice. RESULTS: APOA-I was able to stimulate the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, and elevated glucose uptake in C2C12 myocytes. APOA-I could be endocytosed into C2C12 myotubes through a clathrin-dependent endocytotic process. Inhibition of endocytosis abrogated APOA-I-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation. In Apoa-I (-/-) mice, AMPK phosphorylation was reduced in skeletal muscle and liver, and expression of gluconeogenic enzymes was increased in liver. In addition, the Apoa-I (-/-) mice had increased fat content and compromised glucose tolerance. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data indicate that APOA-I has a protective effect against diabetes via activation of AMPK. ApoA-I deletion in the mouse led to increased fat mass and impaired glucose tolerance.
