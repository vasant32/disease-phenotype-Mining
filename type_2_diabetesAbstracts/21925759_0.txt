We examined a possible association between subclinical hypothyroidism and albuminuria in 159 people with type 2 diabetes. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism had significantly higher levels of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) than those with euthyroidism. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that serum TSH level was an independent risk factor of albuminuria.
