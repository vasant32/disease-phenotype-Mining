The hypothalamus is critically involved in the regulation of feeding. Previous studies have shown that glucose ingestion inhibits hypothalamic neuronal activity. However, this was not observed in patients with type 2 diabetes. Restoring energy balance by reducing caloric intake and losing weight are important therapeutic strategies in patients with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that caloric restriction would have beneficial effects on the hypothalamic neuronal response to glucose ingestion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 10 male type 2 diabetic patients before and after a 4-day very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) at a 3.0 Tesla scanner using a blood oxygen level-dependent technique for measuring neuronal activity in the hypothalamus in response to an oral glucose load. Hypothalamic signals were normalized to baseline value, and differences between the pre- and postdiet condition were tested using paired t tests. Pre-VLCD scans showed no response of the hypothalamus to glucose intake (i.e., no signal decrease after glucose intake was observed). Post-VLCD scans showed a prolonged signal decrease after glucose ingestion. The results of the current study demonstrate that short-term caloric restriction readily normalizes hypothalamic responsiveness to glucose ingestion in patients with type 2 diabetes.
