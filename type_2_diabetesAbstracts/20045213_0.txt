 BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects of Glimepiride on blood glucose in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in connection with plasma lipoproteins and plasminogen activity. METHODS: A total of 565 T2DM patients were received Glimepiride (n=333) or Glibenclamide (n=232) for 12 weeks. We observed the level of blood glucose (BG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), the insulin resistance (IR) state, plasma lipoproteins, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) before and after a 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: After 12 weeks with Glimepiride treatment, significant reductions were observed in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 2-h postprandial BG(PBG), HbA1C (from 8.60+/-3.10 to 7.10+/-1.60%) and HOMA-IR (from 4.11+/-0.85 to 2.42+/-0.91%). The level of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly decreased, whereas that of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was increased markedly with statistical significance. In addition, there was an obvious improvement in t-PA activity (from 0.225+/-0.11 to 0.457+/-0.177IU/ml); whereas the PAI-1 activity was decreased significantly (from 0.898+/-0.168 to 0.533+/-0.215AU/ml). No significant changes were observed in plasma lipoprotein profiles and plasminogen activity in Glibenclamide receiving group. CONCLUSIONS: Glimepiride can rapidly and stably improve glycemic control and lipoprotein metabolism, significantly alleviate insulin resistance and enhance fibrinolytic activity.
