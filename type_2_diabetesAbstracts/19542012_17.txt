 OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether a whey preload could slow gastric emptying, stimulate incretin hormones, and attenuate postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eight type 2 diabetic patients ingested 350 ml beef soup 30 min before a potato meal; 55 g whey was added to either the soup (whey preload) or potato (whey in meal) or no whey was given. RESULTS: Gastric emptying was slowest after the whey preload (P < 0.0005). The incremental area under the blood glucose curve was less after the whey preload and whey in meal than after no whey (P < 0.005). Plasma glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, insulin, and cholecystokinin concentrations were higher on both whey days than after no whey, whereas glucagon-like peptide 1 was greatest after the whey preload (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Whey protein consumed before a carbohydrate meal can stimulate insulin and incretin hormone secretion and slow gastric emptying, leading to marked reduction in postprandial glycemia in type 2 diabetes.
