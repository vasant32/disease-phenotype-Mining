AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Raised N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is associated with a poor cardiac outcome in non-diabetic populations. Elevated NT-proBNP predicts excess morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients with an elevated urinary albumin excretion rate. This study investigated the prognostic value of NT-proBNP in a cohort of type 2 diabetic patients. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective observational follow-up study, 315 type 2 diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria (n=188), microalbuminuria (n=80) and macroalbuminuria (n=47) at baseline were followed for a median (range) of 15.5 (0.2-17.0) years. Plasma NT-proBNP concentrations were determined by immunoassay at baseline. Endpoints were overall and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Of the patients, 162 died (51%), 119 of them (74%) due to cardiovascular causes. All-cause mortality was increased in patients with NT-proBNP in the second and third tertiles (hazard ratios [95% CI] compared with the first tertile, 1.70 [1.08-2.67] and 5.19 [3.43-7.88], p<0.001). These associations persisted after adjustment for urinary albumin excretion rate, glomerular filtration rate and conventional cardiovascular risk factors (covariate adjusted hazard ratios 1.46 [0.91-2.33] and 2.54 [1.56-4.14], p<0.001). This increased mortality was attributable to more cardiovascular deaths in the second and third NT-proBNP tertile (unadjusted hazard ratios 1.63 [0.96-2.77] and 4.88 [3.01-7.91], p<0.001; covariate adjusted 1.37 [0.79-2.37] and 2.26 [1.27-4.02], p=0.01). When patients with normo-, micro- and macroalbuminuria were analysed separately, NT-proBNP levels above the median (62 ng/l) were consistently associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality in all three groups (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated circulating NT-proBNP is a strong predictor of the excess overall and cardiovascular mortality, this predictor status being independent of urinary albumin excretion rate and conventional cardiovascular risk factors.
