 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To determine whether serum uric acid: (1) is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) death and/or all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes; and (2) consistent with published data, predicts these outcomes in older patients and those of southern European ethnicity. METHODS: We studied those 1,268 (98%) of 1,294 type 2 participants in the observational Fremantle Diabetes Study who had a fasting serum uric acid measured at baseline. Mortality data were collected over a mean (+/-SD) 10.3 +/- 3.9 years. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to determine independent baseline predictors of CVD and all-cause death including fasting serum uric acid as a continuous variable and quartiles. RESULTS: During follow up, 525 deaths occurred (41.4% of the cohort) of which 271 (51.6%) were attributed to CVD. In univariate analyses, patients in the highest uric acid quartile had the greatest CVD and all-cause mortality (p = 0.007 and p = 0.001). After adjustment for significant variables in the most parsimonious model, baseline serum uric acid was not an independent associate of CVD or all-cause mortality whether entered as a continuous variable (HR 1.11 [95% CI 0.96-1.27] and 1.10 [95% CI 0.98-1.22] for a 0.1 mmol/l increase, respectively) or as quartiles (p > 0.10). Analyses of 638 patients >65 years of age and 231 of southern European ethnicity produced similar results. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Serum uric acid was not an independent predictor of CVD or all-cause mortality in our community-based type 2 patients. Fasting serum uric acid concentrations do not appear to be prognostically useful in type 2 diabetes.
