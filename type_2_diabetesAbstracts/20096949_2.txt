Circulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels may correlate with diabetic complications. Whether they are changed in early diabetic cardiomyopathy is not known and was examined in this study. TIMP-1 and collagen degradation products were also measured. Results from subjects with and without diastolic dysfunction were compared with those obtained for patients with varying stages of diabetic renal disease. Patients with type 2 diabetes with or without diastolic dysfunction with varying degrees of renal disease were recruited for this study. Age-matched non-diabetic subjects served as controls. MMPs (-1, -3 and -7) and TIMP-1 were measured by ELISA, MMP-2 and -9 by zymography and collagen degradation products by radioimmunoassay. Differences in the pattern of MMPs/TIMPs and collagen degradation products were observed. The most consistent change was in totalMMP-7, which was increased in those with diastolic dysfunction and those with macroalbuminuria. MMP-7 correlated with cardiac function (p<0.05 vs control, in those with diastolic dysfunction), and renal filtration function (p<0.05 vs control). In summary, we have identified novel relationships between serum MMP-7 and diabetic complications specifically in renal disease and in diastolic dysfunction. How increased circulating MMP-7 is associated with these diabetic microvascular complications and the significance of these findings will require prospective studies.
