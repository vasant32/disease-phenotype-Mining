 BACKGROUND: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women improves menopausal symptoms, decreases the incidence of osteoporotic fracture, but the effects on cardiovascular risk factors remain controversial. AIM: To test the hypothesis that HRT may have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular risk profile in postmenopausal women with diabetes. METHODS: One hundred and fifty postmenopausal patients with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) were randomized to receive HRT (Kliofem) or placebo for 12 months. We monitored the effects on cardiovascular risk factors, including lipid profile, glycaemic control, blood pressure and body weight. RESULTS: Mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was associated with a nonsignificant decrease [-0.14 mmol/l (CI=-0.44, 0.17) (p=0.37)] in the Kliofem-treated group. Total cholesterol fell by 0.42 mmol/l (CI=-0.78, -0.05) (p=0.027). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was reduced by a mean of 0.07 mmol/l compared to a mean rise of 0.12 mmol/l on placebo. There were apparent differences in the treatment effects between T1DM and T2DM. There was no change in triglycerides or apoprotein B and no effect on glycaemic control, blood pressure or menopausal symptom scores. In the Kliofem group, BMI fell by 0.66 kg/m2 compared to an increase of 0.14 kg/m2 for placebo patients (p=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Although the long-term effects of HRT in women with or without diabetes appear to suggest that some types of HRT either confer no cardiovascular protection or may increase risk, the impact of Kliofem diabetic women on cardiovascular risk factors is probably neutral.
