Recent attention has been drawn to the close association between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Debate has included much discussion about cause and effect with mechanisms proposed whereby one condition might cause the other. However, both clearly share a common phenotype, namely, obesity that overlaps considerably with the other components of the metabolic syndrome, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. It would therefore appear likely that all are manifestations of the same basic pathological processes. Possible interacting aetiological mechanisms are reviewed along with treatment options. A recent report by the International Diabetes Federation has made recommendations to raise awareness of possible OSA in patients with T2DM and also for screening for hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and T2DM in patients with known OSA. The clinical implications are discussed.
