AIMS: This observational study aimed to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of adding insulin glargine (LANTUS((R))) to support oral antidiabetic (OAD) treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes in everyday practice. METHODS: A 9-month, open-label, multicentre, observational study, with an optional 20-month extension phase, in which add-on insulin glargine therapy was initiated in 12,216 patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on OADs. The insulin glargine dose was adjusted at the physician's discretion, reflecting everyday practice. The main outcome measures were changes in HbA(1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin dose and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: At baseline, mean (+/- s.d.) age was 63.9 +/- 11.3 years; disease duration was >5 years in 47% of patients, 1-5 years in 39% of patients and <1 year in 10% of patients, while 4% of patients were newly diagnosed. Addition of insulin glargine to OAD therapy led to reductions in mean HbA(1c) (-1.5% from 8.7%) and FBG (-69 mg/dl from 202 mg/dl) levels after 3 months, which were maintained after 9 months [HbA(1c): -1.7%; FBG: -71 mg/dl (-3.9 mmol/l)] without an increase in BMI. Similar glycaemic control was observed after 20 months in the 2721 patients in the extension study. Adverse drug reactions were documented in 26 patients (0.2%). Of 47 adverse events documented, 19 were due to hypoglycaemia. CONCLUSIONS: In everyday practice, patients with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled on OADs benefit from add-on basal insulin treatment with insulin glargine as they demonstrate improved glycaemic control without weight gain.
