We investigated the hypothesis that modified lipoproteins trigger an immune response leading to the production of autoantibodies and subsequently to the formation of atherogenic immune complexes (IC). We recruited 20 type 2 diabetic patients with macrovascular disease, 14 nondiabetic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and 34 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex, and race. Serum antibodies to oxidized and glycated LDL did not differ significantly among the 3 groups. Serum IC contained variable, but not statistically different, amounts of IgG, IgM, and IgA. In contrast, the content of cholesterol in IC isolated from diabetic patients was significantly higher than that in IC isolated from control subjects, and the content of apolipoprotein (apo)-B was significantly higher than that in IC isolated from control subjects and patients with CAD. Cholesteryl ester accumulation in human monocyte-derived macrophages incubated with IC, a measure of the atherogenic potential of IC, was significantly higher in macrophages incubated with red blood cell-adsorbed IC isolated from diabetic patients compared with IC isolated from control subjects (P < 0.03) or from patients with CAD (P < 0.04) and was strongly correlated with the content of apoB (r = 0.68, P < 0.001) and cholesterol (r = 0.61, P < 0.001) in IC. LDL from diabetic patients was more susceptible to oxidation in vitro, was significantly smaller, and contained significantly less alpha-tocopherol than LDL isolated from subjects in the other groups. In addition, the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid content of phospholipids and cholesteryl esters in LDL isolated from diabetic patients was significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared with that from patients with CAD or from control subjects. We postulate that LDL size, susceptibility to oxidation, and lipid fatty acid composition may play a critical role in the production of antibodies to oxidized LDL and consequently in the formation of LDL-containing IC in patients with type 2 diabetes.
