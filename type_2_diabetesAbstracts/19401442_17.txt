OBJECTIVE We study the effectiveness of the GOAL Lifestyle Implementation Trial at the 36-month follow-up. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants (n = 352, type 2 diabetes risk score FINDRISC = 16.2 +/- 3.3, BMI 32.6 +/- 5.0 kg/m(2)) received six lifestyle counseling sessions over 8 months. Measurements were at baseline, 12 months (88.6%), and 36 months (77.0%). RESULTS Statistically significant risk reduction at 12 months was maintained at 36 months in weight (-1.0 +/- 5.6 kg), BMI (-0.5 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2)), and serum total cholesterol (-0.4 +/- 1.1 mmol/l). CONCLUSIONS Maintenance of risk reduction in this "real world" trial proves the intervention's potential for significant public health impact.
