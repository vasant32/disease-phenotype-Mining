Although diabetes mellitus is becoming prevalent in Iran, no comprehensive data on diabetes-related complications exist. A systematic search of English and Farsi databases identified 26 publications on the prevalence of macro- and microvascular complications in adult Iranians with type 2 diabetes. Micro- and macroalbuminuria, retinopathy and neuropathy were highly prevalent and cardiovascular complications were prevalent. Valid studies on diabetic foot ulcers and lower limb amputations were few. Insufficient evidence of late complications precluded data extrapolation to the whole Iranian diabetic population. However, considering diabetes's high prevalence and impact on healthcare systems, current diabetes management in Iran requires further study.
