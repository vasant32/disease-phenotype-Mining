We compared the combined use of basal insulin, metformin and insulin secretagogues with a combination of basal insulin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes starting basal insulin analogue therapy. This analysis was part of a 24-week trial, in which 964 insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral agents (including metformin) were randomized to insulin glargine or detemir. Secretagogues were stopped or maintained at the site-investigators' discretion. During the study, 57.6% of patients continued their secretagogue treatment. Compared with patients stopping secretagogues, those who continued experienced significantly more hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Insulin doses, however, were significantly lower: 0.6 ± 0.4 versus 0.8 ± 0.4 U/kg/day (p < 0.001). The difference between groups in mean HbA1c reduction was not statistically significant. In conclusion, in type 2 diabetic patients starting basal insulin analogue therapy, continuing both metformin and secretagogues results in more hypoglycaemia and weight gain and lower insulin doses than only maintaining metformin.
