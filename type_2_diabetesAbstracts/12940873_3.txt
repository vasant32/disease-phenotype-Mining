AIMS: Hyperlipidaemia is a major predisposing factor to atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Apolipoprotein (apo) E polymorphism influences lipoprotein metabolism, and the present study was undertaken to explore the relation, in type 2 diabetics, between apo E genotype and the plasma lipid response to dietary therapy. METHODS: The subjects were 104 patients with type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidaemia, and the difference, due to apo E genotype, in dietary response was followed for 4-6 weeks. The caloric intake was maintained in the range 20-25 kcal/kg, and the medications for diabetes were not changed during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Plasma total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were significantly lowered by the dietary treatment in patients with apo E genotypes of epsilon3/3, epsilon2/3 and epsilon3/4; however, the lipid levels in patients with epsilon2/4 did not respond to the diet. CONCLUSIONS: apo E genotype should be taken into consideration in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia in diabetic patients.
