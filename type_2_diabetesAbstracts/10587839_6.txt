OBJECTIVE: It has previously been demonstrated that the risk of hypoglycemia is low among otherwise healthy elderly fasted patients with type 2 diabetes taking oral sulfonylurea medications. Nevertheless, these agents do cause hypoglycemia in clinical practice, suggesting that accompanying factors must typically be present for hypoglycemia to occur. Ethanol is one putative risk factor that has not been evaluated as a mechanism for low blood glucose among sulfonylurea users. We hypothesized that low concentrations of ethanol would reduce blood glucose concentrations in elderly type 2 diabetic patients receiving sulfonylureas during a short-term fast. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 10 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 68 +/- 3 years and receiving 20 mg glyburide daily, participated in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled in-patient study consisting of two 24-h fasts at least 1 week apart. During hours 14 and 15 of the fasting studies, subjects received intravenous infusions of either 4.35 mmol.kg-1.h-1 ethanol (equivalent to one or two alcoholic beverages) or saline placebo in random order. Ethanol, plasma glucose, insulin, and counterregulatory hormones were assessed very 30-60 min during the final 10 h of the fast. RESULTS: Blood ethanol levels peaked at 17 +/- 2 mmol/l (the lower legal limit of intoxication in New Mexico) during the ethanol study. Plasma glucose concentrations did not differ at baseline (placebo 8.5 +/- 1.8 vs. ethanol 8.7 +/- 1.7 mmol/l; P = 0.50), but nadir plasma glucose was lower after the ethanol infusion compared with placebo (4.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.4 mmol/l; P = 0.01), and the absolute decline in plasma glucose was also greater during the ethanol study than the placebo study (4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.2 mmol/l; P = 0.01). Counterregulatory hormone levels were increased during the ethanol study and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were suppressed compared with the placebo study. CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of ethanol predispose fasted elderly type 2 diabetic patients to low blood glucose during a short-term fast. This may be one of several mechanisms by which sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia occurs in elderly patients.
