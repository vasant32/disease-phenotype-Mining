 AIM: Asthma is believed to increase the risk for several proinflammatory diseases, yet epidemiologic studies on asthma in relation to risk of developing type 2 diabetes are sparse and have reported inconsistent results. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that asthma is associated with an increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes in Chinese adults. METHODS: We used data from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, including Chinese men and women aged 45-74 years, free of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes at baseline (1993-1998) and followed through 2004 for incident physician-diagnosed diabetes. Cox regression models were used to examine the associations between self-reported history of physician-diagnosed asthma and risk of diabetes. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 5.7 years per person, 2234 of the 42,842 participants included in the current analyses reported diagnoses of type 2 diabetes. After adjustment for potential confounders, not including body mass index (BMI), asthma was associated with a 31% increased risk of incident diabetes (HR=1.31; 95% CI: 1.00-1.72). The association was attenuated after adjustment for adult BMI (HR=1.25; 95% CI: 0.95-1.64). The asthma-diabetes association appeared stronger for adult- vs. child-diagnosed asthma cases, and for participants who were obese compared to non-obese. CONCLUSIONS: In Singaporean Chinese adults we observed a positive association between self-reported, physician-diagnosed asthma and risk of developing type 2 diabetes that was modestly attenuated by adjustment for BMI.
