 OBJECTIVE: Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) demonstrate chronic and progressive insulin resistance and a markedly increased risk of converting to type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this insulin resistance are unknown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the progression of insulin resistance in nine obese women with GDM during late pregnancy (30-36 weeks) and 1 year postpartum. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at each visit, and insulin resistance was determined by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. RESULTS: Insulin resistance was not significantly improved in GDM women (4.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.8 +/- 1.1 10(-2) mg x kg FFM x min(-1)/microU x ml(-1)). Subjects did not experience significant weight loss postpartum. Body weight, fat mass, fasting glucose, and plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha remained higher 1 year postpartum than seen in previously studied normal glucose-tolerant women. Skeletal muscle TNF-alpha mRNA was elevated five- to sixfold in GDM women and remained higher 1 year postpartum. While levels of insulin receptor (IR), IR substrate (IRS)-1, and p85 alpha improved postpartum, insulin-stimulated IR tyrosine phosphorylation and receptor tyrosine kinase activity did not significantly improve postpartum in GDM. The levels of (312)Ser-IRS-1 also did not improve postpartum and correlated with TNF-alpha mRNA (r(2) = 0.19, P < 0.03), consistent with a state of subclinical inflammation and chronic skeletal muscle insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the mechanisms underlying chronic insulin resistance in GDM women may be driven by increased inflammation that impinges on the IR and IRS-1 signaling cascade in skeletal muscle. These findings have important implications for the health of GDM women during subsequent pregnancies and their risk for progression to type 2 diabetes.
