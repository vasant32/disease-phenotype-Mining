The aim of this study was to investigate whether an association exists between the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Turkish patients. A total of 239 type 2 diabetic patients and 138 sex and age matched control subjects were included into the study. The I/D polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nephropathy status was determined according to urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (microg/mg) (<30 normoalbuminuria, 30-300 microalbuminuria, >300 macroalbuminuria) and retinopathy was evaluated by fundoscopic examination and by flourescein fundus angiography. The distribution of ACE I/D polymorphism and allele frequencies in diabetic patients were not significantly different from controls, DD genotype 32.2 versus 37.2%; ID genotype 50.6 versus 47.1%; and II 17.2 versus 15.2%; D allele 57.5 versus 61.2%; I allele 42.5 versus 38.8%. Genotype distribution between normo-, micro- and macroalbuminuric patients did not differ significantly (DD:ID:II (%), normoalbuminuria, 35:46:19; microalbuminuria, 28:55:17; macroalbuminuria, 31:55:14). There was also no difference in genotype distribution between patients with and without retinopathy (DD:ID:II (%), retinopathy positive, 32:51:17; retinopathy negative, 33:49:18). In conclusion, the ACE I/D polymorphism does not seem to be associated with diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in Turkish type 2 diabetic patients.
