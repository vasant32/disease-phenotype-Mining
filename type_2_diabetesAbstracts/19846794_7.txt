 OBJECTIVE: Glycated albumin (GA) relative to A1C is a useful marker of short-term glycemic control. We investigated whether endogenous insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes has different effects on GA and A1C levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A1C, GA, and GA-to-A1C ratio were compared in 202 type 2 diabetic patients by type of treatment. Effect of beta-cell function determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-%beta) on GA-to-A1C ratio was examined. In addition, GA-to-A1C ratio was compared between type 2 diabetic patients and 16 patients with type 1 diabetes. RESULTS: In type 2 diabetic patients, GA-to-A1C ratio was significantly higher in those treated with insulin than in those treated with diet or oral hypoglycemic agents. HOMA-%beta showed a significant inverse correlation with GA-to-A1C ratio. This ratio was higher in type 1 diabetic patients than in type 2 diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: In diabetic patients with decreased insulin secretion, serum GA levels are higher relative to A1C.
