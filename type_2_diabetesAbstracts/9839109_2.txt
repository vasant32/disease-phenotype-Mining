OBJECTIVE: To examine the possible association between serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentration and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 412 Korean outpatients with type 2 diabetes were examined. Diabetic retinopathy was determined by an ophthalmologist using fundoscopic examination. Serum Lp(a) levels were measured by two-site sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The patients with PDR had higher serum Lp(a) levels than those with no diabetic retinopathy or with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that high serum Lp(a) levels and the presence of diabetic nephropathy were independent variables having a statistically significant association with PDR. CONCLUSIONS: Korean type 2 diabetic patients with PDR had higher serum Lp(a) levels versus those with no diabetic retinopathy or with NPDR. Although these results suggest that Lp(a) might play a role in the occlusion of retinal capillaries leading to PDR, further prospective studies are required to prove the causal relationship.
