Thiazolidinediones, such as pioglitazone, seem to exert direct antiatherosclerotic and antirestenotic effects on type 2 diabetes, in part due to an induction of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis. We aimed to study the role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta in rat aortic VSMC. Pioglitazone at 100 micromol/l increased apoptosis without affecting DNA synthesis, and this effect was reversed by an anti-TGF-beta1 antibody. Extracellular TGF-beta1 levels were rapidly increased after treatment with pioglitazone in a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma-dependent mechanism because this secretion was blocked by the PPAR-gamma inhibitor GW9662. Pioglitazone subsequently increased the nuclear recruitment of phospho-Smad2, without any effect on protein expression. According to our results, we propose that the apoptotic effect of pioglitazone on VSMC depends on the following sequence: PPAR-gamma activation, TGF-beta1 release, and selective phospho-Smad2 nuclear recruitment. Management of Smad signaling on VSMC might provide future clinical benefits in vascular diseases.
