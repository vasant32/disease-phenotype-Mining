We examined the association between diabetic retinopathy and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 A-2518G polymorphism in 3802 Japanese type 2 diabetic subjects. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was higher as the number of G alleles increased, suggesting that the G allele of this polymorphism is a susceptibility allele for diabetic retinopathy.
