To clarify the pathogenesis of altered bone metabolism in diabetic state and its underlying mechanisms, the bone mineral content and fasting levels of serum intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH), intact osteocalcin (i-OC), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and osteoclastgenesis inhibitory factor/osteoprotegerin (OCIF/OPG) were measured in male type 2 diabetic patients and their age-matched controls. In addition, urine levels of osteoclastic markers, C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx), deoxypyridinoline (DPD), and N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) were simultaneously determined. Serum levels of i-PTH and i-OC in diabetic patients were significantly lower than those in the controls. Conversely, serum concentrations of TRAP were significantly elevated in diabetic patients. However, no clear correlation was observed between serum i-OC and TRAP. It was also observed that urinary excretion of CTx, DPD, and NTx was significantly increased in the diabetics as compared with the controls. Unexpectedly, serum levels of OCIF/OPG tended to be higher in the diabetic group, and these values exhibited a significantly positive correlation with those of serum TRAP. There was found a significantly negative correlation between serum TRAP and bone mineral density (BMD) and also between serum OCIF/OPG and bone mineral density. It seems probable that OCIF/OPG has a suppressive role on the increased bone resorption to prevent further loss of the skeletal bone mass in type 2 diabetic patients.
