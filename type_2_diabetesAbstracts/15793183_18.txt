 OBJECTIVE: Increased postprandial lipemia is part of diabetic dyslipidemia and is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. We investigated the effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist rosiglitazone on postprandial lipemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, 8-week, crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was performed in which rosiglitazone at 4 mg was administrated twice daily in 19 patients with type 2 diabetes. Standardized 6-h oral fat-loading tests were performed after each treatment period. Postprandial curves were calculated as the total area under the curve (AUC) and the incremental area under the curve (dAUC). RESULTS: Rosiglitazone did not change fasting plasma triglycerides compared with placebo (1.97 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.88 +/- 0.20 mmol/l, respectively) but decreased postprandial triglyceride levels, leading to significantly lower triglyceride dAUC (-37%, P < 0.05), without changing total triglyceride AUC. Significant postprandial triglyceride reductions in the chylomicron fraction (Svedberg flotation rate [Sf] >400) were achieved with rosiglitazone, which resulted in a significant lower triglyceride AUC (-22%) in this fraction. The postprandial triglyceride increase in VLDL1 (Sf 60-400) was also lower after rosiglitazone (-27%), but this did not result in a significant lower triglyceride AUC. In VLDL2 (Sf 20-60), there were no significant differences in triglyceride AUC and triglyceride dAUC between rosiglitazone and placebo. Rosiglitazone decreased free fatty acid (FFA) AUC (-12%) and FFA dAUC (-18%) compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Rosiglitazone improves the metabolism of large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and decreases postprandial FFA concentrations in type 2 diabetes. This may have clinical implications, as these effects may contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction.
