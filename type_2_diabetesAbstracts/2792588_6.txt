Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, a disease of complex aetiology, has been reported to be nonrandomly associated with several polymorphic markers in human populations. These data, plus evidence of a high prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus in American Indians and mixed populations, such as Mexican-Americans, which is only partially attributable to the prevalence of obesity in these populations, makes it imperative that the nature of such associations be clarified in relation to genetic susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present paper reports the results of tests of association between Type 2 diabetes mellitus and seven polymorphic markers: the blood groups - ABO, Rhesus, Duffy and Kell (K and KP) - haptoglobin and group specific component; among Anglo and Hispanic populations in the San Luis Valley of Colorado, USA. The sample population consisted of 788 individuals of which 398 were Anglo subjects (97 Types 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 301 normal individuals) and 390 Hispanic subjects (191 Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 199 normal individuals). Association between Type 2 diabetes mellitus and genetic markers in patients was tested using the G2 statistic within each ethnic class using normal frequencies as a comparison. Results of the tests indicated that only the Kell blood group was significantly associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus at a 5% level among the Anglo subjects (G2 = 5.16, 1df). This significant value can be explained by chance alone, if multiple comparisons are taken into account. Our tests have not shown the previously reported haptoglobin or Rhesus blood group associations seen in Mexican-Americans in San Antonio, Texas.
