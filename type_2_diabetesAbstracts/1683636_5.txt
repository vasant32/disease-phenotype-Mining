Insulin resistance appears to be an essential component of Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Both hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance are inherited and may precede the onset of Type 2 diabetes. To determine whether insulin receptor gene mutations, and specifically whether mutations of the beta-chain could account for the observed insulin resistance, we studied members of 16 pedigrees ascertained for two or more Type 2 diabetic siblings and members of four additional pedigrees ascertained for a mixture of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. We previously demonstrated insulin resistance among unaffected members of these pedigrees. Each pedigree was initially examined with insulin receptor restriction fragment length polymorphisms to determine whether any allele segregated with Type 2 diabetes in these pedigrees. Of the 16 pedigrees ascertained for Type 2 diabetes, at least one recombinant event between diabetes and the insulin receptor locus was present in seven pedigrees. An additional two pedigrees showed no linkage if individuals with impaired glucose tolerance were also considered affected. In all but one of the remaining pedigrees, apparent sharing of haplotypes may have resulted from insufficient polymorphism to distinguish all parental alleles. Subsequently, exons 13-21 of each allele which appeared in a Type 2 diabetic individual were examined by single strand conformation polymorphisms to detect any mutations in this region. A total of five mutations were detected, but DNA sequence analysis showed each mutation to be silent and thus not likely to result in defective insulin receptor function. No mutation detected in this fashion was present on an allele which appeared to segregate with Type 2 diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
