Bariatric surgery has recently been considered as an option for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We assessed the effect of laparoscopic gastric banding and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in a cohort of 39 T2DM Chinese patients with body mass index (BMI) over 30 kg/m(2) . Their mean body weights and BMI before surgery were 108 kg and 40 kg/m(2) , respectively, and 18 patients (46%) had suboptimal diabetic control (HbA1c >7%). After a mean follow-up of 27 months, 4 of 11 insulin-dependent patients (36%) were able to stop their insulin therapy, and 18 patients (46%) achieved remission of T2DM (HbA1c <6.5% without the use of medication). Glycaemic control remained poor in only nine other patients (27%). Logistic regression analysis showed that a short history of T2DM and high BMI could predict remission of diabetes after restrictive procedures. Our results suggest that restrictive surgery can significantly improve glycaemic control in obese T2DM patients.
