 OBJECTIVE: Women with type 2 diabetes appear to lose the protection against cardiovascular disease afforded by estrogens. We examined the effects of menopausal status on postprandial clearance of dietary fat in healthy and diabetic women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fasting subjects (premenopausal and postmenopausal control subjects, premenopausal and postmenopausal diabetic women, all n = 8) were given a meal containing the stable isotope 1,1,1-(13)C-tripalmitin, with blood and breath sampled for 6 and 24 h, respectively, in the postprandial period. Lower levels of (13)C-palmitic acid ((13)C-PA) in the triglyceride fraction implies more efficient chylomicron clearance, lower levels of (13)C-PA in the nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) fraction implies improved dietary NEFA entrapment, and higher levels of (13)CO(2) in the breath denote more efficient of oxidation of dietary-derived lipid. RESULTS: In diabetic women, there were no differences between the pre- and postmenopausal groups for any of these parameters. In contrast, premenopausal control subjects, compared with postmenopausal control subjects, had lower (13)C-PA in the triglyceride fraction area under the curve (AUC) (premenopausal median [range] 25.2 [12.1-49.4 mmol/l] per 6 h, postmenopausal 48.5 [15.5-77.2 mmol/l] per 6 h; P < 0.01) and higher (13)CO(2) levels in the breath AUC (premenopausal 22.5 [18.0-31.5%] of administered dose, postmenopausal 17.2 [11.2-31.5%] of administered dose; P < 0.01) with no difference between groups in levels of (13)C-PA in the NEFA fraction AUC. CONCLUSIONS: The premenopausal advantage in clearance of dietary lipid is not seen in premenopausal diabetic women. This is likely to promote an atherogenic lipoprotein profile and may contribute to the loss of cardiovascular disease protection seen in diabetic women.
