AIMS: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary clinical effects of the DIADEM disease management programme for type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: The study was performed at two test sites (Cardiff, UK: Aachen, Germany) including 137 and 166 patients, respectively. In 16 study centres any patients with type 2 diabetes capable of communicating by phone and able to perform blood pressure, blood glucose or urine glucose self-measurements were included. The maximum programme duration was 6 months at Cardiff and 4 months at Aachen, during which patients were assessed for glycaemic control, cardiovascular risk profile and the presence of complications of diabetes. Data were entered via the internet to a central server. RESULTS: At entry into the programme the patient group in Cardiff had significantly lower mean age (60.3+/-9.4 years versus 64.9+/-8.7 years, p<0.001) and duration of diabetes (6.1+/-5.7 years versus 7.4+/-7.0 years, p<0.05) than in Aachen, however body mass index (31.6+/-5.2 kg/m(2) versus 29.5+/-4.9 kg/m(2), p<0.01), HbA1c (7.7+/-1.2% versus 7.1+/-1.2%, p<0.001) and systolic blood pressure (138.4+/-15.1 mmHg versus 133.5+/-11.5 mmHg, p<0.001) were significantly higher. In contrast, total cholesterol (4.7+/-1.0 mmol/l versus 5.5+/-1.1 mmol/l, p<0.001) was significantly lower in Cardiff compared to Aachen. Following entry into the programme highly significant improvements in HbA1c (Cardiff from 7.7% to 7.1%, p<0.001; Aachen from 7.2% to 6.8%, p<0.05) and total cholesterol concentrations (Cardiff: 4.66-4.46 mmol/l; Aachen: 5.33-5.15 mmol/l; both p<0.05) were observed. There were no significant changes in blood pressure at either site. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive diabetes care was delivered to DIADEM patients and relevant and significant improvements in diabetes care were achieved demonstrating that an IT-based diabetes disease management service can improve care for patients with type 2 diabetes.
