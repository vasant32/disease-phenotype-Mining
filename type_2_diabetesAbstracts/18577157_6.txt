Insulin therapy becomes essential for many people with type 2 diabetes. After starting insulin, people with diabetes that is poorly controlled with oral agents typically report improved well-being and treatment satisfaction. However, healthcare professionals and people with type 2 diabetes are often reluctant to begin insulin treatment, citing concerns such as time/resources needed to educate patients, increased risks of hypoglycaemia and fear of injections, which lead them to focus on intensifying conventional oral therapy. Insulin glargine, which offers people with diabetes a once-a-day injection regimen with low risk of hypoglycaemia, is more likely to overcome such initial barriers than other more complex insulin regimens. Once-daily insulin glargine, in combination with modern glucose-dependent oral agents that do not need to be chased with food to prevent hypoglycaemia, does not require the fixed mealtimes and set amounts of carbohydrates necessary with twice-daily injection mixes and older sulphonylureas. We know that it is such dietary restrictions that cause the most damage to quality of life (QoL). To avoid damaging QoL unnecessarily and to ensure optimal satisfaction with treatment, it is important to evaluate the effects of treatment on QoL, treatment satisfaction and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) using questionnaires validated for this purpose, such as the widely used Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life measure. A systematic electronic literature search identified reports of studies evaluating PROs associated with insulin glargine in comparison with other treatments. The studies show that insulin glargine is usually associated with greater improvements in treatment satisfaction and other PROs compared with intensifying oral therapy or alternative insulin regimens.
