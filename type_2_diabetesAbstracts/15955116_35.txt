The increasing worldwide incidence of diabetes in adults constitutes a global public health burden. It is predicted that by 2025, India, China and the United States will have the largest number of people with diabetes. According to the 2003 estimates of the International Diabetes Federation, the diabetes mellitus prevalence in the USA is 8.0% and approximately 90-95% of diabetic Americans have type 2 diabetes - about 16 million people. Type 2 diabetes is a complex, heterogeneous, polygenic disease characterized mainly by insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Appropriate experimental models are essential tools for understanding the molecular basis, pathogenesis of the vascular and neural lesions, actions of therapeutic agents and genetic or environmental influences that increase the risks of type 2 diabetes. Among the animal models available, those developed in rodents have been studied most thoroughly for reasons such as short generation time, inherited hyperglycaemia and/or obesity in certain strains and economic considerations. In this article, we review the current status of most commonly used rodent diabetic models developed spontaneously, through means of genetic engineering or artificial manipulation. In addition to these models, the Psammomys obesus, rhesus monkeys and many other species are studied intensively and reviewed by Shafrir, Bailey and Flatt and Hansen.
