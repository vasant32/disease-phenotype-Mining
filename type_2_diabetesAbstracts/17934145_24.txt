 OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence rate of depression among adults with diabetes using a large population-based sample in the U.S. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a standardized telephone survey among U.S. adults aged >or=18 years, were analyzed (n = 18,814). The Patient Health Questionnaire diagnostic algorithm was used to identify major depression. RESULTS: The age-adjusted prevalence rate of major depression was 8.3% (95% CI 7.3-9.3), ranging from a low of 2.0% in Connecticut to a high of 28.8% in Alaska. There were 25-fold differences in the rate among racial/ethnic subgroups (lowest, 1.1% among Asians; highest, 27.8% among American Indians/Alaska Natives). People with type 2 diabetes who were currently using insulin had a higher rate than people with type 1 diabetes (P = 0.0009) and those with type 2 diabetes who were currently not using insulin (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Major depression was highly prevalent among people with diabetes; the prevalence rate varied greatly by demographic characteristics and diabetes types.
