We studied the effects of nateglinide on serum adiponectin in 26 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The changes in serum insulin at 30min significantly correlated with those in serum high-molecular weight adiponectin. Nateglinide may ameliorate hypoadiponectinemia as well as postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
