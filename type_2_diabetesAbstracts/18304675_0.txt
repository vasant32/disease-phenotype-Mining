 OBJECTIVE: To assess the optimal dose and timing of subcutaneous injection of insulin Aspart (IAsp) in relation to meal to mimic first phase insulin response in patients with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty patients were randomised in a double blind, double dummy design to four standard meal tests with pre-meal injection of insulin Aspart 0.08 IU/kg BW 30 min before the meal, insulin Aspart 0.04 IU/kg BW 30 or 15 min before the meal and placebo. RESULTS: All three insulin regimes significantly reduced postprandial glucose increment (area under the curve AUC(-30 to 240 min)) and peak plasma glucose increment (DeltaC(max)) compared with placebo. Postprandial glucose increment AUC(-30 to 240 min) but not DeltaC(max) was significantly lower with IAsp 0.08 IU/kg BW as compared to IAsp 0.04IU/kg BW, (p<0.03 and p=0.18). One patient experienced hypoglycaemia after injection of IAsp 0.08 IU/kg BW. No difference in postprandial glucose profile was demonstrated whether IAsp 0.04 IU/kg BW was administrated 15 or 30 min before mealtime. CONCLUSIONS: IAsp 0.04IU/kg BW injected subcutaneously 15 or 30 min before meal reduced the postprandial blood glucose increment without risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Doubling of the IAsp dose significantly reduced the postprandial glucose increment but increased the risk of hypoglycaemia.
