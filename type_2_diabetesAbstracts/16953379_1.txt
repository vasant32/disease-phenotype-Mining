AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Low birthweight is associated with insulin resistance and other insulin resistance-related phenotypes: diabetes, hypertension, and vascular disease in later life. The underlying mechanism is unclear. The foetal insulin hypothesis proposes that a single genetic predisposition to beta cell dysfunction/insulin resistance results in both reduced insulin-dependent foetal growth in utero, hence low birthweight, and predisposition to type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to test whether, as predicted by the foetal insulin hypothesis, there is an association between measures of paternal insulin resistance and offspring birthweight. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Exeter Family Study of Childhood Health (EFSOCH) is a community-based study within central Exeter (UK), established to test the foetal insulin hypothesis prospectively. Associations were tested between offspring birthweight and paternal insulin resistance, calculated by homeostasis model assessment analysis in 986 families using data relating to singleton, non-diabetic, UK white pregnancies. Ethics approval was given by the North and East Devon local ethics committee. RESULTS: Offspring birthweight was not significantly correlated with log paternal insulin resistance (r=0, p=0.91), log HDL cholesterol concentration (r=-0.02, p=0.47) or log triglyceride concentration (r=0, p=0.99) when corrected for paternal BMI and common confounders. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that paternal insulin resistance was not an independent predictor of offspring birthweight. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Results from a young, adult, non-diabetic population do not support the foetal insulin hypothesis as an explanation for the association of low birthweight with insulin resistance.
