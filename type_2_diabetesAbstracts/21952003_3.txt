 AIM: To compare the time from initial diagnosis to initiation with oral antihyperglycaemic treatment in younger versus older patients with type 2 diabetes, and to evaluate factors associated with initiating treatment. METHODS: This was a retrospective US cohort study with a 2-year follow-up period after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Using the General Electric Healthcare's Clinical Data Services electronic medical record database, eligible patients included those aged ≥30 years at initial diagnosis of type 2 diabetes between January 2003 and December 2005. In the 2-year period following diagnosis, the time to the first prescription of an oral antihyperglycaemic agent was compared between younger (30-64 years) and older (≥65 years) patients. Factors associated with time to treatment with an oral antihyperglycaemic agent were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Of the 10 743 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, 43% were ≥65 years old. The mean age at diagnosis was 73 years for older patients and 52 years for younger patients. Compared to younger patients, a greater proportion of older patients had a baseline haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value <7% (38 vs. 32%; p < 0.001). In the 2-year follow-up period, a significantly greater proportion of younger patients (59%) received oral antihyperglycaemic treatment compared to older patients (44%; p < 0.001). The median time between diagnosis and initiating treatment with an oral antihyperglycaemic agent was 350 days for younger patients and >2 years for older patients. After adjusting for covariates, older patients had a greater risk of not receiving treatment with oral antihyperglycaemic therapy than younger patients [adjusted hazard ratio = 0.82 (95% confidence interval: 0.75, 0.90)]. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, the time to initiation of oral antihyperglycaemic therapy was significantly longer in older patients (≥65 years old) than younger patients (<65 years).
