 OBJECTIVE: The FABP2 Ala54Thr polymorphism has been associated with insulin resistance and diabetes in several populations. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of FABP2 genotypes in 223 Chilean subjects (136 women and 87 men aged 65-79 years) and its association with type 2 diabetes in a 4 years follow-up. METHODS: Glucose, Insulin and lipids were measured in fasting plasma samples. Insulin resistance was estimated through the homeostasis model assessment. Diabetes was diagnosed according ADA criteria. The Ala54Thr allelic variant was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis. Logistic regression techniques were used to assess gene-disease associations. RESULTS: Genotype frequencies were estimated as 30.5, 49.3 and 20.2% for the Ala/Ala, Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr, respectively. The crude OR for the association between Thr54 carriers and diabetes was estimated as 2.18 (1.12-4.24). The corresponding OR for the association between Thr54 carriers with Metabolic Syndrome was 1.06 (0.59-1.88). After adjustment by BMI and age, a significant association persists for Thr54Thr carriers and diabetes (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.113-6.527). The 4-year cumulative incidence of diabetes was higher in Thr carriers than in non-carriers (20.1% versus 8.5%; p<0.04). The adjusted association between Thr54Thr polymorphism and diabetes incidence was OR 3.84 (95% CI: 1.140-12.910) CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest an association between the Ala54Thr polymorphism of FABP2 with diabetes, revealing a genetic dosage effect regarding its association with diabetes in Chilean elders.
