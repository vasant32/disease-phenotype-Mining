 AIM: This study was intended to cross-culturally adapt and evaluate the Chinese version of the Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL)--the Chinese Normal Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life (CN-ADDQoL) in Mainland, China. METHODS: The standard procedure for cross-culture adaptation was used to develop the Chinese version CN-ADDQoL. After the linguistic validation, the validity and reliability of CN-ADDQoL questionnaire were evaluated based on a sample of 697 Type 2 diabetes patients. The Cronbach's α coefficient, correlation analysis and the structural equation model (SEM) were applied, respectively. RESULTS: We developed 19 items for the CN-ADDQoL questionnaire. The estimated Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.941, indicating an excellent internal consistency of the scale. All items had high performance in the structural validity evaluation, with most factor loading values being larger than 0.40 (varied from 0.44 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese version CN-ADDQoL has maintained its original psychometric properties and achieved adequate reliability and validity. Therefore, it could be efficiently used to evaluate the current trend of diabetes self-management education programs and multinational clinical research trials.
