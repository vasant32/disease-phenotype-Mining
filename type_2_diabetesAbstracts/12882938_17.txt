The KK/Ta strain serves as a suitable polygenic mouse model for the common form of type 2 diabetes associated with obesity in humans. Recently, we reported the susceptibility loci contributing to type 2 diabetes and related phenotypes in KK/Ta mice. In this study, we focused on expression in the kidneys and liver of KK/Ta and BALB/c mice using differential display (DD) PCR. Zn-alpha(2) glycoprotein-1 (Azgp1) mRNA levels were increased in the kidneys and liver in KK/Ta mice, and sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation. We analyzed the relationship between this polymorphism and various phenotypes in 208 KK/Ta x (BALB/c x KK/Ta) F1 backcross mice. Statistical analysis revealed that Azgp1 and D17Mit218 exhibit a suggestive linkage to body weight (8 weeks) (logarithm of odds 2.3 and 2.9, respectively). Moderate gene-gene interactions were observed at these loci. Adiponectin mRNA levels in 3T3-L1 cells transfected with the expression pcDNA 3.1 vector containing Azgp1 coding sequence of KK/Ta mice were significantly higher than those of BALB/c mice. These results suggest that Azgp1 is a possible candidate gene for regulation of body weight, elucidation of polygenic inheritance, and age-dependent changes in the genetic control of obesity.
