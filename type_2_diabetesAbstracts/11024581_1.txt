The aim of Diabcare-Asia project was to collect data on diabetes control, management and complication status among patients in 12 Asian countries. Information was extracted from medical records, interviews and laboratory assessment. The majority (96%) of patients were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with mean age (+/-SD) of 59.3+/-12.5 years and mean diabetes duration of 9.4+/-7.0 years. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.7+/-4.9 kg/m(2) and the majority (60%) had BMI < or =25 kg/m(2). The majority (70%) of patients were treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), 15% with insulin, 10% with insulin and OAD combination therapy and 5% with diet control. Among OADs-treated patients, most (44%) received two or more medication. Majority of patients (> or =79%) had satisfactory metabolic control of triglycerides (<2.2 mmol/l), total cholesterol (<6.5 mmol/l) and HDL cholesterol (>0.9 mmol/l). Glucose self-monitoring (either urine or blood) was only practiced by 50% of patients. Glycaemic control (HbA1c) was unsatisfactory as majority of patients had HbA1c>7.4% (73%) and 50% had fasting blood glucose (FBG)>7.8 mmol/l. Cataract (26%), neuropathy (42%) and cerebral stroke (6%) were the most frequently reported complications. Clearly, the level of glycaemic control in majority of patients is below satisfaction. Effective education must be emphasised in the management of diabetes.
