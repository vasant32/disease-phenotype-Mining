 OBJECTIVE: Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. But it is still discussed whether oxidative stress precedes or merely reflects diabetic complications. The present study was carried out to search for the possibility of oxidative stress among the first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes, as they are more prone to develop type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This study has been conducted on 30 first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes and 34 healthy subjects without any known family history of diabetes. Whole blood glutathione, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonylation, fasting glucose levels and the activities of anti-oxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase, catalase and glutathione S-transferase were measured. RESULTS: The antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, plasma MDA and protein carbonyl levels were significantly elevated in the test group compared with controls. The glutathione levels were significantly decreased in the test group. CONCLUSION: This study reveals alteration of antioxidant status and oxidative stress among the first degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes.
