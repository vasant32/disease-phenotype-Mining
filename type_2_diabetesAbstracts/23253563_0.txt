Good glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with a reduced risk of diabetes complications; however, achieving and maintaining glycaemic control represents a major challenge to physicians, and despite the availability of a range of antidiabetic therapies, many patients with T2DM will eventually require insulin supplementation to reach target glycaemic levels. Insulin initiation, adjustment of the insulin dose and the need for frequent assessment of blood glucose levels are often complicated by patient and physician misconceptions and concerns regarding its use. For most patients requiring insulin therapy, dose titration is carried out by physicians; however, evidence suggests that this process may not provide optimal glycaemic management for patients. Self-monitoring of blood glucose and self-adjustment of insulin dose (insulin self-titration) is well established in type 1 diabetes, suggesting that similar therapeutic self-management may be beneficial when applied to patients with T2DM. This article reviews the rationale and clinical evidence for insulin self-titration in patients with T2DM with the aim of highlighting the importance of educating patients about insulin therapy and empowering them to manage their diabetes through self-titration of insulin.
