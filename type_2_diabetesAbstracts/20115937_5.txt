 OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship of newborn size and post-natal growth to glucose intolerance in south Indian adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 2218 men and women (mean age 28 years) were studied from a population-based birth cohort born in a large town and adjacent rural villages. The prevalence of adult diabetes mellitus [DM] and impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], and insulin resistance and insulin secretion (calculated) were examined in relation to BMI and height at birth, and in infancy, childhood and adolescence and changes in BMI and height between these stages. RESULTS: Sixty-two (2.8%) subjects had Type 2 diabetes (DM) and 362 (16.3%) had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IGT and DM combined (IGT/DM) and insulin resistance were associated with low childhood body mass index (BMI) (p<0.001 for both) and above-average BMI gain between childhood or adolescence and adult life (p<0.001 for both). There were no direct associations between birthweight or infant size and IGT/DM; however, after adjusting for adult BMI, lower birthweight was associated with an increased risk. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of IGT and Type 2 DM is associated with thinness at birth and in childhood followed by accelerated BMI gain through adolescence.
