Nateglinide, a rapid insulin secretagogue, is known to facilitate the early phase of insulin secretion and has been used for the treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with postprandial hyperglycemia. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of nateglinide on insulin resistance as well as insulin secretory defects in type 2 diabetic patients. Insulin secretion ability was evaluated by the hyperglycemic clamp test, and insulin sensitivity was evaluated by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test, using an artificial pancreas. The hyperglycemic clamp test showed that a 7-day treatment with nateglinide significantly increased insulin secretion in response to high glucose. Interestingly, although nateglinide is known to facilitate insulin secretion, daily urinary C-peptide excretion was decreased after nateglinide treatment. Moreover, in the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test, glucose infusion rate was significantly increased by nateglinide treatment, indicating that nateglinide functions to decrease insulin resistance. Nateglinide ameliorates insulin resistance as well as insulin secretory defects in type 2 diabetic patients.
