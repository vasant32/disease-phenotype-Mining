 OBJECTIVE: High plasma adiponectin is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, probably a consequence of its insulin-sensitizing properties. In vivo data in rodents suggest that the insulin-sensitization responsible for improvement of glycemia occurs in muscle and liver. Whereas associations of plasma adiponectin with muscle insulin sensitivity in humans have been examined, this has not been done for the liver. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We therefore analyzed the relationship between fasting plasma adiponectin and basal endogenous glucose production [EGP]-basal) and insulin-suppressed EGP (EGP-insulin, isotope dilution technique) in 143 Pima Indians (94 with normal glucose tolerance, 36 with impaired glucose tolerance, and 16 with type 2 diabetes). RESULTS: Fasting plasma adiponectin concentrations were negatively correlated with EGP-basal and EGP-insulin before (P = 0.006 and P < 0.0001, respectively) as well as after adjustment for age, sex, percent body fat, and insulin-stimulated whole-body glucose uptake (P = 0.007 and P = 0.0005, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that adiponectin increases hepatic insulin sensitivity. Consistent with data in animals, adiponectin may have generalized insulin-sensitizing effects in humans.
