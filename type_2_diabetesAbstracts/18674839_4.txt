The 1-h postchallenge plasma glucose (1-h PG) level is considered to be a good index of the development of glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes as well as of diabetic complications. In some cases, in Japanese, 1-h PG is elevated despite normal fasting glucose during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), but the factors responsible remain unclear. In the present study, subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were divided into subgroups at 1-h PG of 10.0mM, and the four indices of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were compared. In all three categories, the insulinogenic index in subjects with elevated 1-h PG was remarkably lower than in those without elevated 1-h PG. In addition, the insulinogenic index was the strongest factor in elevated 1-h PG according to the multiple regression analysis. Interestingly, one third of the NGT subjects enrolled in this study had elevated 1-h PG. These subjects showed significantly elevated area under the curve of glucose (G-AUC) compared to NGT subjects without 1-h PG elevation. Thus, elevated 1-h PG in Japanese subjects indicates mildly impaired glucose tolerance due to decreased early-phase insulin secretion.
