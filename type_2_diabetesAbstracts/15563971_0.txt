This study was undertaken to investigate diverse risk factors affecting the progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) by observing the changes of 24 h urinary albumin excretion (24 h UAE) in 90 abdominally obese, normal weight, type 2 diabetic patients with normo- or micro-albuminuria. Patients were divided into three groups according to the 24h UAE; normo-, micro-, and macro-albuminuria group. After 4 years of follow-up, patients were divided into either progression or non-progression group according to the changes of 24 h UAE. About 37% of the normo-albuminuria group and 18% of the micro-albumiuria group were classified into the progression group. The initial serum creatinine levels and the initial and follow-up post-prandial plasma glucose levels were significantly higher in the progression group than in the non-progression group. Most remarkably, the initial and follow-up serum triglyceride (TG) levels (190 +/- 132 versus 132 +/- 49 mg/dl and 191 +/- 124 versus 133 +/- 41 mg/dl, P < 0.01 in both) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the non-progression group, suggesting hypertriglyceridemia might be included in the progression factors of DN. The increases in 24-hour UAE were positively associated with the initial and follow-up post-prandial plasma glucose levels (P < 0.05 in both), the initial and follow-up serum creatinine levels (P < 0.05 in both), and the initial serum TG levels (P < 0.05). Whereas, insulin users or patients with retinopathy at follow-up (P < 0.05 in both) showed more rapid progression of albuminuria, ACE inhibitors or acarbose (P < 0.05 in both) use turned out to protect against it.
