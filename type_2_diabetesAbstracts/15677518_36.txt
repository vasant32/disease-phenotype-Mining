Rare mutations in the glucokinase (GCK) gene cause fasting hyperglycemia and considerably influence birth weight when present in a mother or her offspring. The role of common variation of GCK is uncertain. A polymorphism at position -30 of the GCK beta-cell-specific promoter, present in 30% of the population, has been variably associated with type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related quantitative traits. Using 1,763 U.K. Caucasian normoglycemic adult subjects, we demonstrated that the A allele at GCK(-30) is associated with a 0.06-mmol/l increase in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (P = 0.003). The A allele was also associated with an increase in FPG in 755 women who were 28 weeks pregnant (0.075 mmol/l, P = 0.003). We then went on to analyze the effect of GCK(-30) on birth weight using 2,689 mother/child pairs. The presence of the A allele in the mother was associated with a 64-g (25-102 g) increase in offspring birth weight (P = 0.001). We did not detect a fetal genotype effect. The increase in offspring birth weight in the 30% of mothers carrying an A allele at GCK(-30) is likely to reflect an elevated FPG during pregnancy. This study establishes that common genetic variation, in addition to rare mutations and environmental factors, can affect both FPG and birth weight.
