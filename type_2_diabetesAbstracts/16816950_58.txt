 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We assessed the effects of vildagliptin, a novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor, on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in patients with type 2 diabetes. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind study in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients received vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily, n=15) or placebo (n=16) for 4 weeks. Triglyceride, cholesterol, lipoprotein, glucose, insulin, glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) responses to a fat-rich mixed meal were determined for 8 h postprandially before and after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, 4 weeks of treatment with vildagliptin decreased the AUC(0-8h) for total trigyceride by 22+/-11% (p=0.037), the incremental AUC(0-8h) (IAUC(0-8h)) for total triglyceride by 85+/-47% (p=0.065), the AUC(0-8h) for chylomicron triglyceride by 65+/-19% (p=0.001) and the IAUC(0-8h) for chylomicron triglyceride by 91+/-28% (p=0.002). This was associated with a decrease in chylomicron apolipoprotein B-48 (AUC(0-8h), -1.0+/-0.5 mg l(-1) h, p=0.037) and chylomicron cholesterol (AUC(0-8h), -0.14+/-0.07 mmol l(-1) h, p=0.046). Consistent with previous studies, 4 weeks of treatment with vildagliptin also increased intact GLP-1, suppressed inappropriate glucagon secretion, decreased fasting and postprandial glucose, and decreased HbA(1c) from a baseline of 6.7% (change, -0.4+/-0.1%, p<0.001), all relative to placebo. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Treatment with vildagliptin for 4 weeks improves postprandial plasma triglyceride and apolipoprotein B-48-containing triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle metabolism after a fat-rich meal. The mechanisms underlying the effects of this dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor on postprandial lipid metabolism remain to be explored.
