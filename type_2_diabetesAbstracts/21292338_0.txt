 AIMS: To determine whether short-term strict glycaemic control could restore incretin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients. The factors associated with incretin levels were also investigated. METHODS: A meal tolerance test (MTT) was performed in eighteen poorly controlled (pDM) and fifteen well controlled (wDM) diabetic patients. Fourteen patients in the pDM group underwent follow-up MTT after strict glycaemic control. The secretions of intact glucagon-like peptide-1 (iGLP-1) and total glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (tGIP) during MTT were calculated by total and incremental area under the curve (TAUC and IAUC) values. RESULTS: Posttreatment HbA1c level was significantly improved in the pDM group (11.2±0.9 to 7.9±0.9%). However, the secretion of incretin hormones was not increased in the posttreatment pDM group (TAUCiGLP-1, 3612±587 to 2916±405 pmol/L min; TAUCtGIP, 9417±1099 to 8338±903 pmol/L min). IAUCiGLP-1 was negatively correlated (r=-0.446, P=0.011) and independently associated (β=-137.2, P=0.027) with insulin resistance assessed by homeostasis model assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Incretin secretion is not restored by short-term strict glycaemic control. Decreased incretin secretion seems to develop early in the course of type 2 diabetes with increasing insulin resistance, but not to be influenced by glycaemic status.
