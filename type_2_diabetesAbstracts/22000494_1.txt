Metformin is a cornerstone in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Although its mechanism of action is not well understood, there is new evidence about its possible role in cancer. A Pubmed search from 1990 to 2011 was done using the terms metformin, cancer, mechanism of action, diabetes treatment and prevention. We found more than one thousand articles and reviewed studies that had assessed the efficacy of metformin in treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes and its mechanisms of actions, as well as articles on its antitumoral effects. We found that the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study and the Diabetes Prevention Program have demonstrated the efficacy of metformin in terms of treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes; metformin is safe, cost effective and remains the first line of diabetes therapy with diet and exercise. The mechanisms of action include a decrease of hepatic insulin resistance, change in bile acids metabolism, incretins release and decreased amyloid deposits. The AMP-activated protein kinase seems to be an important target for these effects. Epidemiological retrospective studies point out a possible association between metformin and decreased cancer risk, data supported by in vitro and animal studies. These data should trigger randomized controlled trials to prove or disprove this additional benefit of metformin.
