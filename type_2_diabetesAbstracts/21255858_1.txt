 AIM: In this study we investigated if the -786T>C, the VNTR intron 4 a/b and the 894G>T (Glu298Asp) polymorphisms in the eNOS gene were associated with renal disease in 617 type 2 diabetic Caucasian-Brazilians. These polymorphisms were also examined in 100 Caucasian healthy blood donors. METHODS: Genotyping of eNOS polymorphisms was performed by PCR or PCR-RFLP and haplotype frequencies were estimated using a Bayesian method. Logistic regression analysis was done to test for association of eNOS polymorphisms with susceptibility to renal involvement (microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria or end-stage renal disease). This analysis was carried out assuming three different genetic models for the minor allele, adjusting for possible effect modifiers. RESULTS: Genotype and allele frequencies in patients with renal disease were not significantly different from those of patients with normoalbuminuria and healthy blood donors for all eNOS polymorphisms. Likewise, there were no differences in haplotype frequencies among healthy blood donors and type 2 diabetic patients with or without renal involvement (P>0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: No associations between the -786T>C, the VNTR intron 4 a/b and the 894G>T (Glu298Asp) polymorphisms in the eNOS gene and renal disease were observed in type 2 diabetic Caucasian-Brazilians.
