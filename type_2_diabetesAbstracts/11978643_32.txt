Acute suppression of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) activity improves glucose tolerance in the Zucker fatty rat, a rodent model of impaired glucose tolerance, through stabilization of glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1. This study describes the effects of a new and potent DPP-IV inhibitor, FE 999011, which is able to suppress plasma DPP-IV activity for 12 h after a single oral administration. In the Zucker fatty rat, FE 999011 dose-dependently attenuated glucose excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test and increased GLP-1 (7-36) release in response to intraduodenal glucose. Chronic treatment with FE 999011 (10 mg/kg, twice a day for 7 days) improved glucose tolerance, as suggested by a decrease in the insulin-to-glucose ratio. In the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, a rodent model of type 2 diabetes, chronic treatment with FE 999011 (10 mg/kg per os, once or twice a day) postponed the development of diabetes, with the twice-a-day treatment delaying the onset of hyperglycemia by 21 days. In addition, treatment with FE 999011 stabilized food and water intake to prediabetic levels and reduced hypertriglyceridemia while preventing the rise in circulating free fatty acids. At the end of treatment, basal plasma GLP-1 levels were increased, and pancreatic gene expression for GLP-1 receptor was significantly upregulated. This study demonstrates that DPP-IV inhibitors such as FE 999011 could be of clinical value to delay the progression from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes.
