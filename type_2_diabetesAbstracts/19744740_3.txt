 AIMS: To test whether the genetic variant CCR5Delta32 in the CC-chemokine receptor 5, which is known to lead to CCR5 deficiency, is associated with mortality in type 2 diabetes patients. METHODS: We examined the effect of presence or absence of the CCR5Delta32 on overall and cardiovascular mortality risk in the Zwolle Outpatient Diabetes project Integrating Available Care (ZODIAC) cohort, a type 2 diabetes patient cohort. RESULTS: We studied 756 patients with a mean duration of follow-up of 5.4 (+/- 1.4) years. 194 patients died during follow up of which 83 were cardiovascular deaths. 144 subjects (19%) carried the CCR5Delta32 deletion. CCR5Delta32 carriers had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.62 (95%CI: 0.40-0.96; p=0.03) for all-cause mortality and 0.63 (95%CI: 0.33-1.19; p=0.16) for cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CCR5Delta32 is associated with better survival in type 2 diabetes patients. These data suggest that it is worthwhile to explore the protective potential of pharmacological blockade of CCR5 in type 2 diabetic patients.
