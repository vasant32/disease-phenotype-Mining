 AIMS: To investigate whether leisure time physical activity (LTPA) characteristics differ between individuals with previously undiagnosed (screen-detected) and those with previously diagnosed (known) type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A population-based random sample of 1364 (participation rate 61%) men and 1461 (65%) women aged 45-74 years participated in a cross-sectional health examination including an oral glucose tolerance test and physical activity assessment by a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Women with screen-detected type 2 diabetes (n=110) were physically less active than those with known type 2 diabetes (n=68) with differences in the duration of physical activity sessions (multivariate-adjusted P=0.041) and the number of moderate to high intensity exercise sessions per week (multivariate-adjusted P=0.007). In men no differences in LTPA were observed between individuals with screen-detected (n=126) and with known type 2 diabetes (n=109). CONCLUSIONS: This study supplies indirect evidence that in women, but not in men, with diagnosed type 2 diabetes exercise counselling or other treatment related factors produces the desired increase in LTPA.
