 OBJECTIVE: An important mechanism in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in obese individuals is elevation of plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), which induce insulin resistance and chronically decrease beta-cell function and mass. Our objective was to investigate the role of oxidative stress in FFA-induced decrease in beta-cell function. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used an in vivo model of 48-h intravenous oleate infusion in Wistar rats followed by hyperglycemic clamps or islet secretion studies ex vivo and in vitro models of 48-h exposure to oleate in islets and MIN6 cells. RESULTS: Forty-eight-hour infusion of oleate decreased the insulin and C-peptide responses to a hyperglycemic clamp (P < 0.01), an effect prevented by coinfusion of the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and taurine. Similar to the findings in vivo, 48-h infusion of oleate decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion ex vivo (P < 0.01) and induced oxidative stress (P < 0.001) in isolated islets, effects prevented by coinfusion of the antioxidants NAC, taurine, or tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl). Forty-eight-hour infusion of olive oil induced oxidative stress (P < 0.001) and decreased the insulin response of isolated islets similar to oleate (P < 0.01). Islets exposed to oleate or palmitate and MIN6 cells exposed to oleate showed a decreased insulin response to high glucose and increased levels of oxidative stress (both P < 0.001), effects prevented by taurine. Real-time RT-PCR showed increased mRNA levels of antioxidant genes in MIN6 cells after oleate exposure, an effect partially prevented by taurine. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are the first demonstration that oxidative stress plays a role in the decrease in beta-cell secretory function induced by prolonged exposure to FFAs in vitro and in vivo.
