 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of Mg + Zn, Vitamins C + E, and combination of these micronutrients on serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles in type 2 diabetic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, 69 type 2 diabetic patients were randomly divided into four groups, each group receiving one of the following daily supplement for 3 months; group M: 200 mg Mg and 30 mg Zn (n = 16), group V: 200mg Vitamin C and 150 mg Vitamin E (n = 18), group MV: minerals plus vitamins (n = 17), group P: placebo (n = 18). Fasting blood and urine samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the trial. Serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) were measured enzymatically. Apolipoproteins (apo) A1 and B were measured by immunoturbidimetric method. Adjustment for differences in baselines covariates and changes in variables during study were performed by analysis of covariance using general linear models. RESULTS: Results indicate that after 3 months of supplementation mean serum levels of HDL-c and apo A1 increased significantly in the MV group by 24% (50.4 +/-19.3 mg/dl versus 40.6 +/- 10.8 mg/dl) and 8.8% (169.8 +/- 33.8 mg/dl versus 156.1+ /- 23.9 mg/dl), respectively (P < 0.01). There were no significant changes in the levels of these parameters in the other three groups. Serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL-c, triglyceride, and apo B were not altered after supplementation in all four groups. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that since co-supplementation of Mg, Zn, Vitamins C and E significantly increases HDL-c and apo A1, supplementation of these micronutrients could be recommended for the type 2 diabetic patients based on their daily requirements.
