 AIMS: To examine differences in attitudes and behaviours towards familial risk of type 2 diabetes in populations in Ireland and Bahrain. METHODS: Cross-sectional ecological study. Questionnaires were developed and administered to patients with diabetes and their first degree relatives in both Bahrain and Ireland. Data was analysed using non-parametric tests of association. RESULTS: Responses were compared between 297 patients with diabetes from Ireland and 201 from Bahrain and between 364 relatives of patients with diabetes in Ireland and 244 from Bahrain. Relatives in Bahrain had more knowledge of risk factors for diabetes and an increased perception of the seriousness of diabetes but a more external, chance locus of control and perceived more barriers to changing lifestyles than those in Ireland. There was no difference in perception of personal risk of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of risk factors and seriousness of diabetes are higher in Bahrain than in Ireland but perception of personal risk of diabetes and intention to adopt risk reducing behaviours are no different. There is a need to develop models of behavioural change that are more relevant to the needs of the Bahraini population in reducing their risk of diabetes.
