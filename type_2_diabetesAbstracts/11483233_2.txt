PURPOSE: The study was performed to test the effect of a structured intervention in diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control in an ophthalmological department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All the patients attending the ophthalmological out-patient department with the need for laser therapy due to diabetic retinopathy were investigated from January to March 1998 (Type 1: n=20, Type 2: n=144). If an HbA(1c)-level higher than 9.0% was found the patient was informed within 1 week and a standardised letter was sent to the primary care physician and the local ophthalmologist. Over the first 3 months of 1999 the effect was evaluated. RESULTS: HbA(1c) values higher than 9.0% were found in eight/20 of the patients (40%) with Type 1 diabetes and in 61/144 of the patients (54%) with Type 2 diabetes. In 55% this new information in the context of the need for laser therapy resulted in the acceptance of a structured intervention by the patient. This led to an improvement of the HbA(1c) in the people with Type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Patients with poor blood glucose control can be identified in an ophthalmological department. The need for laser therapy can be used to motivate the patients for a significant improvement of the quality of blood glucose control.
