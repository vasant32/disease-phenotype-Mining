 DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of fasting serum lipid and lipoprotein levels, pre-heparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mass, several other metabolic parameters, and intra-abdominal fat areas in 26 Japanese poorly controlled type 2 diabetic men and 23 women when matched for age, body mass index (BMI), and HbA1c between genders. SUBJECTS: Study subjects were Japanese type 2 diabetic patients who were admitted to our hospital between Jun 2001 and Aug 2002 because of their poorly controlled diabetes. A total of 49 subjects [40-79 years of age, average age 61.5 +/- 8.7; mean BMI 23.2 +/- 3.7 kg/m2] with fasting plasma glucose (PG) and HbA1c levels being 251 +/- 76.5 mg/dl and 10.8 +/- 2.2%, respectively, were involved in this study. METHODS: Pre-heparin LPL mass was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Remnant like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) level was measured using an immunoaffinity mixed gel containing anti-apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and anti-apo B monoclonal antibodies. Serum leptin level was determined by radioimmunoassay. Intra-abdominal fat area was determined by computerized tomography analysis at the umbilical level. RESULTS: The men group showed a higher serum triglycerides (TG) and RLP-C levels, and lower high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels and pre-heparin plasma LPL mass than did women. Serum leptin level was higher in women than in men counterparts. The intra-abdominal subcutaneous fat areas were significantly larger in women than in men counterparts, whereas the visceral fat areas did not differ. CONCLUSION: In Japanese population, poorly controlled type 2 diabetic men had more unfavorable lipid profile than did women counterparts, which may be associated with decreased lipolysis of plasma TG-rich lipoproteins by LPL.
