Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly prevalent disease with oral health manifestations. In this study, titanium implants were placed in the femora of 10 type 2 diabetic and 10 age-matched normal rats. We compared the results of bone histomorphometry around the dental implants at 4 and 8 weeks postsurgery.
