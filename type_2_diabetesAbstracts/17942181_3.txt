AIMS: This feasibility trial evaluated the use, safety, and short-term benefits of a home-based exercise intervention designed to increase physical activity among adults with diabetes. METHODS: Participants with type 2 diabetes in a group practice were recruited and randomly assigned to the home-based exercise intervention or usual care. Participants were given diabetes self-management education, instructed to exercise 30 min 5 days/week, and were followed for 3 months. The intervention contained three exercise routines (aerobic and resistance exercises). Outcomes included changes from baseline at 3 months between groups in body mass index (BMI), quality of life, A1C, and blood pressure. RESULTS: Seventy-six sedentary adults completed the study: 49% intervention group, 68% women, 47% black, mean age 56.6+/-9.6 years. Using intention to treat analysis, a trend towards improvement between groups for BMI (mean change -0.4 versus 0.1, respectively; P=0.06) was identified. Thirty-eight percent of the intervention group adhered to 80% of the exercise recommendation and significantly improved BMI (-1.07; P<0.05). No other differences were detected between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Home-based exercise interventions have potential to reduce BMI in patients with diabetes. The results provide variance estimates necessary to power a larger study of longer duration.
