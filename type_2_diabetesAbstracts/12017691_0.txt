The injection of insulin is essential for management of patients with type 1 diabetes and may be needed by patients with type 2 diabetes for intermittent or continuous glycemic control. The species and dosage of insulin used should be consistent, and the patient's injection technique should be reviewed periodically with the diabetes-care team. The effective use of insulin to obtain the best metabolic control requires an understanding of the duration of action of the various types of insulin and the relationship of blood glucose levels to exercise, food intake, intercurrent illness, certain medications, and stress; SMBG; and learning to adjust insulin dosage to achieve the individualized target goals established between the patient, family, and diabetes-care team.
