Kidney tissue of acceptable quality was available from autopsies of 55 patients who had been followed prospectively for 3 to 15 years as participants in the University Group Diabetes Program, a study of vascular disease in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients. Slides were prepared for light microscopic reading by uniform histologic techniques, and then were randomly intermixed and coded with tissues identically prepared from matched non-diabetic subjects (morphologic controls). After independent review by three morphologists, the results were tabulated and assigned to one of four diagnostic groups: 1) typical diabetic nodular glomerulosclerosis; 2) mesangial changes suggestive of diabetes (diffuse lesion); 3) non-diabetic renal disease; 4) normal for age. Of the diabetic cases 31% (17 of 55) were found to show nodular glomerulosclerosis, and another 47% (26 of 55) showed suggestive changes; none of the morphologic control slides was read as showing nodular glomerulosclerosis, but some were judged to show suggestive mesangial (diffuse) changes. Although only 4 of the 17 diabetic patients with nodules had died of uraemia, many had hypertension, which may have contributed to their deaths from vascular disease. The patients with nodular glomerular changes also showed, on the average, the highest blood glucose levels during life. Type 2 diabetes in later life appears to be associated with a high risk for typical tissue changes of diabetic kidney damage, which may contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality and may be present before azotaemia and qualitative proteinuria have been recognized.
