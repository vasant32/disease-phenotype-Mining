This study sought to identify determinants of albuminuria in people with Type 2 diabetes. In 335 primary care patients, we assessed albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in two 24-h urine samples, and its cross-sectional associations with protein and alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, body weight and height, glycosuria, blood pressure, hypoglycaemic and antihypertensive treatment, gender, age, age at diagnosis, diabetes duration, family history of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, ethnic origin, and education. The prevalence of micro- or macro-albuminuria (ACR> or =2.0 mg/mmol) was 33%. Among these patients, compared to those with normo-albuminuria, there were more men, protein intake (g/kg) estimated from urinary urea as well as systolic blood pressure and glycosuria were higher, there were more smokers, men were shorter, and a family history of diabetes was less prevalent (all P<0.05). In linear and logistic regression (n=270) albuminuria was independently associated (P<0.05 unless indicated otherwise) with systolic blood pressure (OR(10 mmHg)=1.32), smoking (OR(ex/never)=2.36, OR(current/never)=4.89), glycosuria (OR(> or =7/<1 g/l)=2.41), gender (OR(men/women)=2.50), age in men (OR(10 year)=1.60) (P<0.10) and, inversely, in women (OR(10 year)=0.63) (P>0.10). On aggregation, the modifiable determinants systolic blood pressure, smoking and glycosuria explained 12% of the variation in albuminuria. These factors thus are, although to a moderate extent only, potential determinants of albuminuria. We also observed an independent, inverse association with body height (OR(0.10 m)=0.47). This is in line with the hypothesis that development in utero or during early life influences kidney function in later life.
