 OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin (a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor) and voglibose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) monotherapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c > or =6.5% and <10.0%) on diet and exercise. METHODS: In a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, 319 patients were randomized (1:1) to 12-week treatment with sitagliptin 50 mg once daily or voglibose 0.2 mg thrice daily before meals. The primary analysis assessed whether sitagliptin was non-inferior to voglibose in lowering HbA1c. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, sitagliptin was non-inferior to voglibose for HbA1c-lowering efficacy. Furthermore, sitagliptin was superior to voglibose, providing significantly greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline [least squares mean changes in HbA1c [95% confidence intervals (CI)] = -0.7% (-0.8 to -0.6) and -0.3% (-0.4 to -0.2), respectively; between-group difference = -0.4% (-0.5 to -0.3), p < 0.001]. Sitagliptin was also superior to voglibose on other key efficacy endpoints, including change from baseline in 2-h postmeal glucose (-2.8 mmol/l vs. -1.8 mmol/l, p < 0.001) and fasting plasma glucose (-1.1 mmol/l vs. -0.5 mmol/l, p < 0.001). After 12 weeks, the incidences of clinical adverse experiences (AEs), drug-related AEs and gastrointestinal AEs in the sitagliptin group (48.5, 10.4 and 18.4%, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than those in the voglibose group (64.7, 26.3 and 34.6%, respectively). The incidences of hypoglycaemia, serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were low and similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, once-daily sitagliptin monotherapy showed greater efficacy and better tolerability than thrice-daily voglibose over 12 weeks.
