 AIM: The aim of this study is to characterize the glucometabolic state of patients undergoing elective coronary angiography (CA) in a subpopulation in China. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study recruited 896 patients undergoing elective CA for the evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) performed in patients without previously known diabetes revealed that 173 (19.2%) had newly diagnosed diabetes and 281 (31.5%) had impaired glucose regulation. The prevalence of abnormal glucose metabolism (AGM) was significant difference among three groups of CA diagnosis, including normal coronary, nonsignificant stenosis and CAD. Overall, the proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes increased from 22.0% at baseline to 41.2% post-OGTT analysis. In total, 270 (59.5%) patients with AGM would have remained undetected if OGTTs had not been performed. Patients with CAD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and high C-reactive protein levels were at high risk of AGM. CONCLUSIONS: AGM is common and underestimated by FPG testing alone in patients undergoing elective CA. OGTTs should be routinely performed to assess the glucometabolic state of patients undergoing elective CA, especially in patients with high risks of AGM. Detecting the state of AGM in CA individuals may provide strategies to reduce the progression of AGM and associated complications.
