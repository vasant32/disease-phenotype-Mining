Liraglutide is a once-daily human glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). It has been prospectively investigated in a series of multinational, randomised, controlled phase 3 trials (the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes programme), as well as in an additional direct head-to-head study with sitagliptin. These trials were designed to clarify the use and safety of liraglutide in clinical practice across the treatment continuum of T2D, and consequently involved a large number and diverse range of patients. These studies also included active comparisons against antidiabetic agents including metformin, rosiglitazone, glimepiride, insulin glargine, exenatide and sitagliptin, and therefore have helped to examine clinical differences and similarities between liraglutide and these commonly used agents.
