AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diets high in saturated fat are thought to be a risk factor for Type 2 diabetes and associated complications. We investigated effects of a medium and high saturated fat diet on the development of diabetes-associated pathologies in Golden Syrian hamsters, an animal that reacts to dietary lipids in a fashion similar to humans. METHODS: Three diets containing 46.5 kcal %, 267.3 kcal %, and 488.2 kcal % as saturated fat respectively, were studied. Metabolic parameters were measured up to 20 weeks. Electron microscopy was used to examine the structure of the pancreas, aorta and kidney. RESULTS: Increased saturated fat consumption was associated with: (i) gradual imbalance of homeostasis, and severe structural alterations of acinar, beta cells and capillaries in the pancreas, and of the kidney glomeruli; (ii) severe hypertriglyceridaemia and augmented creatinine concentrations related to disturbances of the renal function, progressing to nodular glomerulosclerosis and nephropathy; (iii) reduced early insulin secretion in response to glucose; (iv) switch of the aortic endothelium to a secretory phenotype. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: The results show that high-caloric saturated fat intake induced diabetes in hamsters, probably linked to delayed insulin secretion. The model was also associated with the development of a range of pathologies characteristic to human diabetes, including nephropathy and defects in vasculature. Thus, high-fat fed hamsters provide a new model that is likely to be useful in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes.
