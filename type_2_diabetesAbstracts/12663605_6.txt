 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of serum extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes and to assess whether increased EC-SOD concentration is associated with the development of diabetic vascular complications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum EC-SOD concentrations were determined in 222 patients with type 2 diabetes and 75 healthy control subjects by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All subjects had the EC-SOD domain genotyped. RESULTS: The serum EC-SOD concentrations showed a distinct bimodal distribution in both patients with diabetes and control subjects. All subjects with the high-level phenotype carried the Arg213Gly mutation. The frequency of this variant was similar in the diabetes and control groups. Within the group of subjects with the common EC-SOD phenotype, the serum EC-SOD concentration (mean +/- SE) was significantly higher in patients with type 2 diabetes (99.3 +/- 1.3 ng/ml) compared with the control subjects (68.4 +/- 2.3 ng/ml, P < 0.01). Stepwise multiple regression analysis of the data from the diabetic common phenotype group showed a significant relationship between serum EC-SOD concentration and duration of diabetes (F = 5.31), carotid artery intimal-media thickness (F = 8.24), and severity of nephropathy (F = 16.05) and retinopathy (F = 4.43). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a strong relationship between the serum concentration of EC-SOD and the severity of both micro- and macrovascular diabetic complications. These findings suggest that serum EC-SOD concentration levels may be a marker of vascular injury, possibly reflecting hyperglycemia-induced oxidative injury to the vascular endothelium and decreased binding of EC-SOD to the vascular wall.
