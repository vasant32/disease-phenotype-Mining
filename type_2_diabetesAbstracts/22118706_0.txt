Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease characterized by worsening hyperglycaemia. Lowering haemoglobin A1c to below or around 7% has been shown to reduce microvascular and neuropathic complications of diabetes. The ongoing uncertainty regarding whether intensive glycaemic control can reduce the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in people with T2DM stirred the launch of the recent long-term megatrials. These trials compared the effects of intensive vs. standard control on vascular complications in relatively high CV risk participants with T2DM. While in Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial, and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, the effect of glucose optimization resulted either in no protection or in an excessive CVD death, the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation trial showed that intensive glycaemic control reduced the risk of combined major macrovascular and microvascular events. In this trial, the glucose control strategy was based on gliclazide MR at randomization in all patients and then further sequential addition of other glucose-lowering drugs. Several studies showed that gliclazide has antioxidant properties, reduces markers of endothelial inflammation, and prevents glucose-induced apoptosis of endothelial cells. These positive antioxidant effects are not confined to the vascular wall but they are effective also in the Î² cells. These properties are important because (i) in patients with atherosclerotic process, microvascular abnormalities may hasten disease progression and (ii) slowing the microvascular complications may have a potentially remarkable effect on the natural history of macrovascular disease.
