 OBJECTIVE: There is increased stiffness of the large central arteries in type 2 diabetic patients, and obesity is a risk factor. However, the effect of intentional weight loss on arterial stiffness is uncertain, and the purpose of the current study was to assess this effect. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Arterial stiffness was assessed by measuring aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) at baseline and at completion of a 1-year weight loss intervention. Metabolic control of type 2 diabetes was also appraised. RESULTS: Mean weight loss at 1 year in 38 volunteers with type 2 diabetes was 7.8%. There were improvements in HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and inflammatory markers (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein). There was also a significant improvement in aPWV at completion of weight loss intervention, from 740 to 690 cm/s (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate weight loss improves arterial stiffness in type 2 diabetes.
