 AIMS: The circadian rhythm and immune system are thought to be associated with the pathological state of diabetes. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation of circadian rhythm disturbance including sleep disturbance with the immune state in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Nineteen patients with type 2 diabetes (11 males and 8 females; aged 46-85 years) and 19 healthy controls (7 males and 12 males; aged 45-85 years) were recruited, and the presence of circadian rhythm disturbance including sleep disturbance was examined using an actigraph. Immunological parameters were also measured. RESULTS: Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances were more frequently noted in diabetic patients than in healthy controls. Higher fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were correlated with stronger sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances. The levels of B lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, natural killer activity, and several cytokines were increased in diabetic patients compared to healthy controls. Correlations were shown among sleep disturbance (circadian rhythm disturbance), immunological measures, and diabetic indices. CONCLUSION: The exacerbation of diabetes was related to the level of sleep disturbance, circadian rhythm disturbance, and activation of the immune system.
