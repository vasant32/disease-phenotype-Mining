Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) reverses type 2 diabetes (DM2) in approximately 83% of patients with morbid or severe obesity. This procedure has been performed in small numbers of severely obese patients with type 1 diabetes (DM1), but the impact on glycemic control and insulin requirement in this population has not been widely described. We report three patients with DM1 and severe obesity that underwent RYGB. Weight, glycemic control, and insulin requirements before and one year after the procedure were compared. Significant weight loss was achieved by all three patients but insulin requirements decreased in only 2 patients. In contrast, glycemic control (A1C) remained suboptimal in all three patients up to one year after the surgery. These findings suggest that RYGB leads to important weight loss and positively affects insulin sensitivity. However, reaching optimal glycemic control in patients with DM1 diabetes remains challenging due to persisting insulin deficiency.
