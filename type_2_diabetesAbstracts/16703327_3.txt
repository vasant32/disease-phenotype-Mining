AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Hyperfibrinogenaemia and albuminuria are cardiovascular risk factors, often coexisting in diabetic and non-diabetic people. Albuminuria in turn is associated with a compensatory albumin overproduction in non-diabetic patients. It is not known whether the presence of albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with greater albumin and fibrinogen production rates than in normoalbuminuric patients. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Using leucine isotope methods, we measured fractional and absolute synthesis rates (FSR, ASR) of albumin and fibrinogen in post-absorptive type 2 diabetic patients with either normal (n=11) or increased (n=10) urinary albumin excretion. RESULTS: In albuminuric patients, albumin FSR (16.2+/-1.5%/day) and ASR (20.5+/-1.9 g/day) were greater (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively) than in normoalbuminuric patients (FSR=11.5+/-1.1%/day; ASR=15.7+/-1.2 g/day). Fibrinogen FSR was similar between patients with normal and increased albumin excretion, but concentration, the circulating pool and ASR of fibrinogen were 40 to 50% greater (p<0.035) in patients with albuminuria. Albuminuria was positively correlated with albumin ASR, with fibrinogen concentration, the fibrinogen pool and ASR, whereas albumin synthesis was inversely correlated with calculated oncotic pressure. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Synthesis of albumin and fibrinogen is upregulated in type 2 diabetic patients with increased urinary albumin excretion. Albuminuria is associated with enhanced fibrinogen and albumin synthesis.
