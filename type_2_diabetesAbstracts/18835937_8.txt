 OBJECTIVE: White adipose tissue is a critical regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. Preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) is a secreted protein that inhibits adipocyte differentiation, both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we have investigated the effects of Pref-1 overexpression on whole-body glucose homeostasis and its contribution to the development of insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To gain insight into the role of Pref-1 on the onset of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we measured body composition and whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in Pref-1 transgenic and wild-type control mice fed a high-fat diet. RESULTS: Mice overexpressing Pref-1 were resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity, as reflected by a marked reduction in adipose tissue mass. However, Pref-1-overexpressing mice were severely insulin resistant, mainly because of a reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The aggravated insulin resistance was associated with impaired insulin signaling and increased diacylglycerol content in skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Mice overexpressing Pref-1 are insulin resistant despite being protected from diet-induced obesity and may provide a new rodent model for the study of lipodystrophic disorders.
