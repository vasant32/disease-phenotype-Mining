Diabetes is classified clinically into two types: type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune diabetes, whereas, in contrast, type 2 diabetes is nonautoimmune. However, there is a group of phenotypic adult type 2 diabetic patients ( approximately 10%) who have islet autoantibodies similar to type 1 diabetes. These patients are said to have latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or type 1.5 diabetes. T-cells reacting with islet proteins have been demonstrated in type 1 and type 1.5 diabetic patients. In contrast, classic autoantibody-negative type 2 diabetic patients are also negative for T-cell responses to islet proteins. Therefore, we questioned whether type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes are similar or different autoimmune diseases. We have investigated the immunological and metabolic differences between type 1, type 1.5, and classic type 2 diabetic patients. We have identified autoantibody differences, differences in islet proteins recognized by T-cells, and differences in insulin resistance. We have also identified a small group of patients who have T-cells responsive to islet proteins but who are autoantibody negative. These patients appear to be similar to type 1.5 patients in having decreased stimulated C-peptide values. These immunological differences between type 1 and type 1.5 diabetes suggest at least partially distinct disease processes.
