Fifty patients with Type 2 diabetes were recruited for a study assessing treatment satisfaction and well-being, following commencement on insulin during routine clinical care. A month after starting insulin, participants completed a Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) and a Well-being Questionnaire. At seven months, the same questionnaires and clinical measurements were repeated and, in addition, patients completed a Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (change) (DTSQc). Mean HbA1c decreased from 9.69 to 8.26% (P < 0.001), and the lipid profile showed a corresponding improvement. BMI increased from 30.9 to 32.0 kgm(-2) (P < 0.001). Perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia decreased (P = 0.021), correlating with the change in HbA1c (r = 0.399, P = 0.006). The DTSQc showed improvements at seven months in scores for treatment satisfaction, convenience, flexibility, understanding of diabetes, willingness to recommend the treatment to others, and satisfaction to continue current treatment (all P < 0.001). There was no relationship between weight gain, HbA1c and total or subscale scores. In summary, after seven months of insulin treatment, patients reported positive changes in their perception of treatment satisfaction. These findings, in conjunction with the known health benefits of improved glycaemic control, should encourage practitioners to consider insulin early in the management of Type 2 diabetes.
