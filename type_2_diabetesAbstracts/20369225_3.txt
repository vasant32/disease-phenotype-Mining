 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 diabetes is characterised by decreased beta cell mass and islet amyloid formation. Islet amyloid formed by aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is associated with beta cell apoptosis. We used human and transgenic mouse islets in culture to examine whether deletion of caspase-3 protects islets from apoptosis induced by endogenously produced and exogenously applied hIAPP and compared hIAPP toxicity in islet alpha and beta cells. METHODS: Human and wild-type or caspase-3 knockout mouse islet cells were treated with hIAPP. Rat insulinoma INS-1 cells were similarly cultured with hIAPP and the amyloid inhibitor Congo Red or caspase-3 inhibitor. Human and hIAPP-expressing caspase-3 knockout mouse islets were cultured to form amyloid fibrils and assessed for beta and alpha cell apoptosis, beta cell function and caspase-3 activation. RESULTS: hIAPP-treated INS-1 cells had increased caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, both of which were reduced by inhibitors of amyloid or caspase-3. Similarly, hIAPP-treated human and mouse islet beta cells had elevated active caspase-3- and TUNEL-positive cells, whereas mouse islet cells lacking caspase-3 had markedly lower beta cell but comparable alpha cell apoptosis. During culture, human islets that formed amyloid had higher active caspase-3- and TUNEL-positive beta cells than those without detectable amyloid. Finally, cultured hIAPP-expressing mouse islets lacking caspase-3 had markedly lower beta cell apoptosis than those expressing caspase-3, associated with an increase in islet beta cell/alpha cell ratio, insulin content and glucose response. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Prevention of caspase-3 activation protects islet beta cells from apoptosis induced by fibrillogenesis of endogenously secreted and exogenously applied hIAPP. Islet beta cells are more susceptible to hIAPP toxicity than alpha cells cultured under the same conditions.
