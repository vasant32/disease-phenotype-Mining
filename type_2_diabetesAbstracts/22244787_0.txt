 AIMS: The present study investigated alteration of abdominal visceral fat mass (VFM) and its relationship to adipokines and insulin resistance (IR) in obese and non-obese type 2 diabetes and normoglycemic subjects. METHODS: Twenty-two diabetic patients and 37 normoglycemic controls were subgrouped into obese and non-obese according to their BMI. VFM was quantified by computed tomography. Plasma adiponectin and resistin, two adipokines exert contrary effects on insulin sensitivity were measured. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by an established HOMA model. RESULTS: Obese subjects showed remarkably expanded VFM, while non-obese diabetes obtained more abundant VFM than non-obese controls (104 ± 50 cm(2)vs. 77 ± 26 cm(2), P<0.05). Plasma adiponectin was only significantly decreased in obese diabetes. Plasma resistin was increased in diabetes, but compared between obese and non-obese subjects. Diabetic patients and obese controls were significantly insulin resistant. HOMA-IR index positively correlated to VFM in both groups (r=0.563, P=0.011 for diabetes and r=0.671, P=0.000 for controls). In diabetes but not controls, plasma adiponectin negatively related to VFM (r=-0.687, P=0.000) and HOMA-IR index (r=-0.659, P=0.002), while resistin had no relation to IR and VFM in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increased VFM may lead to IR by mechanisms beyond adipokines in Chinese type 2 diabetic and normoglycemic subjects.
