OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to reveal the effect of low intensity bicycle exercise on the insulin-induced glucose uptake in obese patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven obese men with Type 2 diabetes (OBDM) and seven healthy young men (HY) participated in this study. The glucose infusion rate (GIR) was determined by glucose clamp procedure at an insulin infusion rate of 40 mU m-2 min-1 (plasma insulin concentrations: 700-800 pmol l-1). Confirming stabilized GIR, a 30-min bicycle exercise was performed during the glucose clamp which was continued for 120 min after exercise. RESULTS: Average GIR in OBDM for last 30 min prior to exercise were significantly lower than HY (28.3 +/- 1.7, 47.4 +/- 1.8 mumol kg-1 min-1 respectively, P < 0.05). GIR abruptly increased during exercise and gradually decreased after exercise to the nadir almost at the time from 30 to 60 min in recovery period in both groups. GIR in OBDM, however, gradually increased significantly over pre-exercise levels (P < 0.05), following exercise and reached the same levels compared to HY after 80 min of recovery period. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that in obese Type 2 diabetes, 30 min of low intensity bicycle exercise significantly enhances the lower level of insulin-induced glucose uptake shortly after exercise and might be useful for the treatment of post-prandial hyperglycemia.
