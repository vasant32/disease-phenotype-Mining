Recent studies suggest that the gene encoding aldose reductase, the enzyme that converts glucose to sorbitol, may confer susceptibility to microvascular disease. The aim of this study therefore, was to investigate the relationship between the aldose reductase gene and type 2 diabetic microvascular complications such as diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy. DNA from 127 Korean patients with type 2 diabetes was typed for an (AC)(n) dinucleotide repeat polymorphic marker at the 5'-end of the aldose reductase gene using polymerase chain reaction. No significant difference in the frequency of the putative risk allele Z-2 was found in patients of nephropathy and retinopathy groups compared with the uncomplicated group (32.2, 34.1 vs. 25.1%, respectively, P>0.05). Similarly, no difference was found in the frequency of the putative protective allele Z+2 among any of the study groups. In conclusion, the results of the study in Korean type 2 diabetic patients do not support the hypothesis that polymorphism at the 5' end of the aldose reductase gene contributes to the susceptibility to diabetic microvascular complications.
