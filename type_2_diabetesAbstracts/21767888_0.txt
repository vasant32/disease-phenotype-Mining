Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex, progressive disease affecting an estimated 257 million people worldwide. A number of unmet needs exist with traditional T2DM therapies, which can lead to insufficient glycaemic control and increased risk of diabetes-associated complications. An emerging class of diabetes therapeutics, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, appear to address many of the unmet needs of patients with T2DM. This review summarises the recent findings and current clinical guidelines of the currently approved GLP-1 receptor agonists and explores the new GLP-1 receptor agonists in development. It also concentrates on the physiological basis for early use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, their use as an alternative to insulin therapy, the rationale for combining them with insulin and their cost-effectiveness.
