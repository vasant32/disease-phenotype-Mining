<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors described 20 consecutive series of Le Fort III midfacial distraction using internal distraction devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two types of devices were utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One type was a zygoma-skull device (the anterior part of the device is attached to the zygoma, and the posterior part is attached to the skull), which was used in six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The other was a zygoma-zygoma device (the anterior and posterior parts of the device are attached to the osteotomized zygoma, respectively), which was used in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subject ages ranged 3-32 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 14-20-mm distraction length was obtained by 1 mm/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Satisfactory distraction of the midface was obtained in 17/20 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3/6 cases in which a zygoma-skull device was used, an unsatisfactory result was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these three cases, a fracture of the zygomatico-maxillary suture was encountered, resulting in the Le Fort III portion being left behind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 cases in which a zygoma-zygoma device was used, a satisfactory result was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the distraction period, the connection of the distraction device was dislodged, resulting in re-connection in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Slight asymmetry was noticed in two cases without any need for management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain parallel setting of the bilateral distraction devices, a newly developed parallel bar was used and demonstrated to be effective </plain></SENT>
