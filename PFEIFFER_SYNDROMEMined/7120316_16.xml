<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A family study was based on 184 consecutive patients who had undergone surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> at The Hospital for Sick Children, London, between 1953 and 1976 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 127 were traced and visited and are the probands for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> was recognised in 16, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> in 11, Saethre-Chotzen in nine, and Pfeiffer in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, two probands had Saethre-Chotzen-like facies and bilaterally broad big toes owing to partial or complete duplication of the distal phalanx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This syndrome is distinct from Pfeiffer syndrome, in which the facies more closely resembles that in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> and in which it is the proximal phalanx of the big toe (and often of the thumb) which is abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that this newly recognised syndrome be called after Robinow and Sorauf, who appear to be the first to have described a family with the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One proband with coronal stenosis had a mother and brother affected, but no syndrome was recognised in them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excluding this last case, no non-syndromic proband had an affected parent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 58 probands with predominantly sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> had 106 sibs, none of whom was affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 21 probands with predominantly coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> included one sib pair both affected; the remaining 17 sibs were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The four probands with predominantly metopic stenosis had 13 unaffected sibs and the four with multiple sutures involved had eight unaffected sibs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One sagittal proband had an unaffected monozygotic twin and another an unaffected dizygotic twin </plain></SENT>
