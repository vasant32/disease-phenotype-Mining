<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we characterized the effects of one of the mutations (S252W) using primary calvarial osteoblasts derived from transgenic mice, Ap-Tg and sAp-Tg, that expressed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>-type mutant FGFR2 (FGFR2IIIc-S252W; FGFR2IIIc-Ap), and the soluble form (extracellular domain only) of the mutant FGFR2 (sFGFR2IIIc-Ap), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to WT-derived osteoblasts, osteoblasts from Ap-Tg mouse showed a higher proliferative activity and enhanced differentiation, while those from sAp-Tg mouse exhibited reduced potential for proliferation and osteogenic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When transplanted with β-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9679">tricalcium phosphate</z:chebi> (β-TCP) granules into immunodeficient mice, Ap-Tg-derived osteoblasts showed a higher bone forming capacity, whereas sAp-Tg-derived osteoblasts were completely deficient for this phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), MEK, PLCγ, and p38 was increased in Ap-Tg-derived osteoblasts, whereas phosphorylation of these signaling molecules was reduced in sAp-Tg-derived osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, when these experiments were carried out using osteoblasts from the mice generated by crossing Ap-Tg and sAp-Tg (Ap/sAp-Tg), which co-expressed FGFR2IIIc-Ap and sFGFR2IIIc-Ap, the results were comparable to those obtained from WT-derived osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results indicate that osteoblasts expressing FGFR2IIIc-Ap proliferate and differentiate via highly activated MEK, ERK, and p38 pathways, while these pathways are suppressed in osteoblasts expressing sFGFR2IIIc-Ap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings also suggest that altered FGFR2IIIc signaling in osteoblasts is mostly responsible for the phenotypes seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, therefore these osteoblast cell lines are useful tools for investigating the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
