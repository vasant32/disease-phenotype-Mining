<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by craniosysnostosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo>, broad and medially <z:hpo ids='HP_0009603'>deviated thumbs</z:hpo>, and great toes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006101'>partial syndactyly</z:hpo> of the digits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we described clinical and genetic features of 12 unrelated Thai individuals with PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo>, and advanced paternal age was found in 50% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction sequencing of FGFR1 exon 5 and FGFR2 exons 8, 10, 15, 16, and 17 was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PS patients and revealed 9 recurrent mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of the mutations clustered in exons 8 and 10 (9/12) accounting for 75% of PS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequently detected mutation, p.S351C, was associated with the severe form of PS in the Thai population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Less frequent mutations in exons 16 (p.K641R) and 17 (p.G663E) were also identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the p.P252R mutation in FGFR1 was detected in 1 PS patient with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004440'>coronal craniosynostosis</z:hpo> expanding the phenotypic spectrum of PS with this particular mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Knowing the mutation spectrum of the responsible genes could lead to the most effective strategy in identifying mutations causing Pfeiffer syndrome in the Thai population </plain></SENT>
