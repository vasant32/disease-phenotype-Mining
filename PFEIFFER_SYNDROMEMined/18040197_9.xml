<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The authors studied the effect of midface distraction on maxillary skeletal position and clinical appearance in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Pfeiffer, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndromes</z:e>, and examined the stability of these changes at 1 year after distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients (six male and nine female; average age, 5.9 years) underwent Le Fort III osteotomy with midface advancement using a rigid external distraction device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, five had Pfeiffer, and four had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Midface advancement was initiated at the level of the occlusal splint and at the zygomatic/maxillary anchor screws </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The device was activated 11 mm on average, at a rate of 1 mm per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty anatomical landmarks were identified and digitized at three time intervals, and displacement of each landmark was compared with its pretreatment position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By the time of device removal, point A had advanced sagittally along the x axis 15.85 mm and moved downward 1.06 mm along the y axis; the orbitale was moved sagittally along the x axis 12.72 mm and downward 1.99 mm along the y axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maximum mean advancement (17.16 mm) was observed at the upper incisal edge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maxillary and mandibular skeletal discrepancy was significantly decreased, with the ANB angle changing from -5.87 to +13.17 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 1 year after distraction, point A had advanced an additional 0.81 mm, and the orbitale and upper incisal edge had moved posteriorly 0.07 mm and 1.34 mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Significant midface advancement can be achieved and maintained with rigid external distraction of the Le Fort III osteotomy segment (up to 24 mm), with excellent stability of the advanced midfacial skeleton </plain></SENT>
