<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY GROUP: Fifty-seven children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and their matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: The decayed, missing, and filled teeth and surfaces in both the deciduous (dmfs and dmft) and the permanent dentition (DMFS and DMFT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plaque and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000230'>gingivitis</z:hpo> scores and developmental enamel defects were also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000670'>caries</z:hpo>-related microflora was sampled using an alginate swab and the prevalence of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus and Candida species were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The dmfs (p &lt;.02) and dmft (p &lt;.01) were significantly greater in the control children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plaque score for the deciduous dentition only (p &lt;.02) and also the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000230'>gingivitis</z:hpo> score for the permanent teeth only (p &lt;.008) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> group were significantly greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total aerobic <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> count (p &lt;.004), anaerobic count (p &lt;.002), and Candida count (p &lt;.05) were significantly greater in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of S. mutans both as a percentage of the total anaerobic count (p &lt;.04) and the total streptococcal count (p &lt;.05) was significantly greater in the control group </plain></SENT>
