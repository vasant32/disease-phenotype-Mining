<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a female infant with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>craniofacial dysmorphism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> in which a de-novo apparently balanced translocation between chromosomes 7 and 18 [46,XX,t(7;18)(p15.3;q11.2)] was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional cytogenetic and molecular investigations identified a cryptic interstitial 7.6-10.6-Mb deletion of the region between bands 7p21.2 and 7p21.3 on the derivative chromosome 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deletion was of paternal origin and contained the TWIST1 gene, although her features were not completely characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The phenotype of this patient is likely further complicated by loss of other genes within the deleted region and/or disruption of a critical gene(s) at the sites of the breakpoints on chromosomes 7 and 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the need for a systematic molecular study of breakpoints and the surrounding chromosomal regions in patients with apparently balanced rearrangements and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
