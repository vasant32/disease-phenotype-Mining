<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In about 30% of the patients with syndromal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, a genetic mutation can be traced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the purpose of adequate genetic counseling and treatment of these patients, the full spectrum of clinical findings for each specific mutation needs to be appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A number of studies on the relationship between genotype and phenotype concerning this specific mutation have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two Dutch families with Muenke syndrome were screened for the reported characteristics of this syndrome and for additional features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New phenotypical findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the frontal sinus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> of the upper eyelids, dysplastic elbow joints with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002996'>restricted elbow motion</z:hpo>, and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0010554'>cutaneous syndactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incidentally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010442'>polydactyly</z:hpo>, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">ankylosis</z:e> of the elbow, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002949'>fusion of cervical vertebrae</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Upper eyelid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo> is thought to be pathognomonic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> but was also observed in our series of patients with Muenke syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because Muenke and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> can have similar phenotypes, DNA analysis is needed to distinguish between these syndromes, even when a syndrome diagnosis is already made in a family member </plain></SENT>
