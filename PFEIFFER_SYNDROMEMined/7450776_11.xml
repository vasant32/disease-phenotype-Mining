<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, deformed chest, weight and height deficiency, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, as well as, in the boys, true <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiological examination showed, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected members of the family, intensified digitate impressions within the whole fornix of the skull, large and deep sella turcica, underdeveloped frontal bone and upper jaw bone, untypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> of hands and feet, and the partial bifid of distal phalanges of the great toes, not described previously in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
