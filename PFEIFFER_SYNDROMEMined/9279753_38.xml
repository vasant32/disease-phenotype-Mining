<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several mutations involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene family have been identified in association with phenotypically distinct forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such point mutation, resulting in the substitution of proline by arginine in a critical region of the linker region between the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains, is associated with highly specific phenotypic consequences in that mutation at this point in FGFR1 results in Pfeiffer syndrome and analogous mutation in FGFR2 results in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now show that a much more variable clinical presentation accompanies analogous mutation in the FGFR3 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, apparently unrelated to the management of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, appears to be a variable clinical consequence of this FGFR3 mutation </plain></SENT>
