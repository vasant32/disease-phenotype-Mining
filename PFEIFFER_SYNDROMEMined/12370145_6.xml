<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient eventually responded to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6067">isotretinoin</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The morphological profile of the sebaceous glands and the expression of proliferative markers and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptors were evaluated in seboblasts and sebocytes using morphological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in staining for proliferative markers and nuclear expression of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptors in the glands from the patient and four healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results support the view that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001061'>acne</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> is not sustained by abnormalities of the sebaceous glands demonstrable with conventional morphological techniques, and that it does not depend on an increased expression of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
