<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency appears to be the pathogenic mechanism involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possibility that complete deletions of the TWIST gene also contribute to this disorder, we have developed a comprehensive strategy to screen for coding-region mutations and for complete gene deletions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous TWIST mutations were identified in 8 of 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> and in 2 of 43 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> patients with no clear diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to six coding-region mutations, our strategy revealed four complete TWIST deletions, only one of which associated with a translocation was suspected on the basis of conventional cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case and two interstitial deletions were detectable by analysis of polymorphic microsatellite loci, including a novel (CA)n locus 7.9 kb away from TWIST, combined with FISH; these deletions ranged in size from 3.5 Mb to &gt;11.6 Mb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining, much smaller deletion was detected by Southern blot analysis and removed 2,924 bp, with a 2-bp orphan sequence at the breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant learning difficulties were present in the three patients with megabase-sized deletions, which suggests that haploinsufficiency of genes neighboring TWIST contributes to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results identify a new microdeletion disorder that maps to chromosome band 7p21.1 and that causes a significant proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
