<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several craniofacial deformities and syndromes feature <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the midface skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until now different treatment options were based primarily on a modified LeFort III osteotomy: (1) the conventional LeFort III osteotomy with bone transplantation and intraoperative osteosynthesis, (2) distraction using subcutaneous distraction devices fixed on both sides at the os zygomaticum, and (3) bone distraction using a rigid external distraction device (RED distractor), which is fixed to the skull and pulling at the maxilla or the upper teeth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: A modification of the distraction technique using the RED distraction device is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tensile forces are applied to the ramus infraorbitalis or the apertura piriformis, and the tensile wires penetrate through the skin laterally to the nose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By using this new approach near the center of rotation or the center of resistance, optimal control of the vector of distraction is guaranteed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With sufficient distraction of the midface, overcorrection of the os zygomaticum can be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical data of seven patients are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Due to the good clinical results, external transfacial distraction with tensile forces pulling at the apertura piriformis seems to improve the treatment of these complex facial deformities </plain></SENT>
