<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report on the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and dosage-sensitive Southern blot analysis in the molecular diagnosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: FISH and dosage-sensitive Southern blot analysis utilizing TWIST gene probes were performed on patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> but without an identifiable TWIST sequence variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four unrelated patients with a deletion of the TWIST gene were identified by Southern blot; one of them had a complex chromosomal rearrangement involving 7p21 and no apparent deletion by FISH, suggesting a smaller deletion in the region including the TWIST gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A fifth patient had an abnormal TWIST gene fragment on Southern blot analysis that segregated with the disease in the family; FISH was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in this patient, suggesting a partial deletion or rearrangement in or near the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FISH and dosage-sensitive Southern blot analysis are useful diagnostic tools in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> without TWIST sequence variation </plain></SENT>
