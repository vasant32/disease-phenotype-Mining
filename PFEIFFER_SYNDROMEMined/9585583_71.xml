<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine novel and three recurrent TWIST mutations were found in 12 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven families were found to have the FGFR3 P250R mutation, and one individual was found to have an FGFR2 VV269-270 deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, our detection rate for TWIST or FGFR mutations is 68% in our <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> patients, including our five patients elsewhere reported with TWIST mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More than 35 different TWIST mutations are now known in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common phenotypic features, present in more than a third of our patients with TWIST mutations, are coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000294'>low frontal hairline</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000324'>facial asymmetry</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>ptosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010055'>broad great toes</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactyly</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant intra- and interfamilial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> is present for either TWIST mutations or FGFR mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overlap in clinical features and the presence, in the same genes, of mutations for more than one craniosynostotic condition-such as Saethre-Chotzen, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, and Pfeiffer syndromes-support the hypothesis that TWIST and FGFRs are components of the same molecular pathway involved in the modulation of craniofacial and limb development in humans </plain></SENT>
