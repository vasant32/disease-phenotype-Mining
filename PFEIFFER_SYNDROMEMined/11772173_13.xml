<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Prenatal ultrasound images of 19 patients with postnatally diagnosed metopic or coronal suture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 26 ultrasound examinations obtained were compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> images and tables of gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was not possible to diagnose <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second trimester, Kleeblattsch채del was diagnosed at 20.5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A multilobular shape to the skull and diastasis of the frontotemporal suture was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a second child with Kleeblattsch채del, the cephalic index was above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 86.4 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range 70 to 86), and the head circumference to abdominal circumference was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the third trimester, the head shape deformation was more obvious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>Brachycephaly</z:hpo> diagnosis was made in the second trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> was identified at 19.9 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>Plagiocephaly</z:hpo> was diagnosed at 21.4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000243'>trigonocephaly</z:hpo> the reduced cephalic index was noted at 18.8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the third trimester, the deformity was diagnosed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> was made in the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the second trimester, it was possible to diagnose Kleeblattsch채del, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000243'>trigonocephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> (bilateral coronal suture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo> (unilateral coronal suture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>) in nine of the examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the third trimester and at term, it was possible to diagnose previously listed conditions from six of the seven examinations obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Kleeblattsch채del was suspected during original examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 examinations of 26 were correctly diagnosed during this investigation </plain></SENT>
