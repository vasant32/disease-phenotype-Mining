<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In-depth computationally based structural analysis of human fibroblast growth factor type 1 (FGFR1) protein carrying disease-causing mutation was performed in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gain or loss of function due to missense mutations in FGFR1 is responsible for a variety of disorders including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KAL3">Kallmann syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, Pfeiffer syndrome, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mutant model of the human FGFR1 protein was subjected to various in silico analysis, and most deleterious SNPs were screened out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, docking and long molecular dynamics simulations were carried out with an intention of studying the possible impact of these mutations on the protein structure and hence its function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of various structural properties-especially of those of the functionally important regions: the extracellular immunoglobulin domain and intracellular Tyrosine kinase domain-gave some insights into the possible structural characteristics of the disease mutant and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> forms of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a nutshell, compared to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein, the mutant structures V273M and S685F are associated with significant changes, and the functionally important regions seem to adopt such structures that are not conducive for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>-like functionality </plain></SENT>
