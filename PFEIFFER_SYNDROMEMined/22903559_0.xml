<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GCPS is mainly characterised by craniofacial abnormalities (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011220'>prominent forehead</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo>) and limb malformations, such as <z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>-IV, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005696'>postaxial polydactyly type A</z:hpo> or B (PAPA/B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the GLI3 gene can also lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265220" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pallister-Hall syndrome</z:e> (PHS) and isolated PAPA/B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated 16 unrelated probands with the clinical diagnosis of GCPS/<z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>-IV and found GLI3 mutations in 12 (75%) of them (nine familial and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also performed a detailed clinical evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 12 GLI3-positive families, with a total of 27 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hallmark triad of GCPS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100258'>preaxial polydactyly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011220'>prominent forehead</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo>) was present in 14 cases (52%), whereas at least one typical dysmorphic feature was manifested in 17 patients (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Upon sequencing of the GLI3 gene, we demonstrated eight novel and two previously reported heterozygous point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to screen for intragenic copy number changes and identified heterozygous deletions in the two remaining cases (16.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings fully support previous genotype-phenotype correlations, showing that exonic deletions, missense mutations, as well as truncating variants localised out of the middle third of the GLI3 gene result in GCPS/<z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>-IV and not PHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additionally, our study shows that intragenic GLI3 deletions may account for a significant proportion of GCPS/<z:chebi fb="48" ids="51403,53543">PPD</z:chebi>-IV causative mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we propose that MLPA or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) should be implemented into routine molecular diagnostic of the GLI3 gene </plain></SENT>
