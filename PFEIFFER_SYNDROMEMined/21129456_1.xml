<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, early clinical investigations indicated that <z:mp ids='MP_0000164'>abnormal cartilage development</z:mp> in the cranial base was rather a primary site of abnormal feature in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert Syndrome</z:e> (AS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To examine the significance of cartilaginous growth of the cranial base in AS, we generated a transgenic mouse bearing AS-type mutant Fgfr2IIIc under the control of the Col2a1 promoter-enhancer (Fgfr2IIIc(P253R) mouse) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite the lacking expression of Fgfr2IIIc(P253R) in osteoblasts, exclusive disruption of chondrocytic differentiation and growth reproduced AS-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030044" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephaly</z:e> accompanied by short anterior cranial base with fusion of the cranial base synchondroses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000327'>maxillary hypoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> of the calvarial sutures with no significant abnormalities in the trunk and extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analyses demonstrated upregulation of p21, Ihh and Mmp-13 accompanied by modest increase in expression of Sox9 and Runx2, indicating acceleration of chondrocytic maturation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in the cranial base of the Fgfr2IIIc(P253R) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an acquired affinity and specificity of mutant FGFR2IIIc(P253R) receptor with FGF2 and FGF10 is suggested as a mechanism of activation of FGFR2 signaling selectively in the cranial base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this report, we strongly suggest that the acrocephalic feature of AS is not alone a result of the coronal suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp>, but is a result of the primary disturbance in growth of the cranial base with precocious endochondral ossification </plain></SENT>
