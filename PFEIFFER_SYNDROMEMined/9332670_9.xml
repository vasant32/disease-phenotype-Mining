<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence from mouse development also shows that Fgf8 may play an important role in growth and patterning of limbs, face, and the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here the human FGF8 genomic sequence and demonstrate conservation between the human and mouse sequences, including alternatively spliced exons in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mapping of FGF8 by FISH using an FGF8-containing <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> artificial chromosome and by genetic linkage using a SSCP variant identified in this study is also reported and refines the FGF8 map location to 10q24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since FGF8 maps to the same chromosomal region as FGFR2, has indeed been shown to be a ligand for FGFR2, and has an expression pattern consistent with limb and craniofacial anomalies, we have screened two kindreds with Pfeiffer syndrome that were previously linked to markers from 10q24-25 and a large number of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and limb anomalies for mutations in the coding sequence of FGF8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While no such mutations were identified, a rare polymorphic variant, consisting of an 18-base-pair (six-amino-acid) duplication in exon 1c, is reported that apparently has no clinical effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our exclusionary data suggest that mutations in FGF8 would be, at best, an infrequent cause of such disorders </plain></SENT>
