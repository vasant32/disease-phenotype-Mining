<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apart from the more obvious skull malformations, extensive and complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001155'>hand deformities</z:hpo> create several problems for the child's interaction with its environment, preventing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intellectual development and generating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306597" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychological problems</z:e> as severe as those caused by the craniofacial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The deformities seen here are some of the most complex of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> congenital hand malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between January 1987 and January 1999, 71 children presenting with hand <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> were treated at the Hospital de Dona Estefania (H.D.E.), a total of 177 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactylies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of those, 51 had no associated illnesses, 14 had other conditions and six had A.S </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The timing at which the various surgeries were performed was diverse, however, there has been a recent trend towards earlier interventions in order to obtain a functional hand before the age of two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aesthetic results vary a lot depending on the complexity of the lesions and we sometimes accept a three or four-digit, but functional hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We achieved hands with a function of 40 to 65 % in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our patients before school age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to A.S.' rarity, an effective use of resources and good results can only be obtained in a specialised centre with a multidisciplinary team </plain></SENT>
