<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Frontofacial monobloc advancement (FFMBA) is a powerful but high-risk procedure to correct both exorbitism and impaired airways of faciocraniosynostosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and five children with faciocraniosynostosis (mean 4.9 years, 7 months-14 years) were evaluated prospectively after FFMBA and quadruple internal distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The advancement was started at day 5 (0.5 mm/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 61 months (maximum 10.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relapse was evaluated by the comparison between the evaluation at the time of removal of distractors and 6 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (72%) completed their distraction uneventfully in the initial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications: - One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at D1 from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> before beginning of distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>- Cerebrospinal fluid leaks managed conservatively (11 patients) and with transient lumbar drainage (eight patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>- Revision surgery (dysfunction/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>) of distraction devices (nine patients, subsequently four completed the distraction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ninety-nine out of 104 patients finally completed their distraction, resulting in exorbitism correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>Respiratory impairment</z:hpo>, when present, was corrected and class I occlusal relationship was obtained in 77% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reossification was limited at the orbital level but relapse could be prevented by a retention phase of 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pfeiffer syndrome, previous surgeries, and surgery before 18 months of age were risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Internal distraction allows early correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo> and exorbitism of faciocraniosynostosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In order to limit the risks, we advise: - Preliminary craniovertebral junction decompression if needed - Four devices to customize the distraction - Double pericranial flap to seal the anterior cranial fossa - Systematical external transient drainage if CSF leak - Slow rate of distraction (0.5 mm/day) - Long consolidation phase (6 months) </plain></SENT>
