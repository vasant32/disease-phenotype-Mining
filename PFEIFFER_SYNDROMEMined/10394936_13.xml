<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we set out to examine the exons in FGFR2 most commonly associated with mutations in PS, exons IIIa and IIIc, in a panel of 78 unrelated individuals with PS by the most sensitive method (direct DNA sequencing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a total of 18 different mutations among 40 patients; eight of these mutations have not been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutational spectrum displays a non-random character with the frequent involvement of cysteine codons </plain></SENT>
