<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>Variable expressivity</z:hpo> has involved mostly the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> and the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> when present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type 2 consists of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">ankylosis</z:e> of the elbows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such patients do poorly with an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Type 1 is commonly associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence, generally good outcome, and can be found dominantly inherited in some families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Types 2 and 3 generally have severe neurological compromise, poor prognosis, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recognition of type 3 is particularly important because extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>ocular proptosis</z:hpo> in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> but with various visceral anomalies can result in failure to diagnose Pfeiffer syndrome and labeling the patient as an "unknown" or as a "newly recognized entity."(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
