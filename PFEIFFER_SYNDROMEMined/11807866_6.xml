<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three clinical subtypes have been delineated based on the severity of acrocephalysyndactyly and associated manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Severe cases are usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> and caused by a number of different mutations in exons IIIa and IIIc of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mild cases are either <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> or familial and are caused by mutations in FGFR2 or FGFR1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report on two individuals with different novel de novo mutations in FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first is a 17-year-old male who has a severe phenotype, within the spectrum of subtype 1 including severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>ocular proptosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003070'>elbow ankylosis</z:hpo>, visceral anomalies, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intelligence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient was found to have a novel complex mutation at the 3' acceptor site of exon IIIc of FGFR2, denoted as C952-3 del10insACC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other patient, a 2-year-old female, has a mild phenotype, typical of the classic subtype 1 including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> with coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She was also found to have a mutation at the 3' acceptor site (the same splice site) of exon IIIc of FGFR2, a point mutation designated as 952-1G--&gt;A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Speculation on the molecular mechanisms that cause severe and mild phenotypes is presented in relation to these two cases </plain></SENT>
