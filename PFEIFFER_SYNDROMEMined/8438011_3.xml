<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective study of the frequency and factors that portend <z:hpo ids='HP_0000663'>enophthalmos</z:hpo> following orbital osteotomies and transposition for craniofacial malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically obvious postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000663'>enophthalmos</z:hpo> (POE) was noted in 23 (37.7 percent) of 61 patients undergoing such procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000663'>enophthalmos</z:hpo> was observed in 86 percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> patients who had combined anteromedial orbital transposition and in 48 percent of patients with hypertelorbitism who had standard 360-degree osteotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000663'>enophthalmos</z:hpo> was 21 percent following frontofacial (monobloc) or subcranial (Le Fort III) advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000663'>enophthalmos</z:hpo> also correlated with the occurrence of orbital fracture/fragmentation and with disruption of the periorbita </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study underscores the importance of establishing the correct relationship of the globe to the orbital rim (euophthalmos) while maintaining the spatial position of the eye, especially its anterior projection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000663'>enophthalmos</z:hpo> can be prevented by inserting bone grafts into orbital osteotomy gaps, correcting orbital volume/<z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> following floor or wall outfracture/fragmentation, and preserving the periorbital supporting system </plain></SENT>
