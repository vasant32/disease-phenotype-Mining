<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, many studies have focused on mutant skull and long bone malformation, only few studies have focused on mandible changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone formation and micro-architecture between 28- and 56-day-old mutant mice and controls were compared to investigate the changes in the mandibular micro-architecture caused by the Fgfr2(S252W/+) mutation to provide a basis for exploring the pathogenesis and therapeutic measures of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fgfr2(S252W/+) mutant mice were established, and their general characteristics, including weight, naso-anal length, and calcium and phosphate content in serum and bone were tested </plain></SENT>
