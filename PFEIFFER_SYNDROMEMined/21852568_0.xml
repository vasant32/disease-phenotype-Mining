<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical ethics committee approved this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians before imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A prospective study was performed in children with syndromic and complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> aged 6-14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients were included: four had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, 14 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>-Pfeiffer syndrome, eight had Muenke syndrome, 11 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, and eight had complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, seven control subjects were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For diffusion-tensor imaging, an echo-planar sequence was used with a diffusion gradient (b = 1000 sec/mm(2)) applied in 25 noncollinear directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the following white matter structures: pontine crossing tract, corticospinal tracts, medial cerebral peduncles, uncinate fasciculus (measured bilaterally), anterior commissure, frontal and occipital white matter (measured bilaterally), fornix, corpus callosum (measured in the genu and splenium), and corpus cingulum (measured bilaterally) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eigenvalues were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ROIs and fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measured ROIs, FA values were generally lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients combined than in the control subjects (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences among subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diffusion-tensor imaging measurements of white matter tracts reveal significant white matter integrity differences between children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This could imply that the developmental delays seen in these patients could be caused by the presence of a primary disorder of the white matter microarchitecture </plain></SENT>
