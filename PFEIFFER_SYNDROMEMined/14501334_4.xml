<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Frequently, patients with craniofacial syndromes may have associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001155'>hand anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article, we try to answer why certain craniofacial syndromes have associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001155'>hand anomalies</z:hpo> through an examination of the common factors in development and maldevelopment of these two very complex structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In general, we conclude that the common factors responsible for patients with craniofacial syndromes that have associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001155'>hand anomalies</z:hpo> are the common time course of development of these two structures and certain mutations of genes controlling limb and craniofacial development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This article attempts to elucidate the sequence and crucial factors responsible for proper limb growth, as we understand it today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common craniofacial syndromes that include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and upper extremity anomalies are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s, Saethre-Chotzen, Pfeiffer's, and Carpenter's syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As we discuss each of these syndromes, basic principles regarding the surgical correction of the associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001155'>hand anomalies</z:hpo> are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hope that this overview serves to give the pediatrician and the craniofacial specialist general guidelines for what to look for and expect in the hands and upper extremities of children under their care </plain></SENT>
