<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the first mouse model of the syndrome was generated, having the mutation Cys342Tyr in Fgfr2c, equivalent to the most common human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>/Pfeiffer syndrome mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a set of micro-computed tomography (CT) scannings of the skulls of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> mice were analysed with respect to the dysmorphology caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A computational craniofacial atlas was built automatically from the set of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mouse micro-CT volumes using (1) affine and (2) non-rigid image registration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the atlas was deformed to match each subject from the two groups of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of these registrations was measured by a comparison of manually placed landmarks from two different observers and automatically assessed landmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both of the automatic approaches were within the interobserver accuracy for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> specimens, and the non-rigid approach was within the interobserver accuracy for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four linear measurements, skull length, height and width and interorbital distance, were carried out automatically using the two different approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both automatic approaches assessed the skull length, width and height accurately for both groups of mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The non-rigid approach measured the interorbital distance accurately for both groups while the affine approach failed to assess this parameter for both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the full capability of the non-rigid approach, local displacements obtained when registering the non-rigid <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> atlas to a non-rigid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> mouse atlas were determined on the surface of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> atlas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This revealed a 0.6-mm bending in the nasal region and a 0.8-mm shortening of the zygoma, which are similar to characteristics previously reported in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most striking finding of this analysis was an angulation of approximately 0.6 mm of the cranial base, which has not been reported in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Comparing the two different methodologies, it is concluded that the non-rigid approach is the best way to assess linear skull parameters automatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the non-rigid approach is essential when it comes to analysing local, non-linear shape differences </plain></SENT>
