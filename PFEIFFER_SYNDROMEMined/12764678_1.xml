<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The FGFR3-associated coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> syndrome (Muenke <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>) is caused by a point mutation (C749G) on the FGFR3 gene resulting in a Pro250Arg substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To characterize this malformation, the neuro- and viscerocranium were analyzed by axial CT scans of the skull and cephalometric radiographs of up to 13 affected children before and in part after fronto-orbital advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative analysis of the intracranial volume of four patients showed a mean decrease of 3.6%, indicating a compensatory growth pattern of the skull in cases of coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> could be verified by the significant shortening of the skull length of 13.2% on average and by the significant reduction of the anterior cranial base length of maximal 5.9% on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anterior part of the skull was characterized by a significant mean increase of the intercoronal distance of 8.6%, which indicates a compensatory transversal growth in this malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The widened bilateral interorbital and anterior interorbital distances were increased by 7.3 or 9.0%, respectively, confirming a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> typical for this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002007'>frontal bossing</z:hpo>" frequently found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> was characterized by the preoperatively increased sagittal extension of the forehead (about 112.9% above the norm) and by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001254'>increased height</z:mp> of the frontal prominence (about 47.8% above the norm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following surgery, both variables defining the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the forehead were reduced and appeared to be constant throughout the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>Hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the midface described by Muenke et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(1997) was confirmed in the present study only by the significant reduction of the sagittal length of the maxillary base, which was decreased by 6.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In accordance with the current literature, the skull configuration described for Muenke <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> shows similarities with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
