<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In craniofacial surgery, the most common techniques for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> have been either to let the forehead float on the brain or to fix it in an advanced position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since neither of these techniques renders acceptable results with enough consistency, we have developed a different way of addressing the problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In principle, the design of the operation is to restrict upward and transverse growth of the cranium but to allow anterior and posterior expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is accomplished by producing transverse tension across the skull and letting it expand anteriorly by means of a superiorly hinged fronto-orbital flap and posteriorly by an inferiorly based occipital flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To prevent upward expansion at the squamosal sutures when still open, these junctions are bridged with miniplates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This surgical technique has brought definite improvement to the results even in some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a 2-year period, we have treated 14 infants with this technique and followed 10 of them with roentgencephalometry, 3 for more than 1 year, and 4 for more than 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnoses were the following: nonsyndromal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011318'>bicoronal synostosis</z:hpo> (4), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> (7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011318'>bicoronal synostosis</z:hpo> with midline cleft, Saethre-Chotzen, and Antley-Bixler (1 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age of surgery was 6.6 months (range 3 to 16 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no major complications </plain></SENT>
