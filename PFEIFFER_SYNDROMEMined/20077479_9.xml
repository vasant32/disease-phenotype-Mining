<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nearly 100% of individuals diagnosed with AS carry one of two neighboring mutations on Fgfr2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cranial phenotype associated with these two mutations includes coronal suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp>, either unilateral (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011315'>unicoronal synostosis</z:hpo>) or bilateral (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011318'>bicoronal synostosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain dysmorphology associated with AS is thought to be secondary to cranial vault or base alterations, but the variation in brain phenotypes within <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we present novel three-dimensional data on brain phenotypes of inbred mice at postnatal day 0 each carrying one of the two Fgfr2 mutations associated with AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the brain is primarily affected, rather than secondarily responding to skull dysmorphogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our hypothesis is that the skull and brain are both primarily affected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and that shared phenogenetic developmental processes affect both tissues in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
