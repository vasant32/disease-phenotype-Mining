<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The generation of genetic variety by spontaneous mutational events has been the driving force behind evolution--without such mutation our complex human genome could not have evolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, as doctors, we more frequently encounter mutation in the context of human disease, whether in somatic cells as a cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, or in the germline as a cause of inheritable disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these contexts, the processes of mutagenesis are relevant to every field of medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Scientific study of mutational mechanisms has logically been founded in the relatively simple genetic systems of the prokaryotes and such lowly eukaryotes as the fruit-fly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study of human clinical genetics approaches the problem from quite the opposite direction--from that of the most highly evolved genetic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whilst this approach may be dependent less on logical progression and more on phenomenology, it nevertheless provides a complementary avenue for the observation and study of mutational mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genetic research described in this article is firmly rooted in such phenomenology, based as it is on rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, there has been a deluge of molecular discoveries in the field of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This promises improvements in classification, prognostication, pre-natal diagnosis, and perhaps ultimately for potential avenues for cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, exciting as these clinical prospects are, the research presented here has a different focus: it investigates the mechanistic basis underlying the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> mutations, in the hope that such study may lead to insights applicable generally to the field of mutagenesis </plain></SENT>
