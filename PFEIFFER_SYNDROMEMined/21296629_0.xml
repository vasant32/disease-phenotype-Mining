<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In approximately 20% of the cases a deletion of variable size is detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If deletion is large and affects other genes as well as GLI3, a more severe phenotype is expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001466'>contiguous gene syndrome</z:hpo> is a multiple malformation syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of GLI3 and adjacent genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe the case of a newborn female with <z:mp ids='MP_0004083'>polysyndactyly</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> and a 1.5 Mb 7p14.1 microdeletion of paternal origin diagnosed by array-CGH </plain></SENT>
