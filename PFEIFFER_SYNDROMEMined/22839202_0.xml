<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human TWIST1 is a highly conserved member of the regulatory basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TWIST1 forms homo- or heterodimers with E-box proteins, such as E2A (isoforms E12 and E47), MYOD and HAND2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haploinsufficiency germ-line mutations of the twist1 gene in humans are the main cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS)</z:e>, which is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo> and premature fusion of cranial sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the importance of TWIST1 in the regulation of embryonic development and its relationship with SCS, along with the lack of an experimentally solved 3D structure, we performed comparative modeling for the TWIST1 bHLH region arranged into <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> homodimers and heterodimers with E47 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, three mutations that promote DNA binding failure (R118C, S144R and K145E) were studied on the TWIST1 monomer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also explored the behavior of the mutant forms in aqueous solution using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, focusing on the structural changes of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> versus mutant dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The solvent-accessible surface area of the homodimers was smaller on <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> dimers, which indicates that the cleft between the monomers remained more open on the mutant homodimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RMSD and RMSF analyses indicated that mutated dimers presented values that were higher than those for the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For a more careful investigation, the monomer was subdivided into four regions: basic, helix I, loop and helix II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The basic domain presented a higher flexibility in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the parameters that were analyzed, and the mutant dimer basic domains presented values that were higher than the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> dimers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The essential dynamic analysis also indicated a higher collective motion for the basic domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the mutations studied turned the dimers into more unstable structures with a wider cleft, which may be a reason for the loss of DNA binding capacity observed for in vitro circumstances </plain></SENT>
