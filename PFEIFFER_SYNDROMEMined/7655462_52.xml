<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies of mutations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> have shown that the family of fibroblast growth factor receptor genes are extremely important in the correct formation of the skull, and digits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the third immunoglobulin domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), in part of the molecule corresponding to a tissue specific isoform (IIIc), can cause both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and Pfeiffer syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two specific mutations in the linking region between the second and third immunoglobulin domains of FGFR2 occur in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present here mutations associated with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, also in the third immunoglobulin domain but in an upstream exon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This exon is expressed in both tissue isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five different mutations were detected in 11 unrelated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cysteine to phenylalanine change was found in six individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This cysteine forms half of the disulphide bridge maintaining the secondary structure of the immunoglobulin domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first deletion within an FGFR gene is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Together with mutations in exon IIIc these account for 25 mutations out of 40 Crouzon patients studied in our combined series (5) </plain></SENT>
