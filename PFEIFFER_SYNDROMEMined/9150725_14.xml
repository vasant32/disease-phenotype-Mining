<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pfeiffer syndrome is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263661" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skeletal disorder</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> associated with foot and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001155'>hand anomalies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the genes encoding fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 and 2 (FGFR1 and FGFR2) have recently been implicated in the aetiology of such a syndrome, as well as of other craniosynostotic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report a novel missense mutation, a G to C transversion at position 1049 (exon IIIa) of FGFR2, detected in a patient with severe Pfeiffer clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mutation results in the substitution of a cysteine for tryptophan-290 in the third immunoglobulin-like domain and affects both spliceoforms of FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations causing replacement of tryptophan-290 have also been reported previously in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, a similar but clinically distinct craniosynostotic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding confirms the involvement of mutations of FGFR2 exon IIIa in Pfeiffer syndrome, and emphasizes both the extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of the FGFR2 mutations that result in the Pfeiffer phenotype and the perturbations caused by unpaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> in receptor dimerization and transduction of the FGFs signal </plain></SENT>
