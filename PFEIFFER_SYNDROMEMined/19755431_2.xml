<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>Craniosynostosis</z:hpo> can be caused by both genetic and environmental factors, the relative contributions of which vary between patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic mutation or chromosomal abnormality in ∼ 21% of cases, but it is likely that further causative mutations remain to be discovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify a shared signature of genetically determined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> by comparing the expression patterns in three monogenic syndromes with a control group of patients with non-syndromic sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> (no mutation detected) were cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative expression of ∼ 47,000 transcripts was quantified on Affymetrix arrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 435, 45 and 46 transcripts were identified in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, Muenke and Saethre-Chotzen groups, respectively, that differed significantly from the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six of these transcripts were shared between two or more syndromes and, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one instance, showed the same direction of altered expression level compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathway analysis showed over-representation of the shared transcripts in core modules involving cell-to-cell communication and signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individual samples from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> cases could be reliably distinguished from non-syndromic samples based on the gene expression profile, but this was not possible for samples from patients with Muenke and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Common modules of altered gene expression shared by genetically distinct forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the expression profiles cannot currently be used to classify individual patients, this may be overcome by using more sensitive assays and sampling additional tissues </plain></SENT>
