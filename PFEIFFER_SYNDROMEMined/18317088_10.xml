<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The incidence of resynostosis after surgical release of synostotic suture(s) is not well reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors examined cases of nonsyndromic and syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> treated with surgical repair and established the rate of reoperation for <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts were retrieved from 119 consecutive patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>: 62 percent were boys, and 11 percent were treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, n = 2; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, n = 4; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, n = 5; and other, n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (6.7 percent) underwent surgery for resynostosis [nonsyndromic, six of 106 (5.7 percent); syndromic, two of 13 (15.4 percent)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine patients (66.4 percent) underwent primary surgery before 1 year of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis by age at primary operation yielded significantly lower resynostosis rates (p &lt; 0.02) when patients younger than 1 year [two of 79 resynostosis cases (2.5 percent)] were compared with those older than 1 year [six of 40 resynostosis cases (15 percent)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further stratifications of age at initial operation did not yield significance for resynostosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four of eight patients who resynostosed had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e>, as indicated by lumbar puncture following the primary operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A trend of increasing mean length of hospital stay, estimated blood loss, and operative time in the patients who eventually resynostosed was observed (data not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Resynostosis rates were higher in syndromic than in nonsyndromic children for whom a single suture was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Analysis of age at primary operation showed an increase in resynostosis when the primary operation occurred after age 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> following primary surgery may suggest recurrence </plain></SENT>
