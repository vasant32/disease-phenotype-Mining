<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: DNA from peripheral blood was examined in 4 families with Pfeiffer syndrome by SSCP-sequence analyses and PCR-restriction enzyme digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The authors found the mutations of FGFR2 gene in two families, an A to G transition in the 3' acceptor splice site of intron 8 in a family, and Asp321 Ala substitution in exon 9 in another family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the mutation in exon 5 of FGFR1 gene (Pro252Arg) was found in a family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings reveal the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of Pfeiffer syndrome and can help one understand the molecular mechanism of the disease </plain></SENT>
