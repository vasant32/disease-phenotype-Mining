<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It results from abnormal differentiation or proliferation of cells within the osteogenic fronts of growing calvarial bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, research has focused on animal models and in vitro organ and tissue culture to determine the molecular mechanisms controlling calvarial suture morphogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we test a new, in vivo-in vitro approach based on the hypothesis that calvarial suture cells passaged in minimal medium exhibit a stable gene expression profile similar to undifferentiated osteoblastic cells that can provide a benchmark for comparison with in vivo expression of differentiated tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that tissue-specific expression is lost after the first passage and, using cDNA microarrays, compare expression between fused suture tissue from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> patients and in vitro de-differentiated explant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A large number of differentially expressed genes were identified, including novel genes WIF1, LEF1, SATB2, RARRES1, DEFA1, DMP1, PTPRZ1, and PTPRC, as well as those commonly associated with human suture morphogenesis, e.g., FGF2, MSX2, and BMP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two differentially expressed genes, WIF1 and FGF2, were further examined in an in vivo-in vivo comparison between unfused and prematurely fused tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same pattern of differential expression was observed in each case, further validating the ability of our in vivo-in vitro approach to identify genes involved in in vivo human calvarial tissue differentiation </plain></SENT>
