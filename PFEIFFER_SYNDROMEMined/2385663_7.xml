<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were found to have a combination of upper and lower abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influence of lower pathology was greater in the infants, and the influence of upper airway, specifically pharyngeal, was greater in the adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison between preoperative and postoperative polysomnography revealed little improvement with standard craniofacial advancements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, three patients are described who succumbed to pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> despite tracheostomy </plain></SENT>
