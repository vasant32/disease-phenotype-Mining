<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> deformity in a patient with hypochondroplasia, a disorder which has not been previously associated with this anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypochondroplasia is a bone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>Cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> is a trilobar skull deformity which is etiologically and genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and occurs in association with a number of disorders which result from mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our patient demonstrated one of the common FGFR3 mutations identified in hypochondroplasia, a C-to-A change at nucleotide 1620 (C1620A) in the tyrosine kinase domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> deformity appears to represent an example of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003828'>variable expressivity</z:hpo> in hypochondroplasia and suggests that additional factors other than a specific mutation can modify the phenotype in this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, identification of another FGFR mutation associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> further illustrates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> of this anomaly </plain></SENT>
