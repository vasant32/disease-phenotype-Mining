<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six children aged 1-18 years and suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000243'>trigonocephaly</z:hpo>, Morbus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and Morbus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo> underwent a reconstructive procedure of the skull and midface, mostly frontal advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The different part of skull have been fixed by biodegradable implants made of polylactate acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another two infants, one with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001362'>skull defect</z:hpo> after removal of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephalocele</z:hpo> and the other for reconstruction of the skull after open cerebral injury and consecutive osteoclastic trepanation, have been treated with skull splitting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two halves of the skull have been fixed by biodegradable material too </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The follow-up of these 8 children now is from 2-20 months (medium 10 1/2 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the aesthetic point of view as well as from radiological and clinical signs we judge the result as good as with conventional materials, for example wire loops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No material had to be removed and CT scans show a fully resorption of the implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present paper shows the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative evolution </plain></SENT>
