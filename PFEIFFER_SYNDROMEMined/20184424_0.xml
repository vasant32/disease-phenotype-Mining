<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Abstract Objective: To describe the clinical, speech, hearing, and imaging findings in three members of a Brazilian family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS)</z:e> who presented some unusual characteristics within the spectrum of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Design: Clinical evaluation was performed by a multidisciplinary team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding region of the TWIST1 gene, routine and electrophysiological hearing evaluation, speech evaluation, and imaging studies through computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: TWIST1 gene analysis revealed a Pro136His mutation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hearing evaluation showed peripherial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000410'>mixed hearing loss</z:hpo> in two of the patients, one of them with severe unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0008551'>microtia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography scan showed structural middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000598'>ear anomalies</z:hpo>, and MRI showed distortion of the skull contour as well as some of the brain structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: We report a previously undescribed TWIST1 gene mutation in patients with SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that indicates hearing loss (conductive and mixed) can be related both with middle ear (<z:hpo ids='HP_0008551'>microtia</z:hpo>, high jugular bulb, and enlarged vestibules) as well as with brain stem anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here we discuss the relationship between the gene mutation and the clinical, imaging, speech, and hearing findings </plain></SENT>
