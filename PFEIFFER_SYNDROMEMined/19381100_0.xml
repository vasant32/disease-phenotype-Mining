<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is because common skeletal landmarks move from their original position, making standard cephalometries completely useless </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To solve this problem, some authors proposed evaluations based on 2- and 3-dimensional computed tomographies, but the biologic risk and the economic outcome do not consent to repeat this kind of examination too often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the authors propose a new cephalometric model based on the evaluation of facial skeletal landmarks on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32590">BaS</z:chebi> axis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method, named <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32590">BaS</z:chebi> analysis, might be useful in evaluating improvements of the splanchnocranium in patients who underwent craniofacial advancement </plain></SENT>
