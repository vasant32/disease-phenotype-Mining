<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical charts from 2194 children treated at the Craniofacial Unit of Necker Enfants Malades between 1995 and 2008 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among them, 293 were affected by a syndromic faciocraniosynostosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The management of cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> treated using ETV was examined and analyzed with regard to successes and failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six children with associated progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> were identified, and 11 (8 boys, 3 girls) had undergone an ETV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were affected by a faciocraniosynostosis (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> in 5, Pfeiffer syndrome in 3, and unclassifiable in 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A descent of the cerebellar tonsils was found in 5 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7 children the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was controlled by an ETV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 4 cases a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was also needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The delay between the 2 surgeries ranged from 1 week to 6 months in these 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 11 months to 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Performing an ETV may facilitate control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> associated with faciocraniosynostosis in select cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, because of the relatively high failure rate of this procedure, a close clinical and radiological monitoring of these children is mandatory </plain></SENT>
