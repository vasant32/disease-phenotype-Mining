<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Distraction osteogenesis has some advantages, such as less hazardous complications, less <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, and fewer bone defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has not been fully accepted yet because of a unidirectional expansion along the distraction device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because cranial expansion is limited by scalp tension and soft-tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo>, undercorrection of the cranium and relapse of the vault deformities have occasionally been seen on long-term follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients also had so much bone defect that the donor bone was inadequate for immediate revisions, and dissection under the scalp was complicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors used distraction osteogenesis to treat 12 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients were syndromic (two cases of Pfeiffer's syndrome, two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's disease</z:e>, and one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e>), and seven were nonsyndromic (four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo>, two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000268'>scaphocephaly</z:hpo>, and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After only unidirectional expansion without vertical reduction, the shape of the cranium was satisfactorily improved, which might have been an illusion caused by the relative reduction attributed to the elongation by the distraction osteogenesis and, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo>, alteration of the patient's head position resulting from inclination of the facial plane by forehead advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000268'>scaphocephaly</z:hpo>, the unique deformity in the occipital and frontal regions remained after simple distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distraction osteogenesis should be applied for a narrow cranium because the bone defect and scalp closure could pose problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Radical reshaping should be used in cases of sufficient donor bone and scalp closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although additional surgery is unavoidable for device removal, minor revisions can be performed for revision of the irregularity at that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Except for prolonged treatment, based on minimally invasive operations, distraction cranioplasty might be applied extensively in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
