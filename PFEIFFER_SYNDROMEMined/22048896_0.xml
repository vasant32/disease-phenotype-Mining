<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the periosteum is an important cell source for bone remodeling, its role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> remains poorly characterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that periosteal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts from AS patients have abnormal <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotypes</z:mp> that contribute to the recurrent fusion of the coronal sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MSCs and fibroblasts were obtained from the periostea of 3 AS patients (S252W) and 3 control individuals (WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, S252W mutation had opposite effects on different cell types: S252W MSCs proliferated less than WT MSCs, while S252W fibroblasts proliferated more than WT fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under restrictive media conditions, only S252W fibroblasts showed enhanced migration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of S252W mutation increased in vitro and in vivo osteogenic differentiation in both studied cell types, though the difference compared to WT cells was more pronounced in S252W fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This osteogenic differentiation was reversed through inhibition of JNK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that S252W fibroblasts can induce osteogenic differentiation in periosteal MSCs but not in MSCs from another tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MSCs and fibroblasts responded differently to the pathogenic effects of the FGFR2(S252W) mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose that cells from the periosteum have a more important role in the premature fusion of cranial sutures than previously thought and that molecules in JNK pathway are strong candidates for the treatment of AS patients </plain></SENT>
