<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors are responsible for the density, length, color and texture of hair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Heredity disorders can affect either hair alone, hair and other ectodermal structures, or can be pansystemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper considers <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> heredity disorders which affect human hair growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These disorders are divided into three categories: 1) the dysmorphic syndromes; 2) the modifier gene abnormalities and 3) the single major gene abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disorders in these categories are listed, along with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo>, cause, hair phenotype and the extent of involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The utilitarian function of the study of human hair growth is illustrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insight into problems of differentiation can be most rapidly expanded using this approach </plain></SENT>
