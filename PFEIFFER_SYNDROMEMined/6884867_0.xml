<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The miniplate osteosynthesis stabilizes the skeletal segments in their new position and function so securely that intermaxillary fixation is no longer necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This modality of internal fixation is applicable even in small children and infants allowing total osteotomy and mobilisation of the cranium and the facial skeleton at this early age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The miniplates may also prevent restenosis after radical stripping of prematurely closed sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plates and screws are usually removed 6 to 12 months later through small stab incisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The craniofacial surgery groups in Munich and Innsbruck have successfully applied this form of fixation in 10 selected children with severe malformations, their age ranging from 3 months to 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technique and results are demonstrated in appropriate examples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pros and cons of the miniplate osteosynthesis versus other methods of fixation are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a period of nearly 3 years (1980-1982) no complications have been observed </plain></SENT>
