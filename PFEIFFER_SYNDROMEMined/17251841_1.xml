<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sinus pericranii is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282607" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">vascular tumor</z:e> of the head having communication with the dural venous system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> enlarges with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> when the patient is in the lateral recumbent position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since Stromeyer used the term "sinus pericranii" in his report in 1850, approximately 170 cases have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, relatively few cases of sinus pericranii have been reported in association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> or by plastic surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report seven cases of sinus pericranii associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000263'>oxycephaly</z:hpo>, and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000243'>trigonocephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sites of occurrence were the parietal region in six patients and the frontal region in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In either type of case, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was clinically a soft subcutaneous mass of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> were its disappearance when the patient was in a sitting position and its appearance when the patient was in a recumbent position or crying </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients were preoperatively diagnosed with sinus pericranii from imaging test findings, such as from magnetic resonance imaging and aforementioned clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, treatment for sinus pericranii was performed during the surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For patients with lesions in either site, we did not perform craniotomy, and we used a minimally invasive method of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> excision and resection of the sites of communication using electrocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Perioperatively, heavy <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was not observed, and, postoperatively, no recurrence has been observed in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examine the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of sinus pericranii, in particular for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
