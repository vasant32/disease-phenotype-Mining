<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AS-type FGFR2 molecules exert a gain-of-function effect in a ligand-dependent manner, but the causative FGFs and their relative contribution to each of the abnormalities observed in AS remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have generated mice that harbour an AS mutation but are deficient in or heterozygous for Fgf10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genetic knockdown of Fgf10 can rescue the skeletal as well as some of the visceral defects observed in this AS model, and restore a near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of FgfR2 signaling involving an apparent switch between ERK(p44/p42) and p38 phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, it can also yield de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and blind colon in a subset of the compound mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings strongly suggest that Fgf10 contributes to AS-like pathologies and highlight a complexity of Fgf10 function in different tissues </plain></SENT>
