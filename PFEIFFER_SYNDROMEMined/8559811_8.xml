<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and 39 patients with Pfeiffer syndrome were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The morbidity in 5 of the 106 patients (4.7 percent) was felt to be directly related to persistently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">elevated intracranial pressure</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These included 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, 1 due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270679" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem herniation</z:e> after an elective subcranial Le Fort III advancement and 1 following removal of a lumboperitoneal shunt during the surgical release of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 complications included bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> detected 3.5 years after cranial vault remodeling in 1 patient and venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> detected during elevation of the bicoronal flap in 2 patients, resulting in delay of a planned Le Fort III advancement </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical guidelines are proposed by which these patients should be evaluated beyond infancy in a regular fashion so as to reduce morbidity from unrecognized elevations in intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
