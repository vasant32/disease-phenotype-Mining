<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional vault remodeling techniques are limited by scalp forces and may relapse with supine positioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of posterior vault distraction and evaluate perioperative variables compared with conventional methods in syndromic children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of consecutive children who underwent posterior vault expansion using distraction osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information was compiled regarding demographics, perioperative details, distraction protocol, and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight children were identified, two boys and six girls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Saethre-Chotzen, and Pfeiffer syndromes were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo> was present in two children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The posterior distraction procedure was undertaken at a mean of 21 months (range, 5 to 36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean operative time was 3.8 hours (range, 2.6 to 5 hours), blood loss averaged 487 ml (range, 300 to 2000 ml), and hospital stay was 3.25 days (range, 2 to 4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A latency period of 72 hours and rate of 2/3 mm/day was used in three patients, and 1 mm/day was used in five children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mean advancement was 23 mm (range, 19 to 32 mm) and consolidation was 77 days (range, 42 to 100 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One child experienced fracture of distraction arms during the activation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 278 days (range, 90 to 548 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that posterior vault distraction is a viable technique with a favorable perioperative profile compared with conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Posterior distraction can be the initial strategy with which to address intracranial pressure, allowing delay of definitive frontoorbital advancement until later in childhood </plain></SENT>
