<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and the management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with complex syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> at Chang Gung Craniofacial Center were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Criteria for inclusion of patients were the presence of adequate follow-up and documentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 patients were included, of whom 13 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> and 27 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms and signs related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> and its treatment were evaluated carefully, and were verified further by telephone inquiry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The status of the airway was categorized into one of three groups: no obstruction; mild obstruction, for which positioning and medical treatment were needed; and severe obstruction, for which surgical intervention was needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 24 patients (60%) did not have <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e>, 11 patients (27.5%) had mild obstruction, and 5 patients (12.5%) had severe obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the distribution of airway status between patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Causes for the 5 patients with severe obstruction were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo>, lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e>, tonsillar and adenoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000453'>choanal atresia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tracheostomy was performed to control airway in 3 patients, and 1 patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Midface anterior distraction helped to decannulate 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> was observed in 40% of patients with severe craniosynostotic syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most of them could be managed successfully with conservative or medical treatment, and surgical intervention should be considered on the basis of each patient's individual condition </plain></SENT>
