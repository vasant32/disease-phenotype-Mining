<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To identify perioperative complications in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, craniofacial anomalies, and severe symmetrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> (cutaneous and bony fusion) of the hands and feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children with this syndrome require <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38869">general anesthetics</z:chebi> for a number of different operations and procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our institution has records of 71 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of their <z:chebi fb="28" ids="38869">general anesthetic</z:chebi> records was undertaken, and the incidence of perioperative complications was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case note review was performed on 61 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> over a 14-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 509 general <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> administered to these children during this period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were a total of 31 perioperative respiratory complications occurring in 21 patients (6.1% of the total cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of these complications were supraglottic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> (4.5% of total cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found there to be a low incidence of major perioperative major complications in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, a significant proportion of these children have obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoea</z:hpo> and may develop supraglottic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> on induction and emergence from anesthesia due to the associated mid-face anatomical abnormalities </plain></SENT>
