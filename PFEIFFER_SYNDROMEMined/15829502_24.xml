<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which Twist haploinsufficiency may alter osteoblast differentiation are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (Fgfr2) in the <z:mp ids='MP_0008395'>abnormal osteoblast differentiation</z:mp> in SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cranial osteoblasts from an SCS patient with a Y103X mutation inducing deletion of the Twist bHLH domain showed decreased Fgfr2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels associated with decreased expression of Runx2, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin (OC), markers of differentiated osteoblasts, compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfection with Twist or Runx2 expression vectors, but not with Runx2 mutant which impairs DNA binding, restored Fgfr2, Runx2, BSP and OC expression in Twist mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EMSA analysis of mutant osteoblast nuclear extracts showed reduced Runx2 binding to a target OSE2 site in the Fgfr2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ChIP analyses showed that both Twist and Runx2 in mutant osteoblast nuclear extracts bind to a specific region in the Fgfr2 promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly, forced expression of Fgfr2 restored Runx2 and osteoblast marker genes, whereas a dominant-negative Fgfr2 further decreased Runx2 and downstream genes in Twist mutant osteoblasts, indicating that alteration of Fgfr2 results in downregulation of osteoblast genes in Twist mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that Twist haploinsufficiency downregulates Fgfr2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, which in turn reduces Runx2 and downstream osteoblast-specific genes in human calvarial osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This provides genetic and biochemical evidence for a role of Fgfr2 in the altered osteoblast phenotype induced by Twist haploinsufficiency in the SCS </plain></SENT>
