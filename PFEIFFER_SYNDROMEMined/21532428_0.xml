<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hearing loss has been described in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> but is poorly documented in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the audiologic and otologic records of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> to define the incidence, type, and extent of hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only patients with documented audiologic examinations were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss was categorized by American Speech-Language-Hearing Association guidelines (i.e., mild, 26 to 40 dB; moderate, 41 to 55 dB; moderate/severe, 56 to 70 dB; severe, 71 to 90 dB; and profound, &gt;90 dB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age at initial audiologic evaluation was 6.7 years (range, 0.7 to 24.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (59 percent) had at least one abnormal audiogram; in 15 patients, the deficit was mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five cases resolved and, thus, had been mischaracterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> on at least one examination; follow-up testing in four patients revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients had unspecified hearing loss by sound field method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000410'>mixed hearing loss</z:hpo> on consecutive audiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (72 percent) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hearing on their last audiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> had hearing loss at some point during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This was typically mild and correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000370'>middle ear abnormality</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271468" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">eustachian tube dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Usually, the hearing deficit resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early mischaracterization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000410'>mixed hearing loss</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> as <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> was common </plain></SENT>
