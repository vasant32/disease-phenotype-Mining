<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this retrospective clinical outcome study was to evaluate a new technique for distracting the Le Fort III procedure and to compare its results in growing children with those of the standard Le Fort III osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The records of 22 children were reviewed; 10 patients (mean age, 6.5 years) underwent a standard Le Fort III procedure, and 12 patients (mean age, 7.5 years) underwent a Le Fort III distraction procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distraction group included two separate techniques, bilateral buried distraction (n = 2) and halo distraction (n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and 2- to 3-month postoperative cephalograms were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average horizontal advancement achieved in the standard Le Fort III group was 6 mm, compared with 19 mm of advancement in the distraction group (p &lt;/= 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complications were evenly distributed between the two groups (one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and one tracheostomy in each group), and the lengths of hospitalization were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No documented improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> was identified in the standard Le Fort III group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in the distraction group two patients experienced normalization of sleep studies postoperatively as measured by respiratory disturbance index, and two patients underwent successful decannulation of tracheotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For aesthetic reasons, halo distraction was preferred over bilateral buried distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With halo distraction the vector of traction is focused in the facial midline, which helps to reposition the concave midface and to provide a more convex facial profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In growing children, the ideal vector for distraction is determined by the malar position and not by dental occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The amount of overcorrection can be calculated from tables of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anthropologic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On this preliminary review, it was concluded that the use of halo distraction, in combination with a modified Le Fort III osteotomy, provided a significantly further forward-positioned midface and seemed to offer a better correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo> than did the standard Le Fort III osteotomy </plain></SENT>
