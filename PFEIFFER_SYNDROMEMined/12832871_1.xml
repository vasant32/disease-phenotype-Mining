<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is a relatively uncommon condition that is instantly recognizable on the basis of the pan-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactylies</z:hpo> involving both the hands and feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For more than 10 years, the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> hand and foot anomalies was approached in a comprehensive manner, with attempts to maximize the final results and minimize the total number of operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numerous conventions were abandoned in the development of this approach, with the introduction of some new methodologies, including (1) release of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 fingers, and toes, in only two operations, (2) elimination of routine digital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath>, (3) abandonment of the zigzag incision in favor of straight-line release, (4) substitution of equal-length anterior and posterior flaps for the long dorsal web space lining flap, (5) leaving of small areas of exposed bone without vascularized tissue coverage, and (6) performance of midphalangeal osteotomies, among older children, to improve hand function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> have been treated at the author's center since 1990, and 43 underwent surgical treatment of their hands and feet by a single surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment can be separated into two phases, early (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> releases) and late (functional osteotomies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of those 43 patients were treated at the author's center from birth (type I, 11 patients; type II, two patients; type III, four patients), and 10 fingers and 10 toes were achieved for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in two operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No digital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath> were performed for any of the 43 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, four of 26 patients (15 percent) not treated at the author's center from birth had undergone at least one digital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> before coming to the center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of those 26 patients required a two-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> release to accomplish the separation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 fingers and toes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Aside from the patients who had previously undergone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other patients successfully achieved 10 fingers and toes, except for one patient (38 of 39 patients, 97 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average operative time for the first-stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> release of the hands and feet was 4 hours 11 minutes (range, 185 to 300 minutes), and that for the second stage was 3 hours 49 minutes (range, 160 to 300 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight hands were treated with functional osteotomies, which involved permanent angulation of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008730'>fused phalanges</z:mp> at the proximal interphalangeal level, to create a "position of function" and provide pulp-to-pulp pinch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, targeted osteotomies of the feet were performed for many of these patients, to decrease pain with walking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no major complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Minor complications included one reexploration because of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, early in the series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were 13 incomplete secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactylies</z:hpo> that required a subsequent operative release (10 spaces treated at the author's center and three treated elsewhere), of a total of 342 spaces (3 percent author incidence) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no scar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> or functional limitations that required release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This distinctive protocol seemed to result in improved functional outcomes, with a reduction in the total number of operative procedures </plain></SENT>
