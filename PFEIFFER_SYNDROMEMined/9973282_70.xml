<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed 260 unrelated patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 of whom have missense mutations in exon 7, which affect a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46761">dipeptide</z:chebi> in the linker region between the second and third immunoglobulin-like domains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence, the molecular mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is exquisitely specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FGFR2 mutations in the remaining two patients are distinct in position and nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, each patient harbors an Alu-element insertion of approximately 360 bp, in one case just upstream of exon 9 and in the other case within exon 9 itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The insertions are likely to be pathological, because they have arisen de novo; in both cases this occurred on the paternal chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FGFR2 is present in alternatively spliced isoforms characterized by either the IIIb (exon 8) or IIIc (exon 9) domains (keratinocyte growth-factor receptor [KGFR] and bacterially expressed kinase, respectively), which are differentially expressed in mouse limbs on embryonic day 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Splicing of exon 9 was examined in <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> extracted from fibroblasts and keratinocytes from one patient with an Alu insertion and two patients with Pfeiffer syndrome who had nucleotide substitutions of the exon 9 acceptor splice site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ectopic expression of KGFR in the fibroblast lines correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This provides the first genetic evidence that signaling through KGFR causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
