<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This bias, usually attributed to the accumulation of replication errors or inefficient repair processes, has been difficult to study directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a sensitive method to quantify substitutions at nucleotide 755 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene in sperm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although substitution levels increase with age, we show that even high levels originate from infrequent mutational events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We propose that these FGFR2 mutations, although harmful to embryonic development, are paradoxically enriched because they confer a selective advantage to the spermatogonial cells in which they arise </plain></SENT>
