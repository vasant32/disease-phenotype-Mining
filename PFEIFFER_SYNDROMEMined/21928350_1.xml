<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) mutations are a well-known cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many syndromes that comprise <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, and Pfeiffer syndrome, have one of the phenotypes that have been reported in FGFR2 mutant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FGFRs have been reported in four types (FGFR1-4), and upon binding with FGF ligands, signal transduction occurs inside of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Activated FGFR stimulates an osteogenic master transcription factor, Runx2, through the MAP kinase and PKC pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We obtained a genetic analysis of six Korean patients who have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> as a phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients had at least one mutation in the FGFR2 gene; five of those mutations have already been reported elsewhere, while one mutation is novel and was hypothesized to lead to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, we reported and functionally analyzed a novel mutation of the FGFR2 gene found in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> patient, E731K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mutation is in the 2nd tyrosine kinase domain in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mutation caused an enhanced phosphorylation of the FGFR2(E731K) and ERK-MAP kinase, the stimulation of transcriptional activity of Runx2, and consequently, the enhancement of osteogenic marker gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the substitution of E731K in FGFR2 is a novel mutation that resulted in a constitutive activation of the receptor and ultimately resulted in premature suture obliteration </plain></SENT>
