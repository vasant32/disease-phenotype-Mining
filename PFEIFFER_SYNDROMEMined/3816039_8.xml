<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the asymmetric synostoses, operative intervention should be carried out in infancy or early childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the unilateral approach is our preferred method, the bilateral approach can yield equally satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgeons should, therefore, familiarize themselves with both methods and individualize for the given deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mild symmetric (upper face) synostoses are best managed in infancy or early childhood, utilizing bilateral orbital advancement with the expectation that the need for additional major surgery will be at worst 50 per cent and likely significantly less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For moderate to severe synostoses, delaying major intervention to later childhood or adolescence maximizes the chance of obtaining a satisfactory result by a single procedure, either an extended LeFort III or monoblock advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Individualization of each case is essential, and the need for brain and eye protection or the psychologic needs of the patient may dictate a modification of the treatment guidelines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients and parents must be aware that growth and development subsequent to surgery is not entirely predictable, and there may be a need for a second major intervention at a subsequent time, despite these established guidelines </plain></SENT>
