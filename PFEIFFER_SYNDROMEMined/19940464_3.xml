<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The skull is usually hyperacrobrachycephalic, whereas frank cloverleafing, as a clinically obvious trilobed skull deformity, is rarely seen in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a rare case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo> deformity, prenatally diagnosed at 26weeks' gestation in which the sonographic features of a characteristic trilobed skull, abnormal biparietal diameter and head circumference, as well as malformations of the upper and lower extremities led to the diagnosis, confirmed by prenatal fibroblast growth factor receptor type 2 mutation analysis and fetal magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genetic evaluation revealed a p.P253R mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor type 2 consisting in a transversion C&gt;G at nucleotide 758 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We discuss the relevant prenatal morphologic and genetic findings of this patient and review previously published cases </plain></SENT>
