<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to use the genotypic diagnosis of the authors' series of patients with TWIST1-confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> to describe their natural history and long-term surgical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with TWIST1-confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> (n = 22) over 23 years (1985 to 2008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their phenotype, need for primary cranial vault remodeling surgery, and subsequent need for reoperation were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Genetic records were reviewed to identify each patient's TWIST1 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were nine female patients and 13 male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten had bicoronal (45 percent), six had unicoronal (27 percent), and four had multisuture (18 percent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One had metopic and another had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004442'>sagittal craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average follow-up was 7.6 years (range, birth to 19.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (77 percent) underwent initial cranial vault remodeling and 10 (59 percent) required repeat intracranial vault remodeling (Whitaker class IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient required major reoperation with bone grafting (Whitaker class III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients needed minor revision procedures (Whitaker class II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three patients needed no further intervention (Whitaker class I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The locations of the TWIST1 gene mutations in this study did not correlate to a specific surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TWIST1-confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and manifests as either mild or severe craniofacial deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our patients with TWIST1-confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> had a reoperation rate of 65 percent for Whitaker class III and IV surgical outcome, and 59 percent required a secondary intracranial procedure for recurrent supraorbital retrusion </plain></SENT>
