<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by mutations in the TWIST gene encoding a basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report on the identification of a novel mutation affecting a highly conserved residue of the basic domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike nonsense and missense mutations lying within helices, this mutation does not affect protein stability or heterodimerisation of TWIST with its partner E12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, it does abolish TWIST binding capacity to a target E-box as efficiently as two missense mutations in the loop-helix II junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, elongation of the loop through a 7 amino acid insertion appears not to hamper binding to the DNA target </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that loss of TWIST protein function in Saethre-Chotzen patients can occur at three different levels, namely protein stability, dimerisation, and DNA binding and that the loop-helix II junction is essential for effective protein-DNA interaction </plain></SENT>
