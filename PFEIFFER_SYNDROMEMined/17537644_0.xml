<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present paper investigated cellular mechanisms underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> phenotype, by analyzing the effects of FGF2 in primary cultures of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> periosteal fibroblasts carrying the FGFR2 Pro253Arg mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FGF2 administration significantly decreased extracellular matrix production in mutant cells by stimulating degradative enzymatic activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene expression analysis revealed that decorin and biglycan, two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycans</z:chebi> involved in collagen fibrillogenesis, were more expressed in mutant cells and down-regulated by FGF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FGF2 receptor binding showed little differences in high affinity receptor counts between mutant and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> cells, while we showed for the first time that low affinity receptors are significantly fewer in mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, where both high and low affinity receptor counts were up-regulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The different mutation and low affinity receptor regulation in mutant receptors support the hypothesis that the impact on the activity of the ligand-receptor complex could allow distinct modes of FGF2 activation in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndromes</z:e>, which interfere with the FGFR2 signalling cascade </plain></SENT>
