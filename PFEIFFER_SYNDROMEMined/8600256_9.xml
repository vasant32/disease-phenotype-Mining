<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four syndrome patients had computed tomography (CT) scans done presurgically, and one of these patients was additionally scanned postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SL models and three-dimensional (3D) CT image reconstructions were produced from the CT data, and linear measurements were compared between the two modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases showed mean differences between measurements with 3D-CT and SL models of -0.3 to 0.8 mm, except on the CT scans with a gantry tilt (-1.7 mm) and the brachycephalic patient in whom larger deviations were demonstrated (-9.5 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate that the accuracy of the SL technique is not always sufficient, necessitating additional validation studies before it can be recommended for routine clinical use </plain></SENT>
