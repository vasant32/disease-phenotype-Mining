<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of faciocraniosynostosis is a complex problem that includes both function and aesthetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment goals are to prevent further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorders</z:e> and to correct the morphologic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-six patients with faciocraniosynostosis (mean age, 5.2 years) were evaluated prospectively after frontofacial monobloc advancement and quadruple internal distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four distractors were used in combination with a frontofacial monobloc advancement osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications and advancement were evaluated clinically and radiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respiratory status was evaluated by polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relapse was evaluated by comparing results at the time of distractor removal to 6-month values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Distraction was completed in 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients (80 percent) completed their distraction uneventfully in the initial period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In seven patients, a problem related to the distraction devices required revision surgery, and subsequently six of them completed the distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient died the day after surgery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> before distraction was begun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The exorbitism was corrected clinically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom distraction was completed (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A class I occlusal relationship was obtained in 28 of 35 patients (80 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo> was present, it was corrected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two cases (14 of 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A septic frontal <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> occurred in one patient 2 months after distraction was completed (frontal bone loss in one of 35 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Reossification at time of distractor removal was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Relapse has been observed predominantly at the occlusal level (six of 35) and more frequently in Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Internal distraction allows for early correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo> and exorbitism of faciocraniosynostosis, and limits the major risks of frontofacial monobloc advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Previous operations performed before the frontofacial monobloc advancement increased its morbidity </plain></SENT>
