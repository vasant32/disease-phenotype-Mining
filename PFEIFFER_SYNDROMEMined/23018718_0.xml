<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the life situation of adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> born before 1990 were identified in the GÃ¶teborg craniofacial registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors used a questionnaire mainly dealing with education, employment, social relations, and quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A matched control group was created for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of the patients had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of the remaining patients answered the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The level of education was lower in patients than in controls (p = 0.007), but there was no significant difference in the extent of employment between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference in housing was significant (p &lt; 0.001) and the majority of patients lived with their parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were less often married (p &lt; 0.001), had fewer friends (p &lt; 0.001), and had less experience with sexual relationships (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The somatic health was lower in patients [e.g., they had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0260662" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hearing problems</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001) and more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (p = 0.005)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Depressive mood periods were more common in patients (p &lt; 0.001), but there was no difference between the groups regarding a generally positive attitude toward life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> manage relatively well in adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy in social relations between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> patients and the healthy control group indicates that further improvement of the treatment is desirable </plain></SENT>
