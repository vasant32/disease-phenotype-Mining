<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen status post Le Fort III osteotomy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>'s patients with pre- and postoperative lateral cephalograms were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cephalograms were traced, and linear and angular measurements were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postoperative data were compared using a Student's paired t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation between changes in the nasopharyngeal airway and its surrounding skeletal structures was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Finally, the study subjects were divided into two groups--<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>'s--and preoperative measurements from each group were compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> data by a Student's paired t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement in the nasopharyngeal airway followed Le Fort III advancement, with changes in both hard and soft tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no change in the pharyngeal airway, even though a decrease might be predicted because of the clockwise rotation of the mandible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the impairment in the nasopharyngeal airway differed between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that, for the purpose of airway improvement, the midface should be mainly advanced in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e> individual, whereas the downward component of the movement should be predominant in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> individual </plain></SENT>
