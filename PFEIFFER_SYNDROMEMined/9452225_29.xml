<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: A retrospective study of 1727 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> was undertaken to determine the interrelationship between abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups: nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011327'>occipital plagiocephaly</z:hpo> without suture <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> and cases of shunt-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients (1297) were treated surgically for their cranial deformity; 95% of these patients had a postoperative follow-up review period lasting 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiographic charts covering the time from presentation through the follow-up period were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal intracranial CSF hydrodynamics was found in 8.1% of the patients (3.4% of whom had received shunts and 4.5% of whom had not) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three types of CSF hydrodynamic disturbance were observed: progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> with ventricular dilation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventriculomegaly</z:hpo>, and dilation of the subarachnoid spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>Hydrocephalus</z:hpo> occurred much more frequently in patients with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> (12.1%) than in those with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> (0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In fact, patients with kleeblattsch√§del exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> as a constant feature and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e> were far more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> than those with other syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e>, ventricular dilation occurred very frequently, but it was almost always <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In most cases of syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, venous sinus obstruction and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their role in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
