<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Despite the importance of mutation in genetics, there are virtually no experimental data on the occurrence of specific nucleotide substitutions in human gametes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C&gt;G transversions at position 755 of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>; this mutation, encoding the gain-of-function substitution Ser252Trp, occurs with a birth rate elevated 200- to 800-fold above background and originates exclusively from the unaffected father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated high levels of both 755C&gt;G and 755C&gt;T FGFR2 mutations in human sperm and proposed that these particular mutations are enriched because the encoded proteins confer a selective advantage to spermatogonial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we examine three corollaries of this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, we show that mutation levels at the adjacent FGFR2 <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> 752-754 are low, excluding any general increase in local mutation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, we present three instances of double-nucleotide changes involving 755C, expected to be extremely rare as chance events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of these double-nucleotide substitutions are shown, either by assessment of the pedigree or by direct analysis of sperm, to have arisen in sequential steps; the third (encoding Ser252Tyr) was predicted from structural considerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, we demonstrate that both major alternative spliceforms of FGFR2 (Fgfr2b and Fgfr2c) are expressed in rat spermatogonial stem cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these observations show that specific FGFR2 mutations attain high levels in sperm because they encode proteins with gain-of-function properties, favoring clonal expansion of mutant spermatogonial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among FGFR2 mutations, those causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> may be especially prevalent because they enhance signaling by FGF ligands specific for each of the major expressed isoforms </plain></SENT>
