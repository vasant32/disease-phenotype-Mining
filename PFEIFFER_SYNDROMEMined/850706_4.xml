<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A detailed examination of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillborn</z:hpo> fetus with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> showed several unexpected findings, which prompted a reevaluation of the heretofore generally accepted hypotheses regarding the cause of the dysmorphic craniofacial features in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(1) The characteristic clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> were present at 24 to 26 weeks of gestation, and presumably much earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) However, there was no evidence, clinical or histological, of premature fusion of any of the cranial sutures or basilar synchondroses in this fetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From our observations, and from a critical review of the literature, we conclude that the characteristic craniofacial malformations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> are not caused by premature fusion of the cranial sutures, as has been commonly postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rather, a malformation of the skull base is the most likely primary morphological event, and it leads to the characteristic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>dysmorphic facies</z:hpo>, then secondarily to premature <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe the nature of the malformation is related to an abnormality in the bones which comprise the cranial base base (e.g. the sphenoid, ethmoid, and occipital bones) and to abnormal spatial relationships between the cribriform plate and the crista galli, resulting in a positional disarrangement of the points of basal attachment of the dura matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The latter, then, precludes the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response of the neurocranium to the forces produced by the growing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> is viewed as a symptom, rather than as a cause, of the dysmorphic craniofacial features typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
