<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were pooled to increase the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> births (n = 57) and produce a more stable birth prevalence estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Birth prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> was calculated to be approximately 15.5/1,000,000 births, which is twice the rate determined in earlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major reason appears to be incomplete ascertainment in the earlier studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The similarity of the point estimates and the narrow bounds of the confidence limits in the present study suggest that the birth prevalence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> over different populations is fairly uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation rate was calculated to be 7.8 x 10(-6) per gene per generation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> accounts for about 4.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate appears to be increased compared to that experienced in the general population; however, further study of the problem is necessary </plain></SENT>
