<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The purpose of this report is to show the feasibility and potential advantages of using internal devices for distraction osteogenesis in the management of maxillofacial skeletal deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Distraction osteogenesis was used to correct a variety of maxillofacial skeletal deformities in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent bilateral Le Fort III advancement aided by distraction, three patients underwent mandibular ramus lengthening, and one patient underwent segmental alveolar reconstruction by distraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The devices were activated by either a transcutaneous or transmucosal pin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After achievement of the desired skeletal transport, the activating pins were disengaged and removed from the distraction device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This allowed the distraction device to remain submerged and to stabilize the site of the consolidating bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved lengthening of their jaws </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, premature consolidation was noted in two patients, and one patient had significant relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Development of internal distraction devices is important to address the limitations of currently available biphasic systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Potential benefits of internal devices include 1) elimination of skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0100699'>scarring</z:hpo> caused by translation of transcutaneous fixation pins, 2) improved patient compliance during the fixation or consolidation phase because there is no external component, and 3) improved stability of the attachment of the device to the bone </plain></SENT>
