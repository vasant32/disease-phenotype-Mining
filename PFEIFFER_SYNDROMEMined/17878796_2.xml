<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: To provide a comprehensive radiographic, clinical, and functional description of the shoulder in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 9 Apert syndrome patients (ages, 9-27 years) followed at a tertiary care facility was included in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were clinically assessed with physical examination and completion of 2 validated functional assessment tools, the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (AAOS PODCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Radiographs were obtained of both shoulders, and standardized-protocol magnetic resonance imaging was performed on the dominant shoulder of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had some degree of functional impairment attributable to their shoulder pathologic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Physical examination consistently revealed reduced forward flexion and abduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radiographic findings were similar to previous reports, with pervasive osseous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> of the shoulder joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Medial humeral head <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> was seen in 8 of 9 patients and greater tuberosity <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> in 7 of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder, not previously performed in a cohort of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> patients, allowed better delineation of abnormalities seen radiographically such as a central glenoid cleft seen in 8 of 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also revealed a new finding of inferior glenoid inclination (7/9 patients) that has not been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Very few soft tissue or degenerative abnormalities were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirm that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> are functionally impaired by their shoulder pathologic abnormality, which may have a similar clinical impact as the more well-described hand and foot anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The global functioning of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is equivalent to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The shoulder range of motion in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> patients is decreased, most significantly in flexion and abduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Radiographs confirmed previous imaging findings of glenohumeral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The novel magnetic resonance imaging component demonstrated consistent inferior glenoid inclination, which may be a significant factor in their shoulder impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging revealed no significant soft tissue or degenerative abnormalities to account for their clinical disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These findings have potential relevance in the surgical and clinical management of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV </plain></SENT>
