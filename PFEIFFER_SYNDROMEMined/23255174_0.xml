<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are over 30 cases of prenatally diagnosed sacral extensions or human 'tails' in the literature, including isolated and syndromic etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases were reported to resolve by the second trimester and postnatal course was benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to describe the prenatal findings, associated anomalies, and clinical outcome of a series of seven fetuses diagnosed prenatally with fetal sacrococcygeal extension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective study on a series of 4040 consecutive patients seen through our clinic in a 10-year period, 7 patients had a sacrococcygeal extension identified on fetal imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fetal sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings, results of genetic testing, and clinical outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven fetuses had associated anomalies, including neurologic, craniofacial, cardiac, spinal, renal, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151491" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">musculoskeletal abnormalities</z:e>, or abnormal ultrasound findings including growth restriction and abnormal umbilical cord Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were two cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 13 and one case of Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 19.3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When a sacrococcygeal extension is seen on fetal imaging, work-up should include detailed fetal imaging and karyotype, and fetal growth should be monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our experience with fetal sacrococcygeal extension demonstrates variability in the underlying presentation and etiology, making counseling in a prenatal setting challenging </plain></SENT>
