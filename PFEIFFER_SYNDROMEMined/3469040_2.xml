<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three diagnoses were represented: isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011318'>bicoronal synostosis</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e>; and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e>; there were four subjects in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selected cranial dimensions were measured on roentgencephalograms taken in infancy and at follow-up examinations at 2 to 3 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The measurements were compared with control values obtained from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005170'>cleft lip</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cranial dimensions in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> patients seldom corresponded well with the values of the controls, either before or after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cranial height, in particular, was increased, especially in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>'s or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This resulted in modulus values above the control mean for 11 of the 12 patients at the follow-up examinations </plain></SENT>
