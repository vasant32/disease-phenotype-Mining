<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical timing is a balance between the risk of relapse if performed too early and the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> and ossification defects if performed later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary occipital expansion has been proposed as a method to delay the timing of frontal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have applied the principal of spring expansion of patent sutures to expand the posterior cranial fossa without a cranial osteotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients seen during the 3-year period December 2004-December 2007 underwent initial occipital expansion without osteotomy using spring expansion of the patent lambdoid suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients underwent posterior spring expansion of the patent lambdoid suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Good occipital expansion was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Standard frontal advancement was performed 5-18 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No relapse after frontal advancement has been seen after mean follow-up of 41 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spring expansion of the patent lambdoid suture is an alternative technique to expand the posterior cranial fossa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to current techniques it has very low morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occipital expansion is thought to treat several of the mechanisms responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When performed at 6 months of age it has enabled us to delay the time at which we would normally perform frontal advancement surgery until a time when the surgical result is likely to be more stable </plain></SENT>
