<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall, 32% of patients with significant follow-up review had an intelligence quotient (IQ) greater than 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at operation appeared to be the main factor associated with changes in mental development: final IQ was greater than 70 in 50% of patients operated on before 1 year of age versus only 7.1% in patients operated on later in life (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Malformations of the corpus callosum and size of the ventricles played no role in the final IQ, whereas anomalies of the septum pellucidum had a significant effect, with the proportion of patients with an IQ over 70 increasing more than twofold in patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> septum compared with patients with septal anomalies (p &lt; 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quality of the family environment was the third factor involved in intellectual achievement: only 12.5% of institutionalized children reached a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> IQ level compared to 39.3% of children from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> family background </plain></SENT>
