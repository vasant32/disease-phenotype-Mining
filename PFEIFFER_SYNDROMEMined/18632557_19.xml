<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two nucleotide substitutions in the human FGFR2 gene (C755G or C758G) are responsible for virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This condition is 100-1,000 times more common than genomic mutation frequency data predict </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on the C758G de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using data on older donors, we show that spontaneous mutations are not uniformly distributed throughout <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> testes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Instead, we find foci where C758G mutation frequencies are 3-4 orders of magnitude greater than the remaining tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude this nucleotide site is not a mutation hot spot even after accounting for possible Luria-Delbruck "mutation jackpots." An alternative explanation for such foci involving positive selection acting on adult self-renewing Ap spermatogonia experiencing the rare mutation could not be rejected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the two youngest individuals studied (19 and 23 years old) had lower mutation frequencies and smaller foci at both mutation sites compared with the older individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This implies that the mutation frequency of foci increases as adults age, and thus selection could explain the paternal age effect for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic conditions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results, now including the analysis of two mutations in the same set of testes, suggest that positive selection can increase the relative frequency of premeiotic germ cells carrying such mutations, although individuals who inherit them have reduced fitness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, we compared the anatomical distribution of C758G mutation foci with both new and old data on the C755G mutation in the same testis and found their positions were not correlated with one another </plain></SENT>
