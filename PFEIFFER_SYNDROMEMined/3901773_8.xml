<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been recognized that using the maxillary teeth to deliver extraoral force to the maxilla not only results in sutural remodeling but also periodontal remodeling and tooth movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with severe maxillomandibular malrelationships, the potential for tooth movement often limits the amount and duration of extraoral force and, consequently, affects the success of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This case report describes a technique to intentionally ankylose deciduous teeth in a patient with severe maxillary retrusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ankylosed teeth were used as abutments to deliver an anteriorly directed intermittent extraoral force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 months of treatment, the anterior crossbite was nearly corrected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At that point the ankylosed teeth loosened because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">root resorption</z:e> and the treatment was terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cephalometric superimposition demonstrated that the occlusal correction was the result of anterior maxillary movement with little mandibular growth and no movement of the ankylosed teeth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that intentionally ankylosed teeth may be used as abutments for extraoral traction in patients with a severe disturbance in maxillary growth </plain></SENT>
