<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up was 5.0 years and included clinical, dental, and cephalometric examinations according to a prescribed protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrated that the procedure could be safely performed in the younger child with an acceptable level of morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a remarkable degree of postoperative stability of the maxillary segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, although vertical (inferior) growth or movement of the midfacial segment was demonstrated, there was minimal, if any, anterior or horizontal growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any occlusal disharmony developing during the period of follow-up could be attributed to anticipated mandibular development and could be corrected by orthognathic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The roles of surgical overcorrection and anterior-pull headgear therapy after release of intermaxillary fixation are also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Le Fort III osteotomy is justifiably indicated during early childhood for psychological and physiologic reasons </plain></SENT>
