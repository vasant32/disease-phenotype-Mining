<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> who underwent bilateral superior oblique tucks to specifically address the excyclotorsion of the globes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 16-year-old male with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> presented with apparent bilateral inferior oblique overaction and apparent bilateral superior oblique underaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had 30 prism diopter (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000565'>esotropia</z:hpo> and 5 PD left <z:mp ids='MP_0006199'>hypertropia</z:mp> by simultaneous prism and cover test (SPCT) at distance and near fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fundus exam revealed marked excyclotorsion of both globes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The superior oblique tendons were tucked 10 mm bilaterally, using a 6-0 mersilene suture and the medial rectus muscles were recessed 5.5 mm on an adjustable suture with a 10-mm inferior displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical results were reviewed at 6 weeks and 2 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 6 weeks and 2 years postoperatively, apparent inferior oblique overaction, apparent superior oblique underaction, and V-pattern <z:hpo ids='HP_0000565'>esotropia</z:hpo> were markedly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 2 years, SPCT measurements were 8 PD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000565'>esotropia</z:hpo> in primary position at distance and 4 PD <z:hpo ids='HP_0000565'>esotropia</z:hpo> and 3 PD left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339640" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dissociated vertical deviation</z:e> at near </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral superior oblique tucks are useful in addressing the excyclotorsion that leads to apparent inferior oblique overaction and V-pattern <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
