<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven previous patients with TCS have been reported in the world literature; in each instance, TCS was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report details of five additional patients with TCS, of whom four had a dominantly inherited CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gross examination of the available tracheas and bronchi demonstrates a cartilaginous sleeve with posterior interruption but lacking a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pars membranacea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stained and cleared tracheas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> demonstrate variable ring formation, usually limited to the posterolateral aspect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The functional significance of TCS, if any, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No data are available on the prevalence of TCS in CS syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The formation of TCS implies a common mesenchymal defect in which normally discrete structures fuse and is probably analogous to other mesenchymal abnormalities seen in these patients </plain></SENT>
