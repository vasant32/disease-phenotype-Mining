<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Records of 9 patients (18 hands) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Average age at follow-up was 9.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three relationships between the ring-small metacarpals were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type I hands (22%) had no abnormal interconnections; type II hands (33%) possessed a <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> since birth; type III hands (44%) did not possess a <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> at birth, but one later developed at average age of 79 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> was 77% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent excision of the <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At an average of 16 postoperative months, 4 of these patients experienced improvement in hand prehension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, resection of abnormal interconnections between the ring-small metacarpals is highly recommended to improve hand prehension based on the high incidence of a <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> in this region </plain></SENT>
