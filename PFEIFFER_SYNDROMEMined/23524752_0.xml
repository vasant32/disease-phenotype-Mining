<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the case of an 11-year-old female patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and no prior surgical interventions who presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000244'>turribrachycephaly</z:hpo>, exorbitism, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011800'>midface retrusion</z:hpo>, and apertognathia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A monobloc distraction with simultaneous Le Fort II distraction was planned using computer-aided design and modeling (CAD/CAM) techniques to provide for concurrent distraction of the segments in independent vectors without bony interferences.Monobloc minus Le Fort II distraction was performed without intraoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical time was 340 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 1100 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distraction began on postoperative day 5 at a rate of 1.5 mm/day for the Le Fort II via an external Halo distractor and 1 mm/day for the monobloc segment via internal distractors anchored bitemporally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The monobloc was distracted a total of 17 mm in a horizontal vector, while the Le Fort II segment was distracted 18 mm horizontally and 5 mm inferiorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Halo distractor was removed 3 months following the procedure and the internal distractors 1 month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Monobloc minus Le Fort II distraction enables correction of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> phenotype with a single-stage approach, potentially decreasing the burden of care with improved results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Utilization of CAD/CAM modeling allows for accurate planning of multisegment distraction in independent vectors without concerns for bony interferences </plain></SENT>
