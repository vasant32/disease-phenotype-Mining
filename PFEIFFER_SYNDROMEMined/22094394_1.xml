<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five consecutive patients who underwent monobloc distraction were included (aged 4.8-18.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, one had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, and one had Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evaluation included clinical records, serial cephalograms for at least 1-year follow up (average 24.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment and post-treatment changes were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intracranial volume, upper airway volume and globe protrusion were calculated from CT before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After distraction, the supraorbital region was advanced 15.3mm forward, the midface demonstrated forward advancement of 17.7 mm, 22.1mm and 23.1mm at orbitale, anterior nasal spine and A point, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The downward movement was 2-3mm at maxillary level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intracranial volume increased 11%; the upper airway volume increased 85% on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Globe protrusion reduced 3.7 mm on average, which was 20% of underlying skeletal movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Facial growth demonstrated forward remodelling of the supraorbital region, mild downward but no further forward growth of the midface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Monobloc distraction is effective for relieving related symptoms and signs through differential external distraction at different vertical levels of the face </plain></SENT>
