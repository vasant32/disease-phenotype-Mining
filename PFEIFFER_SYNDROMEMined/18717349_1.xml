<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Since 2000, 11 cases (10 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> and 1 case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>) with severe midface deficiency were treated with Le Fort III osteotomy and midface DO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The section area of different parts of upper-airway were tested by computer assistants image measurement preoperatively and postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some patients received sleep function monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The face appearance and the function of upper-airway improved significantly after Le Fort III osteotomy and Midface DO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The section area at the level of posterior nasal spine and uvula increased obviously after treatment (P &lt; 0.05), however the section area at the level of epiglottis and separation between airway and esophagus were not obviously enlarged (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Midface DO after Le Fort III osteotomy can effectively improve the upper-airway narrow, especially the upper part from uvula </plain></SENT>
