<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes are clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with overlapping features, which make an accurate diagnosis difficult at times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the clarification of a genetic lesion does not have a direct impact on patient management in many cases, there is a significant benefit in providing accurate prenatal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genetic counsellors are also able to offer better risk estimates of recurrences to non-manifesting carriers and their extended family members and for affected patients of reproductive age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Advances in gene discovery have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes delineated on clinical bases, with the possible exception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, are genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, and mutations have been found in fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) 1, 2, 3 and TWIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We surveyed 99 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> patients at the molecular level and found mutations in 50 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six novel point mutations were identified: three in FGFR2 and three in TWIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two Saethre-Chotzen patients with TWIST microdeletions at 7p21 were also found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other mutations identified have been previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In studying these 99 patients, we developed a diagnostic strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> testing, where sequential analysis of recurrent mutations was followed by selective sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This algorithm makes testing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> disorders more efficient and cost-effective </plain></SENT>
