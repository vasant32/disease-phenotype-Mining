<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to describe the neuropathological phenotype in PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present four severe fetal cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> PS with FGFR2 mutations who underwent termination followed by fetopathological and neuropathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the expression pattern of Fgfr2 in the mouse brain using radioactive fluorescence in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PS is associated with brain deformations due to the abnormal skull shape, but FGFR2 mutations also induce specific brain developmental anomalies: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001355'>megalencephaly</z:hpo>, midline disorders, amygdala, and hippocampus malformations, and ventricular wall alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression pattern of Fgfr2 in mice matches the distribution of malformations in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brain anomalies in PS result from the combination of mechanical deformations and intrinsic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorders</z:e> due to FGFR2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Several similarities are noted between these anomalies and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> observed in other syndromes due to mutations in FGF-receptor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specific involvement of the hippocampus and the amygdala should encourage the precise cognitive screening of patients with mild forms of PS </plain></SENT>
