<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here a previously undescribed mechanism involved in the altered osteoblastogenesis in SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cranial osteoblasts from an SCS patient with a Twist mutation causing basic helix-loop-helix deletion exhibited decreased expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> compared with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was associated with decreased ubiquitin-mediated degradation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26025">phosphatidyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> 3 kinase (PI3K) and increased PI3K expression and PI3K/Akt signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased PI3K immunoreactivity was also found in osteoblasts in histological sections of affected cranial sutures from SCS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfection with Twist or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> abolished the increased PI3K/Akt signaling in Twist mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forced overexpression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi> did not correct the altered expression of osteoblast differentiation markers in Twist mutant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/Akt, but not ERK signaling, corrected the increased cell growth in Twist mutant osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results show that Twist haploinsufficiency results in decreased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>-mediated PI3K degradation in osteoblasts, causing PI3K accumulation and activation of PI3K/Akt-dependent osteoblast growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This provides genetic and biochemical evidence for a role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28911">Cbl</z:chebi>-mediated PI3K signaling in the altered osteoblast phenotype induced by Twist haploinsufficiency in SCS </plain></SENT>
