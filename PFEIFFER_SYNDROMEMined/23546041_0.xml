<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two Indonesian patients with AS, in whom molecular analysis detected p.Ser252Trp (c.755C&gt;G) and p.Pro253Arg (c.758C&gt;G) mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the syndrome has been frequently described, this is the first clinical report of AS confirmed by molecular analysis in Indonesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference in severity of clinical features in the two patients may be consistent with a genotype-phenotype correlation of the FGFR2mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The management of individuals with AS is best achieved within a multidisciplinary setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in most developing countries, early intervention may be delayed due to late diagnosis, a lack of facilities and financial constraints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report underpins the benefits of early diagnosis for AS management </plain></SENT>
