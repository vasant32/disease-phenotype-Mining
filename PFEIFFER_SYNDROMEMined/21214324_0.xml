<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Design : Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Setting : Department of Orthodontics, Children's Hospital Erasmus Medical Centre, Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients, Participants : Sixty-two patients (37 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> and 25 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>) born between 1971 and 2001 (age range 3.9 to 32Â years) and 482 nonsyndromic children as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interventions : Lateral cephalograms performed prior to any midfacial surgery of 62 patients and 482 nonsyndromic children were traced and horizontal and vertical measurements were digitized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Main Outcome Measures : Cephalometric measurements of SNA, SNB, ANB, NSMe, and SN/palatal plane angles and lower facial height ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results : Horizontal measurements for the syndromic groups showed no change in SNA angle during growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SNA angles were lower in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> compared to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The syndromic groups showed smaller values for ANB angles compared to the nonsyndromic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vertical measurements showed increased lower facial height ratios for the syndromic groups compared to control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was an increasing counterclockwise rotation of the palatal plane in relation to the anterior cranial base in syndromic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>NSMe angles among the three groups were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusions : Based on the growth differences identified, the sagittal and vertical jaw relationships differ in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Syndromic patients show aggravation of midfacial underdevelopment and anterior rotation of the mandible </plain></SENT>
