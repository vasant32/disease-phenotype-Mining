<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In particular, coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> evidences a higher tendency to be genetically caused, and TWIST1 and FGFR3 have been identified as major causative genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors analyzed the clinical and molecular characteristics of Korean patients with coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three Korean patients with unicoronal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011318'>bicoronal synostosis</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> samples were first screened for TWIST1 and FGFR3 mutation hot spots, and the negative samples were subsequently screened for FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' clinical features were analyzed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven sequence alterations (six in TWIST1 and one in FGFR3) were identified in 11 patients (25.6 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three novel TWIST1 mutations were detected, and p.P250R was the only mutation in FGFR3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Bicoronal cases evidenced a much higher mutation detection rate (52.9 percent) than unicoronal cases (7.7 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the TWIST1 group, five patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, and one was nonsyndromic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the FGFR3 group, four patients had Muenke syndrome, and one was nonsyndromic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority of associated anomalies, with the exception of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformation</z:hpo>, were detected more frequently in TWIST1 patients than in FGFR3 p.P250R patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first to illustrate the frequency and spectrum of mutations in TWIST1 and FGFR3 in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Considering that molecular diagnosis techniques can prove helpful in providing adequate genetic counseling and guidance, genetic screening for TWIST1 and FGFR3 p.P250R in cases of coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> is recommended </plain></SENT>
