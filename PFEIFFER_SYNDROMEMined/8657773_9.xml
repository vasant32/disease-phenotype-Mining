<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This paper describes the role of the displacement of bone centers, i.e., the tubers, in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This displacement was studied in 54 patients with isolated or syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in the form of CT scans as well as in two dry neonate skulls with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For comparison, 49 fetal and 8 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> infant dry skulls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our investigation was restricted to the coronal and metopic sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed a significantly more occipital localization of the frontal bone center and a more frontal localization of the parietal bone center at the side of a synostotic coronal suture in the isolated form as well as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, this was not the case in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, thus showing that these two syndromes have a different pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000243'>trigonocephaly</z:hpo>, a more anteromedial localization of the frontal bone centers was found </plain></SENT>
