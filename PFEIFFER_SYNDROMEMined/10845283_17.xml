<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also tested was the hypothesis that coincident sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> could modulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> and affect whether a primary or secondary frontal operation was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected on age and indications for initial operation, type of primary and secondary frontal procedures, and concomitant sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients initially managed by subcranial Le Fort III were included in the study group but excluded from analysis of fronto-orbital advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients treated by monobloc advancement or Le Fort III osteotomies with frontal grafting or Anderl modification were assessed as having had primary fronto-orbital advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Minimum time to follow-up was 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 126 patients met inclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lateral photographs were examined to assess preoperative and postoperative sagittal position of supraorbital rims-to-globes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Frontal re-advancement was indicated if the corneal apex was anterior to the supraorbital rim </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Foreheadplasty was indicated for unacceptable frontal contour and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> supraorbital rim-to-globe relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Primary correction for frontal retrusion was not required in 4 percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> (1 of 25), 16 percent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> (7 of 44), 6 percent of Pfeiffer (2 of 31), and 19 percent of Saethre-Chotzen (5 of 26) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of those infants who had a primary fronto-orbital advancement, reoperation for either supraorbital retrusion or frontal deformity was necessary in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 16 Apert patients and in 5 of 19 Crouzon (26 percent), 10 of 26 Pfeiffer (38 percent), and 13 of 20 Saethre-Chotzen (65 percent) patients (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Age at initial fronto-orbital advancement did not influence reoperative rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between concomitant sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> and necessity for primary or secondary frontal correction (p = 0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In summary, phenotypic diagnosis was determinant for outcome as defined by need for secondary fronto-orbital advancement, foreheadplasty, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> patients had the highest incidence of reoperation for frontal retrusion or forehead contour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and Saethre-Chotzen patients were most likely to express a minor phenotype and not require fronto-orbital correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Coincident sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> did not influence frontal projection, as reflected in need for either primary or secondary frontal advancement </plain></SENT>
