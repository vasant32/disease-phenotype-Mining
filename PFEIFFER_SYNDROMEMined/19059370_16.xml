<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To characterize pregnancy outcome in women receiving bisphosphonates, we conducted a multi-centre, prospective cohort study with a comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were recruited through 3 teratogen information centres in Canada and South Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We followed 21 women exposed to bisphosphonates during or &lt;3 months before pregnancy, and 21 matched-comparison group women without exposure to known <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50905">teratogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pregnancy/neonatal outcome data were collected by interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was neonatal outcome including major birth defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The secondary endpoints included other pregnancy outcomes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Indication of the therapy was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the maternal demographics between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the bisphosphonate group, there were 18 live births, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> and 1 therapeutic abortion, which were not significantly different from the comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean gestational age (mean+/-SD) of the bisphosphonate group was 38.7+/-1.9 weeks (comparison group: 39.3+/-1.9 weeks; P=0.42), and the mean birth weight was 3.1+/-0.3 kg (comparison group: 3.3+/-0.5 kg; P=0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the bisphosphonate group, there was a child diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephalosyndactyly</z:e>, with a fibroblast growth factor 2 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Coupled with existing data in the literature, our findings suggest that preconceptional and first-trimester use of bisphosphonates may not pose substantial fetal risks </plain></SENT>
