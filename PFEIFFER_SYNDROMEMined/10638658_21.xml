<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These techniques allow one to reproduce anatomical objects as 3D physical models, which give the surgeon a realistic impression of complex structures before a surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The shift from the visual to the visual-tactile representation of anatomical objects introduces a new kind of interaction called 'touch to comprehend' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As can be seen, from the presented case studies of maxillo-cranio-facial surgery, the RP models are very well suited for use in the diagnosis and the precise preoperative simulation of skeleton modifying interventions </plain></SENT>
