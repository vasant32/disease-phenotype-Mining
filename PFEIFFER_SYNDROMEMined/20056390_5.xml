<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Midface advancement is often the treatment of choice, but the few papers on long-term outcome report mixed results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper aimed to assess the long-term respiratory outcome of midface advancement in syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> with OSA and to determine factors contributing to its efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study was performed on 11 patients with moderate or severe OSA, requiring oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or tracheostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms, results of polysomnography, endoscopy and digital volume measurement of the upper airways on CT scan before and after midface advancement were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Midface advancement had a good respiratory outcome in the short term in 6 patients and was ineffective in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without respiratory effect or with relapse, endoscopy showed obstruction of the rhino- or hypopharynx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volume measurements supported the clinical and endoscopic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite midface advancement, long-term dependence on, or indication for, CPAP or tracheostomy was maintained in 5 of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pharyngeal collapse appeared to play a role in OSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endoscopy before midface advancement is recommended to identify <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> that may interfere with respiratory improvement after midface advancement </plain></SENT>
