<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analysed radiographs of the cervical spine, hands and feet of a large patient population with genetically proven SCS and MTM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to describe the pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal anomalies</z:hpo> and to determine whether specific features are present that could help differentiate between the two entities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiographs of 43 patients (23 males, 20 females) with SCS (n=35) or MTM (n=8) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 8 years (range 1 month-36 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> radiographs were reviewed by two radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the hands and feet, a variety of anomalies such as brachyphalangy, <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactyly</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006101'>partial syndactyly</z:hpo>, partial carpal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0008368'>tarsal fusion</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010579'>cone-shaped epiphyses</z:hpo> were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duplicated distal phalanx of the hallux (n=12/35) and triangular deformity of the epiphysis of the distal phalanx of the hallux (n=10/35) were detected in SCS only; calcaneo-cuboid fusion (n=2/35) was detected in MTM only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cervical spine, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>fusion of vertebral bodies</z:hpo> and/or the posterior elements occurred only in patients with SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pathognomonic signs for SCS are the triangular shape of the epiphysis and duplicated distal phalanx of the hallux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Calcaneo-cuboid fusion was detected in MTM only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These signs may be helpful in the differentiation of SCS from MTM </plain></SENT>
