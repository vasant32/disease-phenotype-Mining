<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to identify the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000674'>dental agenesis</z:hpo> for each type of tooth and to look for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000674'>dental agenesis</z:hpo> patterns in persons with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial panoramic radiographs of 23 individuals (five male patients and 18 female patients) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Third molars were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> for at least one tooth was 34.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Up to two <z:hpo ids='HP_0006349'>missing teeth</z:hpo> were found for individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maxillary lateral incisors and mandibular second premolars were the most frequently <z:hpo ids='HP_0006349'>missing teeth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four different <z:hpo ids='HP_0000674'>dental agenesis</z:hpo> patterns of the entire dentition were identified by using the tooth <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> code (<z:chebi fb="44" ids="53498">TAC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patterns occurred more frequently, both of which were symmetrical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One involved the simultaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">absence of teeth</z:e> 12 and 22, and the other showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath> of teeth 35 and 45 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> were found to exhibit a high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000674'>dental agenesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
