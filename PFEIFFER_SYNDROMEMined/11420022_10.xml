<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complications of distraction osteogenesis are well described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a complication of using an external distraction device in a 9-year-old girl with Pfeiffer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION AND RESULTS: A modified Lefort III osteotomy was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000327'>maxillary hypoplasia</z:hpo> with application of an external distraction halo device by a pediatric neurosurgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan showed 0.5-cm skull penetration of the cranial pins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pins were repositioned and the patient was followed up on a regular basis until discharge from the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3-week follow-up, a CT scan of the head showed migration of the pins 1.5 cm intracranially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The halo was removed and repositioned at a different site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No detectable neurological sequelae from the pin penetration were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> at the site of the penetration and was admitted to the hospital for a course of intravenous antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no other complications, and the rest of her treatment course proceeded as planned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A review of the literature on complications of halo usage as well as suggestions for their management in association with distraction osteogenesis is described </plain></SENT>
