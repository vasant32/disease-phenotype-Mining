<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis and treatment can relieve symptoms and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the development and natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome through life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate our experience of clinical history and treatment modalities concerning <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome from birth until the current age in children with syndromal craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children with one of the three syndromal craniofacial synostoses (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, or Pfeiffer) born between 1984 and 2001 were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The medical history and symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome were assessed by retrospective analysis of the medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present and past complaints were explored by means of a questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of the medical records showed a suspicion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome in 26% of the children compared with 53% in the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The severity and presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome were not related to the age of the child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>Obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome symptoms occurred in almost half of the children during colds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several symptoms were significantly more common in children with a high suspicion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Treatment modalities consisted of adenotonsillectomies, continuous positive airway pressure, and Le Fort III surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Use of a standard questionnaire showed that the suspicion for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome in children with syndromal craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> is much higher than reported in the medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Regular screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome with a standard questionnaire could be of additional value for the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndrome in children with syndromal craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
