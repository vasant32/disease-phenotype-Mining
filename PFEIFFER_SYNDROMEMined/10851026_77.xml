<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) play a critical role in bone growth and development affecting both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the process of intramembranous ossification, which leads to the formation of the flat bones of the skull, unregulated FGF signaling can produce <z:mp ids='MP_0000081'>premature suture closure</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and other craniofacial deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indeed, many human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> disorders have been linked to activating mutations in FGF receptors (FGFR) 1 and 2, but the precise effects of FGF on the proliferation, maturation and differentiation of the target osteoblastic cells are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we studied the effects of FGF treatment on primary murine calvarial osteoblast, and on OB1, a newly established osteoblastic cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We show that FGF signaling has a dual effect on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FGFs activate the endogenous FGFRs leading to the formation of a Grb2/FRS2/Shp2 complex and activation of MAP kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, immature osteoblasts respond to FGF treatment with increased proliferation, whereas in differentiating cells FGF does not induce DNA synthesis but causes <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When either primary or OB1 osteoblasts are induced to differentiate, FGF signaling inhibits expression of alkaline phosphatase, and blocks mineralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To study the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>-linked mutations in osteoblasts, we introduced FGFR2 carrying either the C342Y (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>) or the S252W (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>) mutation in OB1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both mutations inhibited differentiation, while dramatically inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we could also show that overexpression of FGF2 in transgenic mice leads to <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in their calvaria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data provide the first biochemical analysis of FGF signaling in osteoblasts, and show that FGF can act as a cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> inducer with distinct effects in proliferating and differentiating osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
