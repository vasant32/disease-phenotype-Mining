<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors performed retrospective digital analysis on temporal fine-cut computed tomographic images to quantify both radiographic evidence of pterygomaxillary region bone formation and relative maxillary stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 8.7 years; 11 had either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average displacement of the maxilla during distraction was 16.2 mm (range, 7 to 31 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Digital analysis was performed on fine-cut computed tomographic scans before surgery, at device removal, and at annual follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients also had mid-consolidation computed tomographic scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relative maxillary stability and density of radiographic bone in the pterygomaxillary region were calculated between each scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no evidence of clinically significant maxillary relapse, rotation, or growth between the end of consolidation and 1-year follow-up, other than a relatively small 2-mm subnasal maxillary vertical growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was an average radiographic ossification of 0.5 mm/mm advancement at the time of device removal, with a 25th percentile value of 0.3 mm/mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The time during consolidation that each patient reached the 25th percentile of pterygomaxillary region bone density observed in this series of clinically stable advancements ranged from 1.3 to 9.8 weeks (average, 3.7 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was high variability in the amount of bone formed in the pterygomaxillary region associated with clinical stability of the advanced Le Fort III segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a subsection of patients generate the minimal amount of pterygomaxillary region bone formation associated with advancement stability as early as 4 weeks into consolidation </plain></SENT>
