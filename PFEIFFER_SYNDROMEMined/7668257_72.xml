<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A phenotypic and genotypic survey was conducted on 36 Apert syndrome patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient, an FGFR2 mutation, either S252W or P253R, was found in exon IIIa (exon U or 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency was 71% and 26%, for the mutations S252W and P253R, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mutations occur in the linker region between immunoglobulin-like domains II and III, which are involved in activation of the receptor by ligand binding and dimerization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fact that one patient did not have a mutation in the same exon suggests further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of occurrence or means for measurements of 29 different clinical features (including severity of craniofacial features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> of the hands and feet, and multisystem involvement) were determined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and for the two subgroups defined by their mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparison between the subgroups for the different clinical features was performed and suggested no statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results are not unexpected, because the two common mutations for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> alter FGFR2 at adjacent amino acids that are likely to have similar biological, and therefore phenotypic, consequences </plain></SENT>
