<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The management is difficult, and mny different approaches have been published </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hands demonstrate many disturbances of soft tissue and bony structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These include a <z:hpo ids='HP_0009778'>short thumb</z:hpo> with radial <z:mp ids='MP_0006253'>clinodactyly</z:mp>, complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> with a bony fusion involving the index, long and ring fingers, and symphalangism and simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> of the fourth web space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The soft tissue anomalies involve the intrinsic muscles, the extrinsic tendon insertions, and the neurovascular bundles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Correction of the appearance of the operated hand is readily apparent, but the complexity of the disorders in the bones and soft tissues explains the difficulty of the surgical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to propose a better surgical management: on the basis of the experience of our multidisciplinary team (188 procedures in 53 patients) in the light of recent publications and a better comprehension of the syndrome, we attempt to reduce the number of procedures and to select the best possible procedures for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When possible, we perform a 3-step procedure (the first is bilateral, the others are unilateral) between 9 months and 2 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Separation of the fingers improves function even though we must expect an inevitable stiffness in extension of the interphalangeal joints </plain></SENT>
