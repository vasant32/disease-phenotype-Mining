<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The presence of intracranial foreign body granulomas is an unusual condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They can be caused by foreign substances which are either inadvertently or deliberately left in the surgical field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some foreign materials (textilomas, gossypibomas, gauzomas, muslinomas) along with the resulting foreign body reaction, in the surrounding tissue, can cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> formation in an early stage whereas others remain clinically silent for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT: We present the case of a foreign body granuloma (textiloma) caused by a gauze which had been placed, during a corrective craniotomy, in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> at the age of five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At presentation the clinical and radiological findings were suggestive of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Surgical exploration of the region demonstrated the presence of gauze, in a frontal bone defect, surrounded by large masses of reactive granular tissue which were extended to the underlying dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The symptoms resolved completely after the foreign body's retrieval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Foreign body granulomas, although rare, must always be taken under consideration in the differential diagnosis of craniofacial masses or procedures; especially in cases where a previous craniofacial operation has taken place </plain></SENT>
