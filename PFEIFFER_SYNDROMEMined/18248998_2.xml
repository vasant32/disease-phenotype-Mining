<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> frequently develop functional problems including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e>, ocular dysfunction, obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnoeas</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These functional problems can be treated by a number of different techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The monobloc frontofacial advancement has the ability to correct <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these functional problems in one procedure, but can be associated with high morbidity particularly in the young infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: A case report of a 4-month-old infant with Pfeiffers syndrome and severe functional problems treated by monobloc osteotomy and distraction using the rigid external distractor is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The management, problems and complications encountered with this patient are discussed together with the role of monobloc distraction in the infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adaptation of the rigid external distraction (RED) technique using two <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> mesh sheets to prevent penetration of the skull by the cranial pins is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Monobloc frontofacial advancement in the very young can be successfully achieved using the RED frame, thus treating exophthalmus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> and upper airway problems in one operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, it may be associated with significant complications and should only be used for those extreme cases where the severity of the functional problems prevent treatment being delayed </plain></SENT>
