<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The average patient age at last follow-up evaluation was 7 years (range, 3-17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Type I deformities (7 hands) had little or no angular deformity at the metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint; two-stage reconstruction created a four-fingered hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type IIA deformities (11 hands) had mild MP joint angular deformity and a more proximal complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> of the middle three digits; two-stage reconstruction created a three-fingered hand with ray resection of the third digit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Type IIB deformities (7 hands) had pronation of digit 2 superimposed on the thumb and radial angulation at the MP joint of digit 2; two-stage reconstruction created a three-fingered hand with ray resection of the second digit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Type IIC deformities (3 hands) had <z:mp ids='MP_0008909'>supination</z:mp> of digit 4 superimposed on digit 5 with ulnar angulation at the MP joint of digits 4 and 5; two-stage reconstruction created a three-fingered hand with ray resection of the fourth digit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report presents a classification system and four different treatment strategies based on presenting radiographs </plain></SENT>
