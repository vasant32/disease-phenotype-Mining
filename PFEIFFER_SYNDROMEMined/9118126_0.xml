<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="33348">tantalum</z:chebi> implants were used to define cranial bone position on serial cephalometric surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Image correction (ICCA method) was used to eliminate artifactual shift of component markers before serial analysis was used to define implant movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, applicable normative standards were used to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> case presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects comprised a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mixed longitudinal sample aged 2 to 84 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo> subjects were studied, one from 6 to 77 months and the other from 16 to 44 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> subjects demonstrated both abnormal and normalized growth following craniotomy, from 14 to 45, from 0.5 to 5.5, and from 2 to 75 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A pattern of backward rotation of cranial component <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> was observed in three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The posterior fossa (PF) showed the greatest growth activity, with displacement adjustments throughout the study, and the anterior cranial fossa (ACF) least growth activity, with imperceptible frontal bone movement after age 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After traditional bifrontal craniotomy, an abnormal displacement growth pattern was observed from age 14 to 45 months in the patient with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> (Pfeiffer syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extensive fronto-parietal "bossing" and grossly deficient movement in the PF were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, after a bifrontal craniotomy that also crossed lambdoid sutures, a normalized pattern of displacement growth was observed in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These two patients with extensive syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> had cranial component pattern adjustments as in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and plagiocephalic subjects </plain></SENT>
