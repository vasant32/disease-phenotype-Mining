<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Midfacial distraction following Le Fort III osteotomy has become an established procedure for midfacial advancement of syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A frequent difficulty is the precise three dimensional (3D) alignment of the distracted midface and the proper fixation of the distraction device in the midfacial area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we present an individual modification method for commercial distraction devices comprising the establishment of prefabricated fixation plates and parallel connecting pins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL: Individual prefabricated fixation plates for the zygomatic buttress were combined with two commercial distraction devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The fixation plates were made by a casting technique using individual cranial models as templates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter were fabricated by the rapid prototyping technique of 3D powder printing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For precise realization of the distraction vector, two commercial devices were combined and attached rigidly to the fixation plates by two parallel pins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: In the clinical routine, the 3D powder printing technique enables the simple fabrication of precise individual cranial models, which are required for manufacturing individual fixation plates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of two commercial distraction devices facilitates the appropriate transfer of complex distraction vectors into the midfacial area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The technique presented should be useful for a precise multi-directional midfacial distraction following Le Fort III osteotomy </plain></SENT>
