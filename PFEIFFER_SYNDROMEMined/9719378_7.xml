<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since these two alterations have been observed exclusively among these patients, it has been suggested that the S252W and P253R changes may play an important role in the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to verify whether the mutations S252W and P253R could also cause a milder phenotype, without involvement of the limbs, we have screened 22 patients with clinical characteristics compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> or Pfeiffer syndrome for these two particular changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, we identified a Pfeiffer-like patient with the mutation S252W, and therefore we have shown for the first time the occurrence of one of the canonical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> mutations without severe abnormalities of the upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
