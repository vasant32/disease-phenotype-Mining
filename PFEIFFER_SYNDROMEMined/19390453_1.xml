<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Twins with Pfeiffer syndrome (or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephalosyndactyly</z:e>) had a similar phenotypic appearance with findings of classic or type 1 Pfeiffer syndrome, including bicoronal and sagittal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="CRS|CSO|CRS1">craniosynostoses</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011304'>broad thumbs</z:hpo>/toes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We document their treatment with 2 monobloc advancements and discuss growth disturbances in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: At 6 months, both twins underwent release of multisuture (bilateral coronal and sagittal) fusions for improvement of scaphocephalic shape and multisuture release; however, one twin had a more aggressive procedure with advancement of the frontal-orbital region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite improved initial correction by one twin, at 5 years of age, both twins presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo> and exorbitism and underwent a monobloc distraction procedure with similar 20-mm advancements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparative analysis by our craniofacial multidisciplinary team included perioperative reports, computed tomographic scans, cephalograms, parent questionnaires, and physician surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both twins had an improved confidence interval scores from 84 to 68 and 82 to 69 postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6-month follow-up, the Whitaker score of the first twin was 2.8, whereas that for the second twin with the frontal-orbital advancement was 1.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preschool expressive and receptive tests yielded 97 and 95, and 97 and 98, and developmental testing was similar between the twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Global evaluations were equivalent to age-matched controls, and memory and attention skills were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parental surveys showed a high level of satisfaction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures in both twins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the phenotypic outcome for both twins remained unchanged when comparing a more aggressive surgery to less aggressive surgery as an infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The genetic mutation may have overridden the different surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both twins ultimately required 2 subsequent monobloc corrections </plain></SENT>
