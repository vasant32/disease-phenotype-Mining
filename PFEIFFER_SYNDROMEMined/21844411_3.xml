<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine syndrome-specific type, severity, and prevalence of hearing loss to facilitate follow-up and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Tertiary pediatric hospital craniofacial clinic survey study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If insufficient or no data were available for a child, he or she was referred to an audiologist for pure-tone audiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic research facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Information was gathered regarding 132 children and young adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was hearing assessment of children and young adults with various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A secondary outcome was inference regarding the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> among children and young adults with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found mild or moderate hearing loss in 44.0% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, in 28.5% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e>, in 62.1% with Muenke syndrome, in 28.6% with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, and in 6.7% with complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss was conductive in most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndromes</z:e> and it was predominantly sensorineural in patients with Muenke syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> at lower frequencies was found only in patients with Muenke syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with syndromic and complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000403'>recurrent otitis media</z:hpo> with effusion, causing episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> throughout their lives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> can occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 syndromes studied but is the primary cause of hearing loss in children and young adults with Muenke syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients with these syndromes, we recommend routine visits to the general practitioner or otolaryngologist, depending on national standards of care, to screen for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> with effusion throughout life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We also advise early screening for <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> among children and young adults with these syndromes </plain></SENT>
