<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients were North American Caucasians who had undergone early suture release but no facial repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The indices were compared with those in healthy controls of the same age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The wide intercanthal distance in relation to the narrow soft nose was the most frequent (81.5%) and extensive (17.7% above the maximum <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> index value) disproportion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal indices occurred most often with the combination of one abnormal and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> measurement (61.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven of the 16 disproportions seen in both age subgroups increased in frequency nonsignificantly with age: the supernormal cephalic, intercanthal, nasal, and vertical mandibulofacial indices and the subnormal nasofacial, upper face, and jaws' arcs indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the six disproportions that decreased in frequency with age, four changed significantly (the supernormal frontoparietal and frontozygomatic indices and the subnormal mandibulofacial and nasozygomatic indices) and two changed nonsignificantly (the supernormal intercanthoalar and subnormal cheilozygomatic indices) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the exception of two nasal proportions, the extent of the disproportionality decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the indices that increased with age </plain></SENT>
