<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Radiologic abnormalities including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>vertebral fusion</z:hpo> were present in 9 of the 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fusion of both the vertebral bodies and the posterior elements was noted, although the latter site was more common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C2-3 was the level most commonly involved, although other levels were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of sequential radiographs in nine patients revealed evidence of progression in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those studies in children aged under 2 years, only 1 of 18 films showed evidence of fusion, while in those over 2 years of age, 10 of 12 showed evidence of fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results reveal that the incidence of cervical anomalies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> is greater than that in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is both direct and indirect evidence that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>vertebral fusions</z:hpo> are progressive during childhood </plain></SENT>
