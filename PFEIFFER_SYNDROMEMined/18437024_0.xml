<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He also exhibited anthrophobia with a passive character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with internal monoblock distraction osteogenesis to increase the intracranial and intraorbital volumes, and the nasal and pharyngeal airway spaces using two modular mid-facial internal distractors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For distraction, the latency period was 1 week, the daily activation of 1.0 mm was 20 days (total advancement 20 mm at the midline), and the consolidation period was 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up computed tomography 12 months after surgery showed expansion of the brain and proper ossification in the distracted area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient also showed aesthetically good cranial contours, improved tongue and eyeball protrusion, no respiratory difficulty, and improved learning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the internal distraction may last longer than an external type, resulting in a better bone fusion rate and successful expansion of craniofacial bones </plain></SENT>
