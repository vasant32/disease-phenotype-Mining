<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most mutations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Pfeiffer, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndromes</z:e> are in the extracellular, third immunoglobulin-like domain and adjacent linker regions (exons IIIa and IIIc) of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the published primers for PCR, a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> was found to be homozygous for a mutation that results in a Q289P amino acid substitution in FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients; one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and P253R mutation, the other with Pfeiffer syndrome and S267P mutation, also appeared to be homozygous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a new primer located 146 bp 5' of exon IIIa for PCR followed by sequencing revealed an A to G polymorphism at -62 [corrected] position of exon IIIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients were heterozygous for both the mutation and the polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the polymorphism and the mutation are not on the same chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The single nucleotide polymorphism is located at the second to the last base of the 3' end of the published primer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This primer mismatch caused the failure of amplification of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome and thus, the apparent homozygosity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of this novel polymorphism was determined to be 0.03 by studying 326 chromosomes from the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that a new primer should be used for mutational analysis of exon IIIa of FGFR2 to avoid misdiagnosis caused by primer mismatch </plain></SENT>
