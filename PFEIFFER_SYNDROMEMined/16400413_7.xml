<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to correlate brain malformations and timing for surgery with neuropsychological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also tried to determine other relevant aspects involved in cognitive development of these patients such as social classification of families and parents education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> were studied, whose ages were between 14 and 322 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain abnormalities were observed in 55.6% of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intelligence quotient or developmental quotient values observed were between 45 and 108 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mental development was related to the quality of family environment and parents education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mental development was not correlated to brain malformation or age at time of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, quality of family environment was the most significant factor directly involved in mental development of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
