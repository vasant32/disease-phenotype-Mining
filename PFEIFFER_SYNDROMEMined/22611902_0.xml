<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to describe and compare the main facial and intraoral features of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndromes</z:e>, the clinical manifestations that may be present, additionally to the main syndromic traits, as well as the cranio-maxillofacial surgical treatment protocols followed.Twenty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> (6 males, 17 females), and 28 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> (20 males, 8 females) were evaluated for general medical aspects, craniofacial characteristics, dentoalveolar traits before and after the final orthognathic surgery, and types and timing of cranio-maxillofacial operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>Mental retardation</z:hpo>, associated additional malformations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, and extensive lateral palatal soft tissue swellings were more common in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both syndromes, clinical findings included concave profile, negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011095'>overjet</z:hpo>, posterior crossbites, anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0010807'>openbite</z:hpo>, and dental midline deviation, which were corrected in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with the final orthognathic surgery, with the exception of the lateral crossbites, including more than one tooth pair, which were persisting in about half of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cranial vault decompression and/or reshaping, midfacial and orbital advancement procedures, often in conjunction with a mandibular setback, were the most frequent cranio-maxillofacial operations performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is more asymmetric in nature and a more severe clinical entity than <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The syndromic dentofacial features of both conditions could be significantly improved after a series of surgical procedures in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with the exception of the posterior crossbites, with haIf of them persisting post-surgically </plain></SENT>
