<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven cases (age, 5-16 yrs) with severe midface <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013393" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysostosis</z:e> complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo>, anterior crossbite and upper airway stenosis were treated by using Le Fort III osteotomy and midfacial DO from August 2000 to February 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 3D reconstruction of the upper-airway from CT data was used to evaluate the upper airway volume before and after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And meanwhile polysomnography was carried out to demonstrate the upper airway functional changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a 64.3% mean increase [mean, (9.13 +/- 6.94) ml, P &lt; 0.05] in upper airway volume in the 11 cases after the operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It showed that there was significant improvements in the indexes of polysomnography after the operations, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001956'>hypopnea</z:mp> index, average SaO2, minimum oxygen saturation and snore index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The Le Fort III osteotomy and midfacial distraction osteogenesis can efficiently relieve the symptoms of upper-airway stenosis in severe midfacial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013393" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysostosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
