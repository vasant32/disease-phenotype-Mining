<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 15 out of 16 families previously reported, the disease was caused by homozygosity for truncating mutations, and currently only a single missense mutation has been identified in a compound heterozygote </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a further 8 independent families comprising 10 affected individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e>, who were positive for mutations in RAB23 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the first homozygous missense mutation and in-frame deletion, highlighting key residues for RAB23 function, as well as the first splice-site mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multi-suture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004083'>polysyndactyly</z:mp> have been present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients described to date, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000811'>abnormal external genitalia</z:hpo> have been universal in boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High birth weight was not evident in the current group of patients, but further evidence for laterality defects is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No genotype-phenotype correlations are apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We provide experimental evidence that transcripts encoding truncating mutations are subject to nonsense-mediated decay, and that this plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many RAB23 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations refine the phenotypic spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e> and offer new insights into molecular pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
