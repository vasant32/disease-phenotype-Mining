<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe here a simplified surgical approach to hand surgery that enables several operative steps to be performed during one session and thus reduces the total number of surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After visualising with MSCT angiography the bone and soft-tissue malformations and blood vessels, the operation is planned carefully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transection and removal of the bony and cartilaginous bridges between the symphalangeal fingers is followed by placement of silastic sheets between the separated fingers for a period of 2 - 3 weeks to help form well-vascularised tissue over the spongy bone, which is then covered by full-thickness skin graft to promote healing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depending on the severity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> hand, numerous surgical procedures can be performed together at one and the same session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is a simplified method in which the thumb is also straightened either during the same intervention or at a later date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach is explained with the help of three of our cases </plain></SENT>
