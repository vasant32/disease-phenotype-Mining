<SENT sid="1" pm="?"><plain>What factors differ between patients requiring and those not requiring surgical airway intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>What factors predispose to the need for tracheotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="?"><plain>When can decannulation be expected if tracheotomy is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>What interventions aid decannulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Five-year retrospective chart review at tertiary center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two hundred fifty-one patients met the following entry criteria: enrollment in the New York University Institute of Reconstructive and Plastic Surgery's Craniofacial Clinic and admission to Tisch Hospital in Manhattan for surgery from 1990 to 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hospital, clinic, and departmental office records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had major craniofacial bony anomalies and underwent administration of general anesthesia at least once </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nearly 20% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children required tracheotomy (47/251) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Craniofacial <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>, Pfeiffer, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>) had the highest rate of tracheotomy (48% [28/59]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mandibulofacial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013393" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysostoses</z:e> patients (Treacher Collins or Nager syndrome) had the next highest rate (41% [28/59]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with oculo-auriculo-vertebral sequence were less likely to undergo tracheotomy (22% [9/41]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> rarely required a surgical airway, unless there was marked associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>facial dysmorphism</z:hpo> (1% [1/72]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The duration of cannulation was related to the age at tracheotomy in a bimodal distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Generally, tracheotomies required before age 4 years remained for several years, whereas those placed after age 4 were removed after several weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> correlated with reduced risk for tracheotomy, but the presence of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt correlated with an increased risk for tracheotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Procedures selectively used to improve the airway included midface advancement, mandibular expansion, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, anterior tongue reduction, and endoscopic tracheal granuloma excision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood for surgical airway management is related to specific craniofacial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The length of tracheal cannulation is greatest for infants and young children who manifest severe airway compromise, often because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001742'>nasal obstruction</z:hpo> in combination with other anatomic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Early tracheotomy is advocated for these patients to promote optimal growth and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000453'>Choanal atresia</z:hpo> is often misdiagnosed in these infants; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001742'>nasal obstruction</z:hpo> is actually secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011800'>midface retrusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Staged surgical interventions can allow eventual successful decannulation in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of craniofacial syndromes </plain></SENT>
