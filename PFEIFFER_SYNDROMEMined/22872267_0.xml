<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is caused by gain-of-function mutations in FGFR2, over 98% of which are the two amino acid substitution mutations S252W and P253R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FGFR2 is widely expressed throughout development, so that many tissues are adversely affected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>, particularly the calvarial bones, which begin to fuse during embryonic development, and the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Mouse models of both of these two causative mutations and a third rare splice mutation have been created and display many of the phenotypes typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> phenotypes have begun to be elucidated, and proof-of-principle treatment of these phenotypes by chemical inhibitor and gene-based therapies has been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
