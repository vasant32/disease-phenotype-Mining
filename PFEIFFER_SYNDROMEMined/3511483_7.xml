<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> underwent early surgical intervention (mean age 8.4 months) as part of a staged program of digital separation leading to completion of both hands by the age of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of major complications was low, rate of revision (18 percent) acceptable, and the aesthetic result very satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-term functional results tend to reflect the effect of progressive intrinsic disease despite preservation of skeletal alignment and digital form with growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the aesthetic improvement and potential for greater functional gains at a young age support the concept of early surgical intervention in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
