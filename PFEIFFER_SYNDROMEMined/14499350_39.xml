<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of either Ser252Trp or Pro253Arg in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) are responsible for nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> known cases of AS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that mutant mice carrying the activation mutation, Ser252Trp [corrected] which corresponds to Ser252Trp in human FGFR2, have malformations mimicking the skull abnormalities found in AS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutant mice (Fgfr2(250/+)) are smaller in body size with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000248'>brachycephaly</z:hpo> and exhibit distorted skulls with widely spaced eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, the premature closure of the coronal suture is accompanied by decreased, rather than increased, bone formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the Fgfr2-Ser252Trp [corrected] mutation does not cause obvious alterations in cell proliferation and differentiation; however, it results in increased Bax expression and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of osteogenic cells in mutant coronal suture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accelerated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> possibly reduces the space between osteogenic fronts of flat bones and results in the physical contact of these bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data reveal that dysregulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AS related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
