<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the conventional fronto-orbital advancement method, there is a limit to advancement because of scalp skin tension and an absence of a supraorbital bar fixating point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a case of insufficient advancement after the primary operation, a secondary re-advancement must be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In such a condition, additional fronto-orbital advancement by distraction osteogenesis has proved to be very useful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors used additional distraction osteogenesis in three infant cases: two of nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and one of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were able to perform these operations safely using their original internal devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distraction was started 3 days after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of advancement was 0.5 to 1.0 mm per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distraction distances ranged from 16 to 22 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were able to gain enough advancement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A reoperation of a fronto-orbital advancement is more difficult than the primary operation because of possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, much loss of blood, low blood supply to advanced bones, a tendency of advanced bones to relapse, increased scalp skin tension, and the existence of bone defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these poor conditions, distraction osteogenesis has many advantages: good vascularization, no relapsing, a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate, and no need for bony fixating points in the bone defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although it is necessary to have a secondary operation to remove the devices and prolonged hospitalization is required, the disadvantages are far outweighed by the many advantages when performing additional fronto-orbital advancement </plain></SENT>
