<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The accurate and reproducible determination of the three dimensional (3D) co-ordinate positions of anatomical landmarks from computer tomography (CT) images has been limited even though potentially the data have been available for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper describes a method of acquisition of osseous landmark positions using an off-line computing technique based on multiple stereo images of 3D CT reconstructions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of stereo pairs greatly enhances the consistent identification of osseous landmarks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further, the technique is of particular value where access to the CT scanner is restricted due to heavy clinical demand and separate high quality graphics facilities are unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Osseous landmark position data were determined for dried skulls and patients with craniofacial conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accuracies of the order 1.7mm (median) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results encourage the use of the technique for acquisition of landmark positions for the study of the craniofacial complex in three dimensions </plain></SENT>
