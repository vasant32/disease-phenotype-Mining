<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the feet in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes resulting from mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene have anomalies at many other sites within the feet, which raised the possibility that there may also be a wider range of anomalies other than broad big toes in the feet of those with Pfeiffer's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to assess prospectively the incidence and pattern of clinical and radiographic anomalies of the feet of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pfeiffer's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two Pfeiffer's syndrome patients were examined both clinically and radiologically for anomalies of the feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical examination revealed broad big toes in 12 patients and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001159'>syndactyly</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiographs of the feet were evaluated by a radiologist with an interest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002652'>skeletal dysplasia</z:hpo> as well as by members of the Craniofacial team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A wider range of radiological than clinical anomalies involving the phalanges, metatarsals, and tarsals was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The severity of the anomalies observed ranged from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to those resembling the feet of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 4 patients had radiologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These radiographic findings suggest that there is a range of foot anomalies more extensive than the broad big toes, which are classically associated with Pfeiffer's syndrome </plain></SENT>
