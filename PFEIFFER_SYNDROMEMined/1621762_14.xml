<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Radiographs of the cervical spine--in many cases longitudinal--were available for study in 68 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autopsy material was available in one of these cases, and a 3-dimensional reconstruction from a CT scan was also studied in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Variable degrees of fusion were observed, involving the articular facets, the neural arch or transverse processes, or block fusion of the vertebral bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ossification may not always be evident in some early radiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, early radiographic signs of impending fusion may be irregularity in vertical orientation of the vertebral bodies and narrowing of the involved intervertebral spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cervical fusions occurred in 68%, single fusions being found in 37%, and multiple fusions in 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C5-C6 fusion was most common, alone or in combination with other fusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cervical fusions are known to occur in 25% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> patients, most commonly involving C2-C3 only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It appears that when fusions are present, C5-C6 involvement in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and C2-C3 involvement in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> separate the 2 conditions in most cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because cervical anomalies may complicate an already compromised airway in any form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1510455" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">acrocephalosyndactyly</z:e>, it is imperative to initiate radiographic study of the cervical spine before undertaking anesthesia for surgery </plain></SENT>
