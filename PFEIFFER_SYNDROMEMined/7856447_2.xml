<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients were thoroughly evaluated at the Department of Otolaryngology by polysomnography (PSG), cephalometric X-ray and nasopharyngoscopy during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 4 of the patients PSG showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> syndromes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Heavy snoring without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and paradoxical respiration were noted in the other 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients had sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBD) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cephalometric analysis and profilogram showed maxillomandibular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> in each patient, and it was assumed that the main cause of SRBD in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e> was stenosis of the upper airway tract caused by maxillo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>mandibular hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nasopharyngoscopy was performed during sleep in 2 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OSAS</z:e> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CFS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
