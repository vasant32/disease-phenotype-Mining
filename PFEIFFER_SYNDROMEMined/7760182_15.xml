<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The presence of hindbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e>, abnormal cervical segmentation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003414'>atlantoaxial subluxation</z:hpo> illustrate the anatomical complexity of the skull base and the craniocervical junction that may coexist in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unavoidable division of occipital emissary veins during elevation of the skin flap at the time of vault remodeling surgery led to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and, ultimately, fatal rise in intracranial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postmortem examination and review of magnetic resonance imaging revealed an anomalous pattern of venous drainage of the intracranial structures that appeared to have developed in response to venous obstruction, secondary to intraosseous venous sinuses and stenosis of the jugular foramina </plain></SENT>
