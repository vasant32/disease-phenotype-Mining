<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although outcome data are available from several craniofacial centers, information regarding perioperative and immediate postoperative course is scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes seven children, aged 4 to 17 years, with syndromal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in need of midface advancements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most were rather complex cases with several previous craniofacial surgeries (mean 4.4 times, range 1-8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Modular Internal Distraction System (Howmedica Leibinger, Inc., Rutherford, NJ) was used for the gradual Le Fort III advancements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average midface advancement obtained was 23 mm (range 15-30 mm), resulting in improved facial profile, normalized or improved dental occlusion, reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo>, and cessation or a significant decrease in preoperative respiratory problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean length of operation was 354 minutes (range 300-535 minutes), and the mean amount of perioperative blood transfusion needed was 1251 mL (range 450-1800 mL) or 46.0 mL/kg (range 8.2-121.4 mL/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complications included subcutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> inferolaterally to the eye (N = 3) and forehead (N = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient had worsening of her facial profile and underwent a subsequent fronto-orbital advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed a deviation of the nasal septum and needed a corrective rhinoplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient developed marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000211'>trismus</z:hpo> and one needed reoperation and trimming of the anchoring <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> plate on the malar process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the lacrimal sac was lacerated, leading to transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0009926'>epiphora</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In most patients, Le Fort III distraction led to a significant improvement in the facial profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, surgery is still a major undertaking, with several potential complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In our hands, the rate of complications is not less than for monobloc advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, the choice of operation method is not based on which method is the least risky but on which is best suited for the individual patient </plain></SENT>
