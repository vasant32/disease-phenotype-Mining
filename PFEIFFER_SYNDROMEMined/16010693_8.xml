<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whilst the role of FGFR2 mutations in congenital syndromes has been well documented, their relationship with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> has not been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on evidence that gain-of-function mutations in FGFR2 drive positive selection in adult spermatogonia, the present study investigated, by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), DNA sequencing, and restriction digestion, the prevalence of FGFR2 mutations in 58 tumour cell lines of various types, and 29 testicular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205851" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">germ cell tumour</z:e> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although sequence variations and allelic imbalance were identified in FGFR2, none of the previously documented dominant mutations was detected in any of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> types examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suggests that gain-of-function FGFR2 mutations are not commonly encountered in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1326912" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumourigenesis</z:e> and specifically excludes a major contribution in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039590" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
