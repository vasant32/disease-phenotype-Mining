<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this study we have analysed the distribution of twist transcripts during rat palatogenesis in vivo from 14.5 to 17.5 days post coitum by in situ hybridisation with digoxygenin-labelled ssDNA probes. twist transcripts were found to be concentrated in mesenchymal cells beneath the epithelium at the tip of the palatal shelves immediately prior to, and during fusion as well as in a localised epithelial area at the tip of the shelves prior to fusion, thereby implicating twist gene expression in the process of palatogenesis </plain></SENT>
