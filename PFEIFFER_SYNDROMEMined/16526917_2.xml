<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the first report on a three-generation family presenting typical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, in which the Q289P mutation in the FGFR2 gene was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Dysmorphological evaluation was performed by a clinical geneticist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified coding region of TWIST and screening for the P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exons IIIa and IIIc of FGFR2 were sequenced also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation was confirmed by both restriction-enzyme digestion and allelic-specific polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neither TWIST gene analysis nor analysis of the P250R mutation on gene FGFR3 showed mutation within the coding sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A nucleotide change from CAG to CCG in exon IIIa of the FGFR2 gene that caused a Q289P mutation was detected, although exon IIIc in the propositus was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These same results were detected in his mother, but no other members of the kindred presented clinical features consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This mutation was previously reported in individuals with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795998" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="JWS">Jackson-Weiss syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The FGFR2 mutation in the family with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> herein reported reinforces the idea of an interaction among TWIST and FGFR genes during development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Absence of the Q289P mutation in some affected individuals in this family is discussed </plain></SENT>
