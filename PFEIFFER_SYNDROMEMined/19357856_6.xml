<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relative incidence and management modalities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> hospitalized at the Craniofacial Unit of Necker, French National Referral Center for Faciocraniosynostosis, in two different quinquennia: 1985-1989 (group A) and 2003-2007 (group B) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 1,286 children were included in our study; group A 472, group B 814, that is an overall increase of 1.7-fold in the second period of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> remained the most frequent type (45% of cases in both groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the number of cases of Pfeiffer syndrome increased from seven patients to 20 (x2.8) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011330'>metopic synostosis</z:hpo> cases increased from 49 to 193 (x3.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean age at surgery in group A was 22.5 months and 13 months in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The comparison of the two quinquennia shows that there has been a change in the incidence of the different types of <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The timing for surgery has also changed with the treatment of younger children in group B compared to group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The principles of the surgical treatment of monosutural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> have remained unmodified in our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, there has been an evolution in the techniques due to the introduction of new tools such as internal and external distractions, springs, and resorbable plates </plain></SENT>
