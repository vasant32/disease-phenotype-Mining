<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Since the introduction of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) in 1997, it has been used successfully in treating difficult wounds, including spinal wounds and wounds in pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are no reports on VAC therapy in pediatric patients on the scalp, especially with exposed dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report describes a 10-year-old boy with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> wound of the scalp with exposed dura after multiple neurosurgical interventions who was treated successfully with VAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 10-year-old mentally disabled boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> suffered from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> wound with community-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6827">methicillin</z:chebi>-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> after multiple neurosurgeon operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For wound closure, VAC therapy was initiated on the bony defect with exposed dura </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The wound healed successfully, and the MRSA disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The aims of VAC therapy are formation of new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath>, wound cleansing, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, the VAC device was excellent for temporary coverage of the defect and for wound cleaning, and it allowed a thick bed of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_183'>granulation tissue</z:mpath> to form over the dura, even with minimal constant negative pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The application and management were feasible even in a mentally disabled child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With this experience, we are encouraged to use the VAC device in difficult wounds, even in the head and neck area in children, and to bring this treatment into the outpatient clinic </plain></SENT>
