<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using image processing software, we measured the effect of monobloc advancement on the position of the upper and lower eyelids as well as the palpebral fissure slant in a series of 18 patients with syndromal faciocraniosynostosis who had undergone surgery for correction of orbital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For both eyes of each patient, 3 variables were measured on the pre- and postoperative photographs: the linear distances between the upper and lower eyelid margins, the pupil center and the angle between the inner and outer canthi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The globe protrusion was also measured on axial computed tomography scans before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the exorbitism reduction induced by monobloc advancement is accompanied by a diminution of the distance between both eyelids and the pupil center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the downward slant of the palpebral fissure is increased after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that the lower and upper <z:mp ids='MP_0006166'>eyelid retraction</z:mp> seen preoperatively in the majority of patients with faciocraniosynostosis tend to be corrected when the frontofacial region is advanced by the monobloc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the surgery tends to lower the outer canthus, increasing the negative slant of the fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative changes induced by the frontofacial monobloc advancement need to be taken into account when the surgery is going to be performed </plain></SENT>
