<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations of RAB23, encoding a small GTPase that regulates vesicular transport, are present in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a disorder caused by mutations in multiple epidermal-growth-factor-like-domains 8 (MEGF8), which exhibits substantial clinical overlap with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e> but is frequently associated with abnormal left-right patterning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe five affected individuals with similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001999'>dysmorphic facies</z:hpo>, and three of them had either complete <z:mp ids='MP_0002766'>situs inversus</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001651'>dextrocardia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001669'>transposition of the great arteries</z:hpo>; similar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001627'>cardiac abnormalities</z:hpo> were previously identified in a mouse mutant for the orthologous Megf8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutant alleles comprise one nonsense, three missense, and two splice-site mutations; we demonstrate in zebrafish that, in contrast to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> protein, the proteins containing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three missense alterations provide only weak rescue of an early gastrulation phenotype induced by Megf8 knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that mutations in MEGF8 cause a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275078,C1305108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Carpenter syndrome</z:e> subtype frequently associated with defective left-right patterning, probably through perturbation of signaling by hedgehog and nodal family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We did not observe any subject with biallelic loss-of function mutations, suggesting that some residual MEGF8 function might be necessary for survival and might influence the phenotypes observed </plain></SENT>
