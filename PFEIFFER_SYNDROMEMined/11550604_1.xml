<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The success of LeFort III-osteotomy with concurrent advancement of the midface in cases of severe, midfacial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> is limited by the soft covering tissue of the facial skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There appear to be significant advantages in using distraction osteogenesis of the midface after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We discuss the use of an extraoral distraction device after the osteotomy of a 10-year-old girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's disease</z:e>. and the use of an internal device for a 6-year-old boy with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000272'>midface hypoplasia</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both patients a significant improvement of function, as well as harmonisation of the facial proportions, could be observed and the preoperatively planned distances of midface advancement of 18 and 15 mm respectively could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Distraction osteogenesis is an established procedure for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>mandibular hypoplasia</z:hpo> but few reports dealing with complex midface distraction are available outside of the specialist English language literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We report on both external and internal distraction techniques with which good functional and aesthetic results were achieved </plain></SENT>
