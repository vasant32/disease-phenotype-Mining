<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> show <z:hpo ids='HP_0000316'>hypertelorism</z:hpo> and midfacial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, and their features are significantly improved through facial bipartition surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, because patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> demonstrate cranial deformity as well as other deformities, they require multiple surgical interventions throughout their development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present herein a girl with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> for whom subcranial facial bipartition was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We could not use the coronal approach because she had a terribly cicatricial scalp and wide calvarial defects caused by previous cranial surgeries carried out at another institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we used the glabellar reverse V-shaped approach and temporal approaches in place of the standard approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She enjoyed a complication-free intraoperative and postoperative course, and left the hospital on postoperative day 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her midfacial segment was repositioned 6 mm anteriorly and 12 mm inferiorly on the cephalometric measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her interpupillary distance was altered from 83 mm preoperatively to 76 mm postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reverse V-shaped glabellar approach permits more relaxation of the nasal skin and nasal augmentation that is more reliable, although an inconspicuous scar remains in the prominent area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The temporal approach is also useful, enabling easy zygomatic arch osteotomy and secure pterygo-maxillary separation for pterygo-maxillary separation through an oral approach, allowing chiseling toward the skull base </plain></SENT>
