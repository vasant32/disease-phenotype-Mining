<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To identify visual field deficits in a group of children with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Kinetic visual field examination and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were recorded in 16 children with syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> as part of their ophthalmic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VEPs were analyzed for inter-hemispheric asymmetries and component amplitude and latency, while visual fields were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> were found to have visual field deficits compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> group, deficits tended to involve the nasal field, while infero-nasal field deficits were the most consistent finding in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children with Pfeiffer's demonstrated the greatest deficits, with severe constrictions affecting the whole visual field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEPs were asymmetrical in four cases while the P100 component was subnormal in ten of the 16 patients for either amplitude and/or latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although we may speculate about the mechanisms that cause visual field deficits, we currently are unable to explain the reason for the differing types and extent of visual field loss in the different syndromic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We can conclude that the visual field deficits do indicate previous or ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visual dysfunction</z:e> that cannot be monitored employing central vision tests alone </plain></SENT>
