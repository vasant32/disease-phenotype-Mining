<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> (n = 11), and Pfeiffer (n = 2) (11 female, 4 male) syndrome were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had serial posteroanterior cephalograms at 5, 10, and 15 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bicondylar width, bigonial width, bicondylar/bigonial ratio, and ramus to intercondylar plane angle for each patient were measured on the cephalograms and compared with age-match controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An analysis of variance analysis was carried out to detect differences between patients and controls and sex differences between patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both male and female patients, there was a statistically significant reduction in bicondylar width compared with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male patients also had a statistically significant increase in bigonial width compared with controls and female patients at 10 and 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resulting bicondylar/bigonial ratios were significantly reduced, and the ramus to intercondylar plane angles were significantly increased in both male and female patients compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unlike previous reports of patients with syndromic <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp>, this study demonstrates that the mandible has significant morphologic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001507'>growth abnormalities</z:hpo>, including constriction of bicondylar width with near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bigonial width in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a narrowing at the cranial base with resulting restriction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transverse mandibular growth at the condyle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The secondary nature of the mandibular finding is suggested by the near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased transverse growth at the gonion in females and males, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the ramus appears torqued inward, forming a greater angle with the cranial base </plain></SENT>
