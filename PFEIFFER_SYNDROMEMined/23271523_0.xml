<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case series review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients, treated by a single surgeon, including phenotypic variations, mutational analyses, developmental assessments, and surgical treatments, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, 135 Apert syndrome patients were treated (32 percent from birth) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A fairly even distribution of mutations was noted (S252W, n = 20; P253R, n = 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 268 hands, 60 percent were type I, 21 percent were type II, and 19 percent were type III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent had palatal anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three separate skull configuration types were identified, and 29 percent had acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002308'>Chiari malformations</z:hpo>, 24 percent had anomalies of the septum pellucidum, and 12 percent had anomalies of the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cranial and midfacial procedures were performed significantly earlier at outside centers (6.2 months versus 12.6 months, and 5.3 years versus 7.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant correlations were noted between development and gene mutation, hand or skull phenotypes, intracranial anomalies, and timing of initial skull surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant correlation was noted between adverse development and ventriculoperitoneal shunts, tracheostomies, and more operative interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Higher development strongly correlated with treatment at our center from birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment goals focused on the prevention of avoidable developmental delays (from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010535'>sleep apnea</z:hpo>) and reducing operative interventions may potentially improve developmental outcomes </plain></SENT>
