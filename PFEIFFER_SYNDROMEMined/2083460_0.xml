<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 78% the healing was uneventful and the osteoplasty remained in place whereas in 22% (= 6 animals) we observed a local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> which lead to loss of implants as well as cranioplasty in 3 animals </plain></SENT>
