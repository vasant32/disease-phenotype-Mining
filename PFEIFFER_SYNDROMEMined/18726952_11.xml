<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two heterozygous gain-of-function substitutions (Ser252Trp and Pro253Arg) in exon IIIa of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) are responsible for &gt;98% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe two novel mutations in FGFR2 in the two patients in whom a mutation had not previously been found in our cohort of 227 AS cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first is a 1.93-kb deletion, removing exon IIIc and substantial portions of the flanking introns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first large FGFR2 deletion described in any individual with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The other mutation is a 5' truncated Alu insertion into exon IIIc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the third Alu insertion identified in AS; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have occurred within an interval of only 104 bp, representing an enrichment of over a million-fold compared to the background genomic rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We show that the inserted Alu element belongs to a small subfamily, not previously known to be mobile, which we term Alu Yk13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the deletion and insertion are likely to act by a similar gain-of-function mechanism in which disruption of exon IIIc leads to illegitimate mesenchymal expression of an FGFR2 spliceform containing the alternatively spliced exon IIIb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the AS-associated Alu insertions have arisen in the paternal germline; we propose that their enrichment in FGFR2 is driven by positive selection of the mutant spermatogonial progenitors, a mechanism analogous to that explaining why the canonical AS nucleotide substitutions also reach exceptionally high levels in sperm </plain></SENT>
