<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cranial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001155'>hand anomalies</z:hpo> have been investigated, and the management of these is well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the anomalies affecting the feet and their management has previously received little attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-three children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> underwent investigation of the anomalies affecting their feet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This consisted of history, clinical examination, and where possible, radiographic examination to establish the anomalies present, how these altered during development, and their clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The conclusion of the study is that there are widespread anomalies of the feet, with defects including both predictable dysmorphic changes and progressive fusions of the skeletal components during skeletal maturity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These fusions and their effect on growth combine to produce increasing deformity during childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical significance of the anomalies is that walking is often delayed, and the increasing deformity results in difficulty obtaining footwear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This is the most common reason for surgery to the feet being undertaken during childhood to improve the shape of the feet to facilitate the provision of footwear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The unexpectedly high incidence of surgery in this study suggests that the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001760'>foot deformities</z:hpo> may require surgery more frequently than current literature would suggest </plain></SENT>
