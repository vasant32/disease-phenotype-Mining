<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The same consecutive series of patients had been previously evaluated for stability of Le Fort III advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were assessed at least one year post operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stability of the advancement was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, various midline bony and soft tissue profile measurements were obtained from lateral cephalograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These measurements were compared to similar measurements (standards) in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>. "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath>" standards and "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" appearance imply harmonious and aesthetically pleasing facial features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study showed markedly abnormal positions of the selected bony and soft tissue landmarks preoperatively compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but following surgery the measurements studied approached or were similar to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these measurements, the patient's appearance improved significantly following reconstructive craniofacial surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Suggestions for additional surgery based on these studies are made </plain></SENT>
