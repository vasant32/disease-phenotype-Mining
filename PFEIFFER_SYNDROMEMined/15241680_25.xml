<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This frequently occurs as a new mutation, manifesting one of the highest documented rates for any transversion in the human genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the biology of this mutation, we have investigated its parental origin, and the ages of the parents, in 19 families with de novo c.749C&gt;G mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ten informative cases originated from the paternal allele (95% confidence interval 74-100% paternal); the average paternal age at birth overall was 34.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An exclusive paternal origin of mutations, and increased paternal age, were previously described for a different mutation (c.1138G&gt;A) of the FGFR3 gene causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e>, as well as for mutations of the related FGFR2 gene causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> and Pfeiffer syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that similar biological processes are likely to shape the occurrence of this c.749C&gt;G mutation as for other mutations of FGFR3 as well as FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
