<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is little information on the frequency of palatal clefts in the FGFR2-mediated disorder, that is, Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of palatal clefts in patients with Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The records of patients with Pfeiffer syndrome managed in our craniofacial unit were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pfeiffer syndrome were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria were as follows: characteristic mutations in FGFR1 or FGFR2 or, in the absence of genetic testing, clinical findings consistent with Pfeiffer syndrome as determined by a clinical geneticist or our most experienced surgeon (J.B.M.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 2 clefts were noted in 25 patients (8%), including 1 with a submucous cleft and 1 with an overt palatal cleft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many patients (87%) were described as having a high-arched and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000189'>narrow palate</z:hpo>, and 1 had a low, <z:mp ids='MP_0003759'>broad palate</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were noted to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000453'>choanal atresia or stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clefting of the palate does occur in Pfeiffer syndrome but at a low frequency </plain></SENT>
