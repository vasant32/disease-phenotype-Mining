<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 51 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon's syndrome</z:e>, 33 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e>, 8 with Pfeiffer syndrome, 11 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e>, and 4 with kleebl√§ttschadel anomaly </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Raised ICP was considered in those children who returned with a bulging fontanelle, progressive frontal bone protrusion, intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000737'>irritability</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of raised ICP was based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001085'>papilledema</z:hpo> (four patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004481'>progressive macrocephaly</z:hpo> (one patient), and ICP monitoring (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No child in this group had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> requiring cerebrospinal fluid diversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Once raised ICP was detected in these children, a second operation was immediately performed to reduce the ICP with the intention of expanding the volume of the cranial cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The second procedures included: anterior cranial vault and upper orbital reshaping (four patients), posterior cranial vault reshaping (one patient), and total cranial vault reshaping (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative complications in these patients, although one patient showed subsequent recurrence of raised ICP requiring further cranial vault re-expansion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, ranging from 3 to 7 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients were asymptomatic without evidence of raised ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our series, raised ICP occurred in 6% of the children with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004439'>craniofacial dysostosis</z:hpo> syndrome after initial suture release and decompression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
