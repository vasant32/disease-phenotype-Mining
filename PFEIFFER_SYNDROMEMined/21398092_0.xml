<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Often additional corrective orthognathic surgery is indicated to achieve Class I occlusion and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> inter-jaw relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the incidence of, and the surgical indications for, secondary orthognathic surgery following Le Fort III/monobloc advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total study group consisted of 41 patients: 36 patients with Le Fort III advancement and 5 patients with monobloc advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent additional orthognathic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the resulting 18 non-operated patients older than 18 years at the end of follow-up, Class I occlusion was observed in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the remaining patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000689'>malocclusions</z:hpo> were dentally compensated with orthodontic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients was scheduled for additional orthognathic surgery due to the absence of functional complaints and/or resistance to additional surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Le Fort III and monobloc advancement aim to correct skeletal deformities on the level of zygoma, orbits, nasal area and forehead, but Class I occlusion is frequently not achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Additional orthognathic surgery is often indicated in patients undergoing Le Fort III or monobloc advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Naso-endoscopic analysis of the upper airway and the outcomes of sleep studies may influence the orthognathic treatment plan </plain></SENT>
