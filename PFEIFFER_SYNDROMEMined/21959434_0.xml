<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The three-dimensional guide is based on a three-dimensional rapid prototyping model and provides the three-dimensional spatial orientation and depth for the frontonasal osteotome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method was applied to a 7-year-old patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This technique allowed a critical osteotomy path in Le Fort III surgery to be transferred in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way from the three-dimensional rapid prototyping model to the operating room </plain></SENT>
