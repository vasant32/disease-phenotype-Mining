<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twist1 has been shown to play both positive and negative roles in mesenchymal specification and differentiation, and here we show that the activity of Twist1 is dependent on its dimer partner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twist1 forms both homodimers (T/T) and heterodimers with E2A E proteins (T/E) and the relative level of Twist1 to the HLH inhibitor Id proteins determines which dimer forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the expression patterns of Twist1 and Id1 within the cranial sutures, we hypothesized that Twist1 forms homodimers in the osteogenic fronts and T/E heterodimers in the mid-sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In support of this hypothesis, we have found that genes regulated by T/T homodimers, such as FGFR2 and periostin, are expressed in the osteogenic fronts, whereas genes regulated by T/E heterodimers, such as thrombospondin-1, are expressed in the mid-sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ratio between these dimers is altered in the sutures of Twist1+/- mice, favoring an increase in homodimers and an expansion of the osteogenic fronts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of interest, the T/T to T/E ratio is greater in the coronal versus the sagittal suture, and this finding may contribute to making the coronal suture more susceptible to fusion due to TWIST haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, we were able to inhibit suture fusion in Twist1+/- mice by modulating the balance between these dimers toward T/E formation, by either increasing the expression of E2A E12 or by decreasing Id expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we have identified dimer partner selection as an important mediator of Twist1 function and provide a mechanistic understanding of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> due to TWIST haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
