<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> has been extensively studied and described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, an area that has not been studied is the dental development of these individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the development of the dentition and compare it with that of unaffected children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There appears to be clinical observations indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000684'>delayed eruption</z:hpo> of the permanent teeth in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective study examined <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> patients from four craniofacial centers who had a panoramic radiograph taken before the age of 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six individuals, 19 boys and 17 girls ranging in age from 4.1 to 15.8 (mean = 9.3) years were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The seven left mandibular permanent teeth, second molar to central incisor, were rated on an eight-stage scale (A-H) using methods described by Demirjian and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0406353" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Goldstein</z:e> (1976) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The stage of each tooth was converted to the corresponding numeric value, and then <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven values were added to obtain a dental maturity score, which corresponded to a dental age, based on the sample of 4500+ <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children of the Demirjian et al. study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The dental age and chronologic age were length of delay was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one of 36 individuals had a dental age lower than their chronologic age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sample, the mean developmental dental delay was 0.96 years (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The range in delay was 0.5 years advanced to 2.9 years delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation to increased age with greater delay in dental development (p &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed our clinical impressions: The results showed a mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> of 0.96 years, with a trend of increasing delay with increased age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This positive correlation found between increased age and increased delay parallels the general growth of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> children, with a greater degree of delay as the child grows older </plain></SENT>
