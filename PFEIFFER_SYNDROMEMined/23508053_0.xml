<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Lefort 3 distraction (LF3D) advances the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> midface, but leaves the concavity seen on "worm's eye" view and the vertical compression of the central midface untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose that Lefort II distraction and simultaneous zygomatic repositioning (LF2ZR) can move the central midface independent of the lateral orbits to treat the facial deformity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three dimensions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper was to determine if LF2ZR results in more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> facial proportions in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> than LF3D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD:: CT scan analyses were performed before and after distraction in patients undergoing LF3D (n=5) and LF2ZR (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Movement of the central compared to lateral face was measured relative to skull base, as well as axial facial ratios (AFR) representing "worm's eye" curvature, and vertical facial ratios (VFR) representing relative vertical facial height on frontal view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unoperated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> (n=5) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n=6) controls were analyzed for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: With LF3D, facial ratios did not change with surgery and remained lower (p&lt;0.01) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the face was advanced, its shape remained abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With LF2ZR the central face advanced 12.8mm and lengthened 12.4mm more than the lateral orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This differential movement changed the abnormal facial ratios that were present before surgery into ratios that were not significantly different from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: Compared to LF3D, LF2ZR normalizes the position and the shape of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> face, resulting in more desirable periorbital and facial balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LF2ZR has replaced LF3D in the treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> midface in our center </plain></SENT>
