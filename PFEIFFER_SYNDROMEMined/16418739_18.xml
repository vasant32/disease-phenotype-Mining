<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Screening a large cohort of 84 patients with clinical features of CS, PS or JW by direct sequencing of genomic DNA, enabled FGFR1, 2 or 3 mutation detection in 79 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations preferentially occurred in exons 8 and 10 of FGFR2 encoding the third Ig loop of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 74 FGFR2 mutations that we identified, four were novel including three missense substitutions causing CS and a 2 bp deletion creating a premature stop codon and producing JW phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five FGFR2 mutations were found in one of the two tyrosine kinase subdomains and one in the Ig I loop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, two FGFR2 mutations creating <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32460">cysteine residues</z:chebi> (W290C and Y340C) caused severe forms of PS while conversion of the same residues into another amino-acid (W290G/R, Y340H) resulted in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e> phenotype exclusively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data provide conclusive evidence that the mutational spectrum of FGFR2 mutations in CS and PS is wider than originally thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Genotype-phenotype analyses based on our cohort and previous studies further indicate that in spite of some overlap, PS and CS are preferentially accounted for by two distinct sets of FGFR2 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A limited number of recurrent amino-acid changes (W290C, Y340C, C342R and S351C) is commonly associated with the most severe Pfeiffer phenotypes of poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
