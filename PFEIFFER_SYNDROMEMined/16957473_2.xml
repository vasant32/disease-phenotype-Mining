<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a four-generation family with an FGFR1 P252R mutation, who have typical hand and feet skeletal features of Pfeiffer syndrome without craniofacial involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the third family in the literature in which no family members have craniofacial features of Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> should not preclude the consideration of FGFR mutation analysis in cases in which digital features are characteristic of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
