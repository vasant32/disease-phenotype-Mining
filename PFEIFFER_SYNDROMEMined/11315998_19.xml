<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that the Ser252Trp fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR-2) mutation in Ap syndrome increases osteoblast differentiation and subperiosteal bone matrix formation, leading to premature calvaria ossification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used the emerging technology of complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray to identify genes that are involved in osteoblast abnormalities induced by the Ser252Trp FGFR-2 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To identify the signaling pathways involved in this syndrome, we used radioactively labeled cDNAs derived from two sources of cellular <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNAs</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi>) for hybridization: control (Co) and mutant Ap immortalized osteoblastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among genes that were differentially expressed, protein kinase Ca (PKC-alpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), and the small <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16750">guanosine</z:chebi>-5'-triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA were increased in FGFR-2 mutant Ap cells compared with Co cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The validity of the hybridization array was confirmed by Northern blot analysis using <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> derived from different cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, immunochemical and Western blot analyses showed that mutant Ap cells displayed increased PKC-alpha, IL-1alpha, and RhoA protein levels compared with Co cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment of Co and Ap cells with the PKC inhibitor calphostin C decreased IL-1alpha and RhoA <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in Ap cells, indicating that PKC is upstream of IL-1alpha and RhoA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEKK), also reduced IL-1alpha and RhoA expression in Ap cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data show that the Ser252Trp FGFR-2 mutation in Ap syndrome induces constitutive overexpression of PKC-alpha, IL-1alpha, and small GTPase RhoA, suggesting a role for these effectors in osteoblast alterations induced by the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cDNA microarray technology appears to be a useful tool to gain information on abnormal gene expression and molecular pathways induced by genetic mutations in bone cells </plain></SENT>
