<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Critical cellular events at the palatal medial edge epithelium (MEE) occur in unperturbed mammalian palatogenesis, the molecular control of which involves a number of growth factors including transforming growth factor beta 3 (TGF beta 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is a monogenic human disorder in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> has been significantly correlated to the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2-Ser252Trp mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the relative expression of these genes in human palatogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of the IgIIIa/b and IgIIIa/c transcript isoforms of FGFR2 and the proteins FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 was studied in situ throughout the temporospatial sequence of human palatal shelf fusion and correlated with the expression of TGF beta 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the immunolocalization of the ligand FGFs 2, 4, and 7 was undertaken together with the intracellular transcription factor STAT1, which is activated by FGFR signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FGFRs are differentially expressed in the mesenchyme and epithelia of fusing palatal shelves, in domains overlapping those of their ligands FGF4 and FGF2 but not FGF7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Coexpression is seen with TGF beta 3, which is implicated in MEE dynamics and FGF and FGFR upregulation, and STAT1, an intracellular transcription factor that mediates <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The coregulation of molecules of the FGFR signaling pathway with TGF beta 3 throughout the stages of human palatal fusion suggests their controlling influence on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and epitheliomesenchymal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_85'>transdifferentiation</z:mpath> at the MEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Experimental evidence links FGFR2-IgIIIa/b loss of function with palatal clefting, and these correlated data suggest a unique pathological mechanism for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
