<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients in a single family showing Pfeiffer syndrome exhibited this unique MCPP profile which was not present in non-affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing relatives were identified as affected by this technique, and this diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by radiographic and genetic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that: 1) the MCPP in Pfeiffer and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Chotzen syndromes</z:e> is unique and can be used to make the diagnosis of an ACS syndrome in persons who show few or no clinical stigmata of disease; 2) the MCPP does not discriminate between these two ACS types </plain></SENT>
