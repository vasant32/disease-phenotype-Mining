<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Over 50 years ago, current tenets of distraction osteogenesis were developed through work on the lower extremity; however, the application of these tenets in the paediatric craniofacial skeleton remains questionable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prompted by recent concern that traditional aspects of distraction may be either outdated or wholly inapplicable to the paediatric maxilla, we retrospectively evaluated maxillary distraction protocol using a 24-h latency period in conjunction with a distraction rate of 2mm/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following maxillary advancement via a distraction protocol consisting of a 24-h latency period and a distraction rate of 2mm/day, seven consecutive paediatric cases were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standard profile photos and cephalometric films taken preoperatively, at device removal and at 1-year follow-up were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With the sella as the point of registration, pre- and post-distraction films were superimposed on the sella-nasion plane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sella-nasion-subspinale, the angle of convexity, the distance from incisal edges to the y-axis, and angulation of the upper incisor to the sella-nasion plane were analysed to evaluate hard-tissue changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patient age ranged from 3 to 14 years (mean=7.43 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Maxillary distraction length averaged 11 mm (range=10-12 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interval from device application to removal averaged 98 days (range=75-180 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The interval of the active distraction ranged from 11 to 65 days (mean=24 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From distraction completion to device removal averaged 85 days (range=60-150) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up intervals ranged from 52 to 24 months (mean=34 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients demonstrated substantial clinical advancement of the maxilla with correction of midfacial deficiencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A single patient developed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> at one skin-device interface; no other complications were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cephalometric and clinical evaluations at 1 year post-distraction demonstrated stable results, and parental satisfaction was qualitatively high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The surgical dogma of lower-extremity distraction osteogenesis is not absolute and may not be optimal for use in the paediatric maxilla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate effective maxillary correction following application of a 24-h latency period coupled with rapid distraction at 2mm/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our success with a short latency period and more rapid device expanse may be a product of the significant vascularity and improved healing potential of the paediatric maxilla </plain></SENT>
