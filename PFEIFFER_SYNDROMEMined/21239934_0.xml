<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomographic (CT) scans have provided the opportunity to compare with the accuracy of real anatomic changes, thus the functional improvements, resulting after a surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three-dimensional CT scans processed by Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine files in Dolphin 3D software were used to assess the airway space volume in 4 subjects affected by craniofacial syndromic malformations treated with Le Fort III advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The preoperative (T0) and postoperative (T1: 6 mo after surgery) three-dimensional craniofacial CT scans of the subjects were collected and retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Image segmentation of the anatomic structures of interest and the three-dimensional graphic rendering were done by using the Dolphin Imaging Plus 11.0 software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The airway space volume was significantly increased after surgery (mean [SD]: from 9166.57 [1861.48] mm to 15,300.45 [5114.09] mm; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sagittal surfaces had an expansion from 798.92 (74.88) to 1151.45 (218.47) mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The coronal surfaces grew from 226.75 (62.85) to 390.42 (102.21) mm, and axial surfaces increased 473.32 (62.34) to 676.00 (151.07) mm from T0 to T1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study showed an increase in the upper airway space volume in white subjects after Le Fort III advancement </plain></SENT>
