<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> syndromes, Pfeiffer syndrome is notable because of high mortality and the need for multiple surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is variable in severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We propose a new classification of Pfeiffer Syndrome to define pathology and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review was conducted of 42 patients with Pfeiffer syndrome treated from 1975 to 2010, the largest series reported to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The classification was based on a functional assessment of patients in terms of respiratory, ocular, otological, and neurological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This classification was tested by scoring and stratifying patients as follows: type A (mild problems), B (moderate problems), or C (severe problems) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were scored both at the time of presentation and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surgical interventions to assess change in functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The functional classification system was compared to another previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Type A patients did not have any change in postoperative functional outcomes (mean preoperative score 1.6, mean postoperative score 1.6); type B patients showed functional improvement (mean preoperative score 4.1, mean postoperative score 3.4) but type C patients (mean preoperative score 7.7, mean postoperative score 4.8) demonstrated the greatest improvement in functional scores after surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Suture pathology did not indicate the clinical severity of phenotype, a variance from a previously published classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The proposed classification is useful to assess severity of phenotype: respiratory, ocular, otologic, and neurologic problems are key indicators of the need for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The classification can provide a helpful guide in multidisciplinary treatment planning, in reporting outcomes, and in the sharing of data among craniofacial anomalies centers </plain></SENT>
