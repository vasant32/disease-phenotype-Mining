<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo> and is primarily caused by FGFR2 +/P253R and +/S252W mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The former mutation is present in approximately one third whereas the latter mutation is present in two-thirds of the patients with this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported an inbred transgenic mouse model with the Fgfr2 +/S252W mutation on the C57BL/6J background for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we present a mouse model for the Fgfr2+/P253R mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We generated inbred Fgfr2(+/P253R) mice on the same C56BL/6J genetic background and analyzed their <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3D micro-CT scans of the skulls of the Fgfr2(+/P253R) mice revealed that the skull length was shortened with the length of the anterior cranial base significantly shorter than that of the Fgfr2(+/S252W) mice at P0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Fgfr2(+/P253R) mice presented with <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> of the coronal suture and proximate fronts with disorganized cellularity in sagittal and lambdoid sutures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0008271'>Abnormal osteogenesis</z:mp> and proliferation were observed at the developing coronal suture and long bones of the Fgfr2(+/P253R) mice as in the Fgfr2(+/S252W) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinases (MAPK) was observed in the Fgfr2(+/P253R) neurocranium with an increase in phosphorylated p38 as well as ERK1/2, whereas phosphorylated AKT and PKCalpha were not obviously changed as compared to those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were localized phenotypic and molecular variations among individual embryos with different mutations and among those with the same mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our in vivo studies demonstrated that the Fgfr2 +/P253R mutation resulted in mice with cranial features that resemble those of the Fgfr2(+/S252W) mice and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Activated p38 in addition to the ERK1/2 signaling pathways may mediate the mutant neurocranial phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Though <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> is traditionally thought to be a consistent phenotype, our results suggest localized and regional variations in the phenotypes that characterize <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
