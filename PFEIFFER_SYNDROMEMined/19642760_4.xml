<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cardinal features include coronal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>blepharoptosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>Cleft palate</z:hpo> can also occur, but there are few reports on its frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of palatal anomalies in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 51 patients with SCS seen at Children's Hospital Boston over the past 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Palatal findings in our patients were compared with those in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To illustrate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> in SCS, we describe an unusual infant who presented for evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>blepharoptosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Her father had only <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>blepharoptosis</z:hpo>; this was the clue to the diagnosis, which was confirmed by finding a deletion in the TWIST gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo> was noted in 43%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000193'>bifid uvula</z:hpo> in 10%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These figures differed slightly from the combined percentages in published reports: 24% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000156'>high-arched palate</z:hpo>, 2% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000193'>bifid uvula</z:hpo>, and 5% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Palatal anomalies are relatively common in SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000175'>cleft palate</z:hpo>, particularly in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>blepharoptosis</z:hpo>, nasal deviation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002813'>limb abnormalities</z:hpo> in the patient or in family members </plain></SENT>
