<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe an improved highly sensitive method for generating cDNA libraries containing a high proportion of cDNAs enriched with 5'-coding sequences from single human preimplantation embryos and a 10 week old whole foetus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The embryonic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was isolated using oligo-(dT) linked to magnetic beads </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out directly on the bound <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, followed by PCR designed to amplify the cDNA molecules synthesized in their entirety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complexities of the libraries are between 10(5) and 10(6) independent clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average cDNA size is 1.0 kb, and the size range is 0.5-3.0 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR analysis of the embryonic libraries for specific genes has revealed transcripts for genes known to be transcribed in preimplantation stages, such as the imprinted gene SNRPN, developmental genes WNT11, HOX, OCT-1 and the embryonic OCT-4, cytoskeletal genes keratin-18 and beta-actin, the cell cycle gene C-MOS, and housekeeping genes GAPDH and HPRT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of random clones showed the presence of a variety of sequences, such as human chorionic gonadotrophin, ubiquitin, TFIIA, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> nucleotide-binding protein (beta-subunit), annexin I, a gene encoding a kinesin-like protein, and TWIST, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor implicated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0175699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Saethre-Chotzen syndrome</z:e> (characterized by craniofacial and limb anomalies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 40% of these randomly analysed clones were full length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to cDNAs matching known ESTs (Expressed Sequence Tags) in the GenBank and dbEST databases, novel sequences were detected at a frequency of 16% of randomly picked clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The libraries are a valuable resource, providing longer cDNAs representing genes expressed during human preimplantation development </plain></SENT>
