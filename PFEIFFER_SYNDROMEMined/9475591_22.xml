<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied an infant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002676'>cloverleaf skull</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002974'>radioulnar synostosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011304'>broad thumbs</z:hpo> and great toes diagnosed as Pfeiffer syndrome type 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there were many overlapping findings with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265307" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Antley-Bixler syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was found to have a G to T mutation in codon 290 exon 7 of the FGFR2 gene leading to a substitution of a cys for the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> trp at this locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is the third mutation characterized at this codon; therefore, this locus appears to be a mutational hotspot in the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the other known mutations lead to a milder, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon</z:e>-like phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The introduction of an additional cys into a region characterized by immunoglobulin-type loops maintained by cys S-S crosslinking may provide an explanation for the severity of the clinical findings of this child </plain></SENT>
