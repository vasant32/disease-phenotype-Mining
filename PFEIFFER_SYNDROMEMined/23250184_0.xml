<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amount of crowding was 20.4 mm in the maxilla and 6 mm in the mandible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cephalometric analysis revealed a skeletal Class III relationship due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000327'>maxillary hypoplasia</z:hpo> with a dolichofacial growth pattern </plain></SENT>
