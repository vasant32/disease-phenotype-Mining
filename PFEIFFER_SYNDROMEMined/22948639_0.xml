<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we reported the simultaneous Le Fort I, II, and III osteotomies for segmental advancement of midface deficiency involving nasal bones, zygoma, inferior orbital rims, and maxilla in an adult Chinese patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To achieve the ideal advancement of different parts of midface simultaneously, we divided the midface into 4 segments, including nasal bone combined with upper portion of maxilla, lower portion of maxilla, and left and right zygoma, with simultaneous Le Fort I, Le Fort II, and Le Fort III osteotomies, and each segment was repositioned as required respectively to obtain ideal facial aesthetics and favorable occlusion </plain></SENT>
