<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Craniofacial surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> is one of the most challenging reconstructive procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Restoration of particular functional and anatomic requirements is important for development from infancy to adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to present the authors' experience of craniofacial surgery for management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand, addressing the challenges of diagnosis, management and outcomes, which may be adapted in other developing countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: This paper presents the cranial and associated deformities, diagnosis, radiologic findings, preoperative evaluation, craniofacial and maxillary surgeries and outcome(s) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The care team, made up of neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, radiologists, ophthalmologists and pediatricians, established the Tawanchai Center's protocol for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo>, to manage the timing of craniofacial procedures from infancy to adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The physical examination and radiologic findings of three patients, two with sagittal <z:mp ids='MP_0000566'>synostosis</z:mp> and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001357'>plagiocephaly</z:hpo> are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical, craniofacial and maxillofacial surgeries and long-term outcomes of another three patients were studied one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> and two with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the latter three patients were lost to follow-up after the initial post-surgical visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At that time, there were appropriate surgical results vis-a-vis appearance and satisfaction from the perspective of the two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> and their families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Crouzon syndrome</z:e> received <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> education supported by a successful family, while the other was still continuing her studies at school with good progress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> continued to live with his parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional reconstructive surgery is recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Economic problems and lack of adequate information were the main reasons for their discontinuing follow-up appointments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Systematic physical examination and radiologic assessments by the craniofacial team are critically important for diagnosis, evaluation, planning of management and outcome assessment of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In Thailand and other developing countries, the challenges in management of these patients are the development of standard craniofacial surgery, craniofacial team management and well-coordinated care, planned surgeries and outcome assessments from infancy to adolescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A supportive government health system and establishment of a craniofacial center and foundation is needed in order to support and provide proper care for these groups of patients </plain></SENT>
