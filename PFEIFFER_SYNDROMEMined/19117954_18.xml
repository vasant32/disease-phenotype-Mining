<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signaling mechanisms involved in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs are however not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) in osteoblast committment and differentiation of murine mesenchymal C3H10T1/2 cells stably transfected with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) or activated FGFR2 due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> S252W genetic mutation (MT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>WT FGFR2 slightly increased, whereas MT FGFR2 strongly increased, FGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating activation of the receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>WT and MT FGFR2 increased C3H10T1/2 cell proliferation but not survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both WT and MT FGFR2 increased early and late osteoblast gene expression and matrix mineralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forced expression of WT and MT FGFR2 also increased osteoblast gene expression in MC3T3-E1 calvaria osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both cell types, MT FGFR2 was more effective than WT FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, WT and MT FGFR2 decreased adipocyte differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>WT and MT FGFR2 induced ERK1/2 but not JNK or PI3K/AKT phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MT, but not WT, also increased protein kinase C (PKC) activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 prevented cell proliferation induced by WT and MT FGFR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Using dominant-negative ERK and PKCalpha vectors, we demonstrated that WT and MT FGFR2 promoted osteoblast gene expression through ERK1/2 and PKCalpha signaling, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study identifies FGFR2 as a novel regulatory molecule that promotes osteogenic differentiation in murine MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The promoting effect of WT and MT FGFR2 is mediated by ERK1/2 and PKCalpha pathways that play essential and distinct roles in FGFR2-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells </plain></SENT>
