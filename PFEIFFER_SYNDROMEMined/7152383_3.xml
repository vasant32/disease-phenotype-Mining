<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three cases out of five showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100258'>preaxial polydactylies</z:hpo> of the foot, considered to be one of the characteristic features of Carpenter's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the remaining two cases, the first digital ray of the foot was broad and deformed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition one case had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100259'>postaxial polydactyly</z:hpo> of the hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three cases showed severe deformity of the shoulder; two had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and one had synchondrosis of the glenohumeral joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our findings in this, we feel that there is much phenotypic overlap between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e>'s and Carpenter's syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A polydactylous presentation of the hand and foot can be found in not a few cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert's syndrome</z:e> and it is not always an exclusive feature of Carpenter's syndrome </plain></SENT>
