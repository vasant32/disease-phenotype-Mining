<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which such mutations lead to CS have been variously ascribed to increased osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, but it is not always clear how these disturbances relate to the process of suture fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reassessed coronal suture fusion in an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert</z:e> Fgfr2 (S252W) mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find that the critical event of CS is the early loss of basal sutural mesenchyme as the osteogenic fronts, expressing activated Fgfr2, unite to form a contiguous skeletogenic membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A mild increase in osteoprogenitor proliferation precedes but does not accompany this event, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the more apical coronal suture initially forms appropriately but then undergoes fusion, albeit at a slower rate, accompanied by a significant decrease in osteoprogenitor proliferation, and increased osteoblast maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> now accompanies fusion, but is restricted to bone fronts in contact with one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We correlated these in vivo observations with the intrinsic effects of the activated Fgfr2 S252W mutation in primary osteoblasts in culture, which show an increased capacity for both proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggest that the major determinant of Fgfr2-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> is the failure to respond to signals that would halt the recruitment or the advancement of osteoprogenitor cells at the sites where sutures should normally form </plain></SENT>
