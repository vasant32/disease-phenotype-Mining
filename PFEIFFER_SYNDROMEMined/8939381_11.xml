<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective and prospective study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A pediatric tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Nine patients-ranging in age from 2 to 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Hearing levels and middle ear function were assessed using standard procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Otoscopy was also conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography (CT) scans of the temporal bone were obtained to study outer, middle, and inner ear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hearing loss was present in eight of the nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of loss varied but was moderate to severe in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> and one had mixed loss; none had purely sensorineural loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle ear effusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Primary CT findings showed stenosis and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000413'>atresia of the external auditory canal</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the middle ear cavity, and an enlarged middle ear cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ossicles were hypoplastic in a few cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With one exception, inner ear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Otologic malformations and hearing loss are features of Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Major factors contributing to hearing loss were anatomic abnormalities of the external auditory canal and middle ear, which can be identified by computerized tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>Otitis media</z:hpo> was also present and may have caused or contributed to the hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>We recommend that the computerized tomographic study, which is often used to evaluate and plan treatment for the craniofacial skeleton, be extended to include a thorough evaluation of otologic structures in patients with Pfeiffer syndrome </plain></SENT>
