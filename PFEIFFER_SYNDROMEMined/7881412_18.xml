<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined 129 individuals from 11 families with PS and performed linkage studies using microsatellite markers spanning the entire genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Strongest support for linkage was with DNA markers (D8S255, GATA8G08) from chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Obligate crossovers exclude close linkage to this region in six families, and there was significant evidence for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A multipoint lod score of 7.15 was obtained in five families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 11 cM interval between D8S278 and D8S285 contains one gene for PS and also spans the centromere of chromosome 8 </plain></SENT>
