<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> in whom cranial vault expansion was followed by the development of hind-brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This prompted a review of our other cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> who had been evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging following surgery in order to assess the frequency of hind-brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> in these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging had been performed in the postoperative evaluation of 34 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> who had undergone procedures intended to increase the intracranial volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The position of the cerebellar tonsils and the presence or otherwise of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> was recorded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of surgery in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> (ICP) was evaluated by means of postoperative ICP monitoring and had been performed in 22 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Herniation</z:e> of the hind-brain below the level of the foramen magnum was observed in 18 cases (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>Hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, requiring the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, was present in 14 cases (41%) and had developed after the cranial vault procedure in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean sleeping ICP measured postoperatively was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (&lt;10 mm Hg) in 5, borderline (10-15) in 7, and raised (&gt;15 mm Hg) in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cranial vault expansion in complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> may fail to address the underlying aetiology of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> and hind-brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> may develop following such surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither the increase in intracranial volume afforded by cranial vault expansion nor the shunting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> precludes the persistence of abnormal ICP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings are discussed in the light of possible mechanisms, in addition to cephalocranial disproportion responsible for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The implications for the surgical management of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> are reviewed </plain></SENT>
