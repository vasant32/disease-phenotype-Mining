<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a image processing software, we measured on axial computed tomographic scans the effect of monobloc advancement on the correction of exorbitism on a large series of patients (n=38) with syndromal faciocraniosynostosis who underwent surgery for correction of cranial and facial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A population reference of 23 patients without faciocraniosynostoses was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each orbit, globe protrusion was expressed as the ratio between the length of the globe that is above the interzygomatic line and eye size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that monobloc has a symmetrical effect on both eyes that is correlated to the preoperative degree of exorbitism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal data indicate that exorbitism correction changes with time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A mean preoperative globe protrusion of 0.86 dropped sharply to 0.54 at 6 months after distraction and increased to 0.61 at 16 months after distraction removal, a value that is not significantly different from the ratio of the control group (0.60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, the data suggest that a certain degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000663'>enophthalmos</z:hpo> in the early postoperative period does not necessarily imply a sustained overcorrection </plain></SENT>
