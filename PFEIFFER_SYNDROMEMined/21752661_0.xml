<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the influence of Le Fort III advancement on orbital volume, position of the infra-orbital rim and globe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In pre- and post-operative CT-scans of 18 syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001363'>craniosynostosis</z:hpo> patients, segmentation of the left and right orbit was performed and the infra-orbital rim and globe were marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By superimposing the pre- and post-operative scans and by creating a reference coordinate system, movements of the infra-orbital rim and globe were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Orbital volume increased significantly, by 27.2% for the left and 28.4% for the right orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant anterior movements of the left infra-orbital rim of 12.0mm (SD 4.2) and right infra-orbital rim of 12.8mm (SD 4.9) were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant medial movements of 1.7mm (SD 2.2) of the left globe and 1.5mm (SD 1.9) of the right globe were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between anterior infra-orbital rim movement and the increase in orbital volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant orbital volume increase has been demonstrated following Le Fort III advancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The position of the infra-orbital rim was moved forward significantly, whereas the globe position remained relatively unaffected </plain></SENT>
