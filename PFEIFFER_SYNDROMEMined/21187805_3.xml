<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors present a long-term follow-up study reporting both surgical results and psychosocial status of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was performed identifying patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> treated between 1975 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surgical procedures were recorded and a review of psychosocial and educational status was obtained when patients reached adulthood </plain></SENT>
