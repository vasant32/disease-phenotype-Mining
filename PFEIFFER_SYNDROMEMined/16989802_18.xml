<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the role of mesenchymal FGF signaling in the differentiation of the mesenchyme and its impact on epithelial morphogenesis, we took advantage of Fgfr2c(+/Delta) mice, which due to a splicing switch express Fgfr2b in mesenchymal tissues and manifest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e>-like phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a set of in vivo and in vitro studies, we show that an autocrine FGF10-FGFR2b signaling loop is established in the mutant lung mesenchyme, which has several consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It prevents the entry of the smooth muscle progenitors into the smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage and results in reduced fibronectin and elastin deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of Fgf10 expression are raised within the mutant mesenchyme itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Epithelial branching as well as epithelial levels of FGF and canonical Wnt signaling is dramatically reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These defects result in arrested development of terminal airways and an "<z:hpo ids='HP_0002097'>emphysema</z:hpo> like" phenotype in postnatal lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our work unravels part of the complex interactions that govern <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lung development and may be pertinent to understanding the basis of respiratory defects in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
