<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to characterize the otologic and audiologic findings in PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The records of PS patients evaluated at our craniofacial center over a 30-year period were culled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only patients with a confirmed diagnosis and formal audiologic examination were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic criteria were characteristic mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 or 2 (FGFR1, FGFR2) or, in the absence of genetic testing, typical clinical findings of PS as determined by a clinical geneticist or the most senior author </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients met the inclusion criteria, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had traditional audiologic testing: 14 (70%) had pure conductive loss (minor to severe), and 3 (15%) had a mixed conductive/sensorineural loss (minor to severe) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients had hearing loss by Behavioral Observational Audiometry (sound fields method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>conductive hearing loss</z:hpo> was subsequently determined to have a pure sensorineural deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (45%) had permanent hearing loss significant enough to require audiologic amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with PS demonstrated hearing loss, although the severity and the anatomic basis (ie., neural vs conductive) were variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000405'>Conductive hearing loss</z:hpo>, possibly caused by structural abnormalities, was most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>Sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> was less common and may be related to the effect of FGFR mutations on cranial nerve and/or inner-ear development </plain></SENT>
