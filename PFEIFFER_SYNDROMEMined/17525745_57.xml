<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although most women present with early disease confined to the uterus, the majority of persistent or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumors</z:e> are refractory to current chemotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified a total of 11 different FGFR2 mutations in 3/10 (30%) of endometrial cell lines and 19/187 (10%) of primary <z:mp ids='MP_0009222'>uterine tumors</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations were seen primarily in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the endometrioid histologic subtype (18/115 cases investigated, 16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> identified were identical to germline activating mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Apert Syndrome</z:e>, Beare-Stevenson Syndrome, hypochondroplasia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">achondroplasia</z:e> and SADDAN syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> identified were S252W (in eight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>) and N550K (in five samples) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four novel mutations were identified, three of which are also likely to result in receptor gain-of-function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extensive functional analyses have already been performed on many of these mutations, demonstrating they result in receptor activation through a variety of mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The discovery of activating FGFR2 mutations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinoma</z:hpo> raises the possibility of employing anti-FGFR molecularly targeted therapies in patients with advanced or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0012114'>endometrial carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
