<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of measurements was compared when measured on a workstation using a 16-slice multidetector spiral computed tomography and on a stereolithographic model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three different methods of defining distances were investigated: 1) on the stereolithographic plastic models, 14 distances connecting landmarks were identified with a digitizer (Polaris Tracker); 2) the same distances were defined at axial, coronal, and sagittal reformats of the computed tomography data set and measured using a Philips MX View workstation; and 3) the same 14 distances were defined at three-dimensional virtual reality models of the skulls at the same workstation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following conclusions could be drawn: stereolithographic models provide a highly exact reproduction of the skull in children with craniofacial malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They are a reliable basis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analytic and probatory endeavors preparing complicated surgical corrections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional virtual reality display modes serve significantly better for exact distance measurements on the complex surface of the human skull than planar reformats of the same computed tomography data sets </plain></SENT>
