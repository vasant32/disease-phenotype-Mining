DNA ligase IV deficiency syndrome (LIG4 syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, low birth weight, dysmorphic facial findings, immunodeficiency, pancytopenia, and radiosensitivity due to impaired repair of DNA double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining. Herein, we report two siblings with LIG4 syndrome with a novel mutation. One of the siblings, who had normocellular marrow, had autologous reconstitution after initial non-myeloablative conditioning and underwent successful second hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after conditioning with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and anti-thymocyte globulin. Our findings indicate that transplantation with myeloablative conditioning can be used successfully in LIG4 syndrome patients.
