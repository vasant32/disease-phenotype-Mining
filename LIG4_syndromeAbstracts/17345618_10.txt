A 14-year-old Japanese girl with a progressing combined immunodeficiency had developed non-Hodgkin's diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Her molecular analysis showed a compound heterozygote of novel mutations in the LIG4 gene, M249V substitution and a five nucleotides deletion from nucleotide position 1,270-1,274. She had also a set of characteristic clinical features of LIG4 syndrome. Mutations in the LIG4 gene, which plays a critical role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, imply a correlation with malignancies and several cases with leukemia or lymphoma have already been reported. We report here on a case of LIG4 syndrome complicated with distinct EBV-associated B-cell lymphoma.
