The family information from a group of patients with arteriosclerotic cerebral infarction and their matched controls is reported. The prevalence rate for arteriosclerotic cerebral infarction in the first-degree relatives of the cases was higher than that in the first-degree relatives of the controls. The heritability was estimated as 41 +/- 7%. No significant difference of heritability between males and females was found. The subgroup of less than 65 years of age was most closely associated with genetic factor in the three subgroups. These results suggest that genetic factor plays an important role in the etiology of arteriosclerotic cerebral infarction, especially in those with middle ages of onset.
