The authors present some results regarding spontaneous bioelectrical brain activity and EEG reactions in functional loadings seen in 53 patients with oneiroid syndromes of a different nature. In most of the cases there were crude pathological changes in the EEG in the form of a disorganization of bioelectrical activity, unstable and fragmental registrations and intrahemispheric asymmetry of biopotentials. These data are not in correlation with the nozological disorders, type of the oneiroid condition, but are in coordination with the character of emotional-volutional disturbances which accompany dream-like disorders of consciousness. On the basis of stable pathological EEG changes which remain even during remissions, the authors come to the conclusion that these changes reflect the structural-functional disturbances of the brain which is the basis for the development of an oneiroid attack.
