BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Clinically important atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease is mainly found in patients aged >60 years. Transcranial color-coded duplex ultrasonography (TCCD) is a relatively new technique for investigating the basal cerebral arteries; however, it is often hampered by impenetrable ultrasound windows. The aim of this study was to ascertain the as yet unknown success rate of TCCD regarding visualization of the basal cerebral arteries in patients >60 years, to provide reference data, and to compare any possible male/female differences. METHODS: In 112 atherosclerotic white patients >60 years of age, the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries and the vertebral and basilar arteries were insonated. RESULTS: In men, 99% of the temporal and 94% of the suboccipital windows could be penetrated by ultrasound compared with 77% and 95%, respectively, in women. The male versus female vessel detection rates were 91% versus 58% for the anterior cerebral artery, 97% versus 73% for the middle cerebral artery, 97% versus 68% for the posterior cerebral artery, 94% versus 93% for the vertebral artery, and 91% versus 79% for the basilar artery. In 77% of men but only 33% of women could all vascular segments be investigated. All intracranial arteries were insonated at a deeper level in men. The women showed significantly higher blood flow velocities than the men. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly white men the vessel detection rate is >90%. In women there is a much lower detection rate, due to impenetrable temporal windows. Visualization of all major intracranial arteries is possible in only one third of female patients >60 years of age.
