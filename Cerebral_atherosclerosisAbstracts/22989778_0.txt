BACKGROUND: Intracranial atherosclerosis may be the underlying pathology in up to 15% of ischemic strokes, but may account for about 40% of strokes in some populations. After an ischemic event determined by intracranial atherosclerosis, patients have a 12% annual risk of stroke recurrence, mostly during the first year. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate procedural safety, clinical outcome and restenosis rate of Wingspan stent placement. METHODS: Twenty-one caucasoid patients were enrolled. Target patients were affected by high-grade, symptomatic, intracranial atherosclerotic lesions, were on antithrombotic therapy and at high stroke risk. All patients were treated with the Wingspan stent system. RESULTS: Technical success resulted 100%, with all target lesions being reduced to <50%. No stroke or death were observed at 30. The mean percent of stenosis was reduced from a middle value of 84% to a middle value of 17% after stent placement. Medium follow-up was 19.5months (range 6-36months). No stroke or death occurred in any patient. None of the patients presented a <50% stent patency rate at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The short-term results and follow up analysis provide evidence demonstrating the safety of the Wingspan system when used in high-risk patient population. Due to concerns regarding long-term stent patency and ischemic events occurrence emerged from clinical trials such as the SAMMPRIS, intracranial angioplasty and stent with the Wingspan system should be considered only for high risk patients in which it may be considered the only viable therapeutic option.
