 BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality including ischemic stroke. Its final complications are cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis. However, few studies on the relationship between IR and intracranial (IC) atherosclerosis have been reported. METHODS: We analyzed 110 patients with acute stroke without diabetes who underwent brain magnetic resonance angiography and cerebral angiography. Patients were divided into 3 equal groups according to the tertiles of homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR): group I (n = 36; HOMA-IR < 0.92), group II (n = 37; 0.92 <or= HOMA-IR < 1.55), and group III (n = 37; HOMA-IR >or= 1.55). Cerebral artery atherosclerosis was classified as either IC or extracranial (EC). RESULTS: Patients with IC or EC atherosclerosis showed higher level of HOMA-IR than those without. When the association was assessed according to the site of atherosclerosis, HOMA-IR showed a significant association with the site of atherosclerosis (IC + EC > IC > EC, P < .01). Multivariate analysis revealed that HOMA-IR was an independent predictor of IC atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the association between IR and stroke patterns in patients with atherosclerosis remains uncertain, IR is associated with IC atherosclerosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke without diabetes.
