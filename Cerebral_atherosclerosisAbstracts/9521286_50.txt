We studied 100 consecutive acute stroke patients in a Chinese population with transcranial Doppler and CT. Twenty patients had intracerebral hemorrhage and 14 patients did not have adequate temporal windows for transcranial Doppler examination. Among the remaining 66 patients, 22 patients (33%) had intracranial occlusive diseases and 3 (6%) had extracranial carotid stenosis. Our data showed that intracranial occlusive disease is the most commonly found vascular lesion in our acute stroke patients.
