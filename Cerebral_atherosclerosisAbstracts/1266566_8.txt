During the years 1970-1974, a total of 44 patients referred by neurologists to the Urological Laboratory were classified in the following groups: paralysis agitans (27), postencephalitic parkinsonism (5), cerebral arteriosclerosis and parkinsonism (7) and cerebral arteriosclerosis and parkinsonism, suspected (5). Bladder function was assessed on the basis of cystometry and urodynamic investigation. A high frequency of supranuclear bladder paresis (SNP) was found, although unequally distributed in the different diagnostic groups. Stereotactic operations on the thalamic nuclei seemed to be correlated with SNP. The question was raised whether SNP was part of the parkinsonian syndrome or merely signs and symptoms related to ageing.
