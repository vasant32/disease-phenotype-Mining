Literary data on the morphogenesis of prelipid changes in the basal arteries of the brain are scarce. This concerns also data on the antiaggregation activity of the vessel wall in this location. It was established that the antiaggregation activity of the vessel wall depended on the grade of its involvement by the atherosclerotic process. It was found that the higher the prelipid changes the lower was the antiaggregation activity of the vessel wall while the atherosclerotic plaques possess even proaggregation properties.
