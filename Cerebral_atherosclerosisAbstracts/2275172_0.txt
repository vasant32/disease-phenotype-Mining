The authors evaluated the diagnostic importance of morphological properties of thrombocytes in patients with cerebral atherosclerosis. The proposed method consists in vital staining of thrombocytes in the blood plasma by means of acridine arrange, their fixation, application of a smear, microscopy in ultraviolet rays with determination of the ratio of thrombocytes of separate classes according to the intensity of luminescence of cellular alpha-granules and presence of aggregates. The method may be used for the prognosis of thrombotic complications in patients with atherosclerotic dyscirculatory encephalopathy and controlling the efficacy of therapy by antiaggregant agents.
