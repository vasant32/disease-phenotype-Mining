Amongst late radiation damage, lesions of the cerebral arteries are relatively rare. The relationship between the radiation and arterio-sclerosis is discussed in connection with a 63-year old female patient with an atheromatous carotid stenosis; at the age of 5 years she received high dose rate radiation for cervical node tuberculosis. From animal experiments and an increasing number of human observations, it is concluded that radiation may be a predisposing and accelerating local factor in the formation of arterio-sclerosis. Amongst the recognised cases of radiogenic carotid stenosis or occlusion, the latent period averages 30 (9-57) years.
