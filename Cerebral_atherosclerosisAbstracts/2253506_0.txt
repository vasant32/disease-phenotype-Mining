The associated antigen of factor VIII in plasma of 124 cases of cerebrovascular disease and 40 normal cases were detected using immune rocket electrophoresis. There were significant differences between the 3 illness groups and the normal group. The results suggest that the associated antigen of factor VIII may be one of the useful markers for forecasting the danger of cerebrovascular disease.
