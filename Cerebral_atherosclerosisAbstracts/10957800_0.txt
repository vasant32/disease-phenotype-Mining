Taking into consideration the age-specific and adaptive changes of the vascular wall, pathomorphologic features of cerebral atherosclerosis were revealed in 236 individuals who died of ischemic heart disease and in 17 patients undergone extra-intracarotid microshunting on the basis of the data obtained from pathomorphologic analysis of the great arteries of the brain. There was a statistically significant prevalence of both the size of the area of atherosclerotic lesions and the incidence of stenosis of the great arteries of the brain in individuals with combined atherosclerosis of cerebral and coronary atherosclerosis. Type-specific peculiarities of atherosclerosis in the areas of reduced blood flow in stenosis of extra- and intracranial arteries were determined.
