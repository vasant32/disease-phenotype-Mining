Abnormal increases of antiphospholipid antibody and plasma homocysteine levels are recently emerging as nonlipidic risk factors for cerebral atherogenesis and thrombosis. Both antiphospholipid antibody and homocysteine share many similar bioeffects in hemostasis, but their interaction is still inconsistent. In this study, we examined the relation between the plasma homocysteine level and lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibody in patients with noncardiac cerebral ischemia. Systemic lupus erythrematosus patients were excluded. The results showed a higher frequency of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with an abnormal increase of lupus anticoagulant only. Neither the serum folate and cobalamin levels nor methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase allele mutation contributes to this result. Accordingly, homocysteine interacts with lupus anticoagulant to promote cerebral atherosclerosis and ischemia. The role of vasculopathic or prothrombotic autoantibody generation in response to specific pathological change such as hyperhomocysteinemia warrants further investigation.
