A total of 112 patients with ischemic stroke and 115 patients of different sexes and age with dyscirculatory encephalopathy were examined for the main risk factors of cardiovascular diseases. Hypokinesia and obesity were most common in chronic vascular brain pathology whereas frequently occurring and prolonged psychoemotional overstrain, aggravated heredity and alcohol abuse promoted the occurrence of acute disorders of brain circulation. The combination of 4 and more risk factors significantly raises the probability of acute cerebral ischemia.
