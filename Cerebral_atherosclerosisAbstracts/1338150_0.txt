The paper deals with a study into the status of the autonomic nervous system and hormonal homeostasis in 58 patients with ischemic brain stroke. The blood content of cortisol, thyroxine, triiodothyronine and prolactin was measured by radioimmunoassay. The data obtained point to the differences in the degree of vegetative and hormonal imbalance depending on hemispheric lateralization of a pathological focus and the level of brain injury. The intensity of the vegetative and hormonal disorders correlates with the gravity of neurological deficit, with the development of secondary lesions of the cardiovascular system in cerebral dyshemia, being closely related to the disease outcome. The study creates prerequisites for the design of optimal methods of pharmacological correction of vegetative and hormonal dysfunction in patients with cerebrovascular diseases.
