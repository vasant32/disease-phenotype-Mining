Apoproteins from plasma lipoproteins were localized by immunofluorescence techniques in human carotid artery atherosclerotic lesions. These studies were performed in light of the possible importance of these apoproteins in both lipid metabolism and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. ApoA-I from high density lipoproteins, apoB from low density lipoproteins, and apoC-III from very low density lipoproteins were localized also as markers for their respective lipoproteins, since the latter cross-react immunologically. The three apoproteins were localized to the same regions of lesions as neutral lipids and, to some extent, fibrinogen. These regions consisted of bands of collagen fibers, usually deeper within the lesion, and the lipid core or atheroma of such advanced lesions. Although the superposition of localization for the three apoproteins and lipid was only 53%, it was suggested that deviation from complete superposition was due to the abrupt changes in lesion structure resulting from the focal nature of the atherosclerotic process. These results suggest that there is a broader specificity than previously implied of the interaction between such lesion components as connective tissue and extracellular lipid accumulations, and apoproteins from plasma lipoproteins. This interaction is believed to result in a net retention within atherosclerotic lesions of human extracranial arteries of these plasma-derived factors, either as free apoproteins or as native lipoproteins.
