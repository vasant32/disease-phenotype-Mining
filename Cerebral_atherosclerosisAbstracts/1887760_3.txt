A total of 20 subjects with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS) and a group of healthy controls were compared as to their cognitive performance. Subjects with ACAS showed substantial deficits on tasks of mental speed, learning, visuospatial abilities, verbal processing and deductive reasoning. The cognitive profile of ACAS--subjects indicated non-specific impairment, possibly related to widespread cerebral vascular disease, of which the presence of ACAS may be one indicator.
