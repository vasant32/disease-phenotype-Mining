The influence of age and other risk factors (history of hypertension and diabetes, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia) on cerebral atherosclerosis was studied in 462 patients with RIA who had cerebral angiography. The degree of atherosclerosis was quantified using extracranial and intracranial cerebrovascular scores (ECS, ICS) based on the number and severity of the lesion in 11 extracranial and 21 intracranial arterial segments. Thirty-six percent of the patients under age 45 had a normal angiogram compared with 17% of the patients over 45. In the subgroup of patients with abnormal angiogram the mean ECS and ICS vascular scores were not significantly different in the two age groups. Cigarette smoking was the only risk factor to show a strong association with the extracranial score, and it was independent of the effect of age and other risk factors.
