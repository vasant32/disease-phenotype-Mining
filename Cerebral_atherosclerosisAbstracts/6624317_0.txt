Clinical, histological and biochemical studies of the brain in 100 cases of atherosclerosis with relatively similar intensity of changes in the cerebral vascular walls (over 50% of the intima surface being impaired) were carried out. Correlation of the corresponding parameters in groups of diseases differing by their clinical picture permitted the author to ascertain that the selective vulnerability of the cortical neurons in the cerebral hemispheres is dependent on both the intensity of their physiological activity and on the nature of lipid metabolism disorders secondary to dystrophic processes.
