Ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) may share genetic factors contributing to a common etiology. This study investigates whether 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CHD in multiple antecedent studies are associated with incident ischemic stroke in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. From the multiethnic ARIC cohort of 14,215 individuals, 495 validated ischemic strokes were identified. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age and gender, identified three SNPs in Whites and two SNPs in Blacks associated with incident stroke (p <or= 0.05). The rs11628722 polymorphism in SERPINA9 was associated with incident stroke in Whites and Blacks, even after taking into account traditional risk factors. The idea that ischemic stroke and CHD may share some common genetic factors, such as variation in SERPINA9, should be investigated in other studies.
