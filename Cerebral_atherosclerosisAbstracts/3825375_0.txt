The author studies 109 patients with schizophrenia combined with cerebrovascular pathology (vegetovascular crises, essential hypertension, cerebral atherosclerosis). The effect of vascular disorders on the clinical picture and course of different forms of schizophrenia was found to be heterogeneous, being dependent on the severity of vascular disease, as well as the type of the course and progression of the schizophrenic process. Changes in the psychopathological structure of schizophrenic manifestations were the greatest in patients with periodic, shift-like, and slowly progressive schizophrenia.
