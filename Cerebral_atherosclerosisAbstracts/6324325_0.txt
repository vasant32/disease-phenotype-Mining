Red blood cell filtration, platelet aggregation, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were investigated in 15 patients with chronic cerebrovascular disease, 10 of whom treated with Suloctidil and 5 with pentoxifylline. The treatment was carried out in 90 days. Both pentoxifylline and Suloctidil produced a significant improvement of erythrocyte deformability and a decrease of platelet aggregation.
