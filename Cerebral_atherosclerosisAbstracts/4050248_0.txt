Clinical and angiographic examination of 20 patients with stenoses in the system of the internal carotid artery before and after operations for the formation of extra-intracranial microvascular anastomoses (EICMA), and during EICMA functioning demonstrated the evolution of the stenoses. It was characterized both by their increase (even up to the occurrence of thrombosis) and by their regression. No evolution of the stenoses occurred when EICMA failed to function. The character of evolution of the stenosis was determined by its localization. The trend of the evolution was dependent on the etiology of the stenosis. The degree of EICMA functioning differed and was determined by the character of stenosis evolution. With the development of stenosis into thrombosis, the neurological symptom complex was characterized both by marked augmentation followed by regression as well as by the absence of any changes or positive dynamics of the neurological changes.
