 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) serum level and the promoter 5A/6A polymorphism of the MMP-3 gene with atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) in a Chinese Han population. METHODS: Two hundred and fifteen patients with acute ACI from the Department of Neurology of Taizhou Hospital and 226 healthy controls were included in the study. Serum MMP-3 level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for the common 5A/6A functional promoter polymorphism of the MMP-3 gene. RESULTS: The genotype distribution of the MMP-3 promoter 5A/6A polymorphism between the ACI patients group and the control group was significantly different (chi (2)= 9.389, P= 0.002). The frequencies of the 5A allele were 14.2% and 7.7% in the ACI patients group and the control group respectively (chi (2)= 9.430, P= 0.002). Serum level of MMP-3 in the ACI patients group was significantly higher than that in the control group (t= 24.867, P= 0.000). Among the ACI patients group, serum MMP-3 levels also had significant difference between the 5A/6A+ 5A/5A and the 6A/6A genotype (t= 2.057, P= 0.041). CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that serum level of MMP-3 obviously increased within 48 hours of ischemic stroke and the genetic polymorphism of 5A/6A in the MMP-3 promoter is associated with ACI and MMP-3 expression in the Chinese Han population.
