An 85-year-old woman had subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of a very rare left infra-posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm, a saccular aneurysm located proximally at the junction of vertebral artery (VA) and PICA. Right vertebral angiography demonstrated the aneurysm since the left VA was occluded in the extracranial portion. The aneurysm projected in the opposite direction to common VA-PICA aneurysms. The angiographical and intraoperative findings imply this rare aneurysm resulted from the hemodynamic changes caused by the VA occlusion. Detailed exploration of angiography is emphasized to detect such rare aneurysms among the diversity of hemodynamic patterns in elderly patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
