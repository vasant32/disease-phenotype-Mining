In patients with vascular brain pathology the authors observed cases of temporal epilepsy in the clinical picture of which prevailed (and sometimes were isolated) vegetative-vascular "stenocardia" paroxysms. Such clinical states made it possible to suggest that in this contingent there was stenocardia proper. Stenocardiac paroxysms, due to cerebral pathology, were in combination with affective, mnestic and other psychopathological and neurological symptoms, indicating to an involvement into the vascular process of cortical representations of vegetative functions in the temporal area: hippocamp, amygdalar nucleus and their connections with the diencephalo-stem structures.
