The authors carried out angiographic examinations in 327 patients with tumours in the cervical region and 11 of these (3.36%) demonstrated complications, toxico-allergic ones in 10 and thromboembolism of the cerebral vessels--in one case. Toxico-allergic reactions and dynamic disturbances of the cerebral circulation developed more often in contrasting 2 or more brachycephalic vessels, with a two-fold introduction of the contrast medium into one and the same vascular basin and also in cases of a quick injection of a relatively large amount of the compound into the vertebral artery. Thromboembolism of the cerebral vessels was, apparently, caused by a small clot of blood which occluded an atherosclerotically altered internal carotid artery at the site of its bifurcation. Clinical manifestations of the said complications and a number of preventive and curative measures in case of cerebral complications arising during cervical angiography are considered in detail.
