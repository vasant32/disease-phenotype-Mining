In the experimental rabbit arteriosclerosis, the change of the cerebrovascular hemodynamic parameters (CVHP) and the effect of Chuanxiong (CX) on CVHP were observed. In arteriosclerosis group (AS group), the mean flow (Qmean), mean velocity (Vmean), maximal velocity (Vmax) and minimal velocity (Vmin) of the carotid blood flow and cerebrovascular compliance for zero pressure (CO) were significantly decreased (P < 0.05, 0.01), but the values of cerebrovascular peripheral resistance (R) and characteristic impedance (Zc) were significantly increased (P < 0.05 and 0.01), and the value of R showed significant positive correlation with the extent of carotid lesions (P < 0.01). All indexes of CVHP of the Chuanxiong group (CX group) were close to and had no significant difference from those of the normal group (N group) but Qmean, Vmean, Vmin, CO and R were significantly better than those of the AS group (P < 0.05, 0.01). These results showed that CX can effectively improve cerebrovascular hemodynamics.
