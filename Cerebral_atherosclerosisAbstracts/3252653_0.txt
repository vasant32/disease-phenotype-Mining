Altogether 169 operations of patients with occlusion or stenosis of the brain arteries and brain magistral arteries are reviewed. In 151 patients the cause of disease was atherosclerosis. No one of the patients has died. According to the thorough investigation consisting of panangiography, dynamic scintigraphy, sonography, ophthalmodynamometry, CT and other clinical investigations, either extra-intra-cranial shunts (STA MCA), or endarterectomies were carried out. The indications for these operations were elaborated with regards to the cause of tandem changes in arteries or to bilateral atherosclerotic changes of the brain arteries. Out of the total 169 operations, 30 endarterectomies were performed. Only two post-surgical complications have appeared, one of them post STA MCA operation and the other after endarterectomy.
