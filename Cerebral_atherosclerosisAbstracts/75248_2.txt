Computed tomographic examinations of parkinsonian patients revealed a high incidence of cerebral atrophy, in most cases a combination of cortical atrophy and ventricular enlargement. The present study considered the relationship between cerebral atrophy and physical signs indicating or promoting arteriosclerosis such as overweight, electrocardiographic changes, hypertension, calcification of the internal carotid artery and aorta as well as elongation of the aorta. The study is based on 173 treated and untreated parkinsonian patients (89 men, 84 women) aged from 37--84 years (mean 64.6), on whom CT was performed about 5.4 years after the onset of the first symptoms of the illness. The results demonstrate an increase of pathological CT findings as well as of calcification in the carotid siphon with advanced age. No correlation was found between the other items and increasing age. Further analysis of the relationship between cerebral atrophy and signs of arteriosclerosis revealed only a statistically relevant correlation with calcification of the carotid siphon, especially with calcification of the media. Since pathological CT findings and calcification of the internal carotid artery are both related to advanced age, whereas all the other items which may be considered to be indications of arteriosclerosis do not have any clear relationship, it is concluded that the cerebral atrophy in Parkinson's disease is not caused by arteriosclerosis.
