Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an alternative method for imaging the cerebral vasculature. Intravenous DSA is used primarily for evaluating the common carotid bifurcation. The superior image quality of arterial DSA makes it more suitable for studying intracranial arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, and tumor circulation.
