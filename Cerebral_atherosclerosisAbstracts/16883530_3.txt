 OBJECTIVE: To explore the distribution of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase gene (LCAT) 608C/T polymorphism in Chinese Han population and the relationship of the polymorphism association with the occurrence of atherosclerotic cerebral infarction. METHODS: The lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase gene 608C/T polymorphism is identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in 150 patients with ACI and 122 healthy controls matching age and sex. RESULTS: The distribution of LCAT 608C/T gene polymorphism was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The CT genotype frequency (14.0%) and T allele frequency (7.0%) in ACI group were significantly higher than those in control group (P<0.05). The concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in 608CC subgroups were significantly higher than those in 608CT subgroups both in ACI group and in control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The LCAT 608C/T polymorphism is possibly a predisposing factor in ACI happening of Chinese Han population. T allele frequency is possibly concerned with the metabolism of HDL-C.
