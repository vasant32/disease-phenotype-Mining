An open cross-over investigation of intravenous digital subtraction angiography of carotid arteries was carried out to compare image quality, side effects and pulmonary circulation time of iohexol and meglumine-Na-Ca metrizoate. Successive injections of the two contrast media were given under identical conditions. A significantly higher frequency of artifacts from swallowing and motion was noted after metrizoate injections. A lower frequency of subjective and objective side effects was found following iohexol injections.
