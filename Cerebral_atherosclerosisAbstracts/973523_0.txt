The paper is concerned with a study of confabulation seen in 95 patients. A gradual development of the confabulatory syndrome (from mnemonic confabulations to ecmnestic) was seen in senile dementia (5 cases) and in its combination with vascular atherosclerosis (61 cases). An acute development of confabulations (with a prevalence of mnemonic false reminiscence over ecmnestic) was seen in cerebral atherosclerosis (9 cases). Rudimentary ecmnestic confabulations, without mnemonic were seen in Alzheimer's disease (20 cases). The author established a certain correlation between ecmnestic confabulations and disturbances of fixation, between mnemonic confabulations and disorders of selective reproductivity, between their expressiveness and emotional liveliness and the degree of actualization of the past events. In a complacent-euphoric and anxiety affect the confabulations were spontaneous and were accompanied by psuedoactivity. In depressive states they were fragmentary and were detected only in response to questions. Aphatic disorders and the severity of dementia influence the mnestic confabulations making them poorer and incomplete.
