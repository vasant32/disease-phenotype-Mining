The percentage of arteriosclerotic changes with or without dyslipaemic humoral deviation was studied in a sample of subjects with altered purine metabolism of various corresponding clinical expression and the percentage of hyperuricaemia in a homologous sample of arteriosclerotics. It is concluded that a definite dependent relationship between arteriosclerotic lesions and abnormality of purine metabolism remains a hypothesis and that between the two metabolic alterations there is a more or less indirect associative, chronological and dysmetabolic involvement relationship.
