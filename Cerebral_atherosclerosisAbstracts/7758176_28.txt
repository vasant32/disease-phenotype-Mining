BACKGROUND: It has been reported that the D allele of an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with conditions of increased cardiovascular risk, including left ventricular hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Considering that a genetically determined overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system may influence cardiac as well as vascular growth, we investigated possible relations between ACE I/D genotype and carotid artery wall thickness (B-mode ultrasound) in 199 subjects, 50 to 64 years old, sampled from the general population of Vobarno, a small town in northern Italy. ACE DD genotype was associated with significantly higher common carotid artery intima-media thickness (P = .003). The occurrence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques was similar in the different genotypes. There was no association of the ACE I/D genotype with blood pressure values (either casual of 24-hour ambulatory monitored). CONCLUSIONS: ACE DD genotype may be considered a risk factor for the development of common carotid intima-media thickening in our study population.
