As a means of preventing secondary ischaemic stroke, angioplasty and stenting are considered potentially beneficial for patients with severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. However, the role of stenting has been challenged since the publication of the first randomised controlled trial on Stenting versus Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent stroke in Intracranial arterial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS). This indicated that aggressive medical management was superior to stenting using Wingspan to prevent recurrent stroke, because stenting has a high peri-procedural stroke and death rate. In this paper, we review the management of intracranial atherosclerosis, revisit the skepticism on stenting, and state our position on the topic in the form of recommendations. These are based on the prevalence of the disease in Hong Kong, the high risk of recurrent stroke despite medical therapy in the presence of haemodynamic intracranial stenosis without sufficient collaterals, an analysis of the weak points of SAMMPRIS, and results of clinical studies in Hong Kong.
