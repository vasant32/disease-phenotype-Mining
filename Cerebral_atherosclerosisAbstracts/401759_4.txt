A double blind trial was performed in a geriatric unit in order to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of Trental 400 (400 mg Pentoxifylline per tablet) against a comparative formulation (2,4 mg adenosine per tablet) in 36 patients displaying signs of peripheral vascular disease and in 16 patients with symptoms of cerebrovascular disorders. 3 tablets were administered daily over a period of three months. Trental 400 proved to be significantly more effective in either indication group. Based on the observed good tolerability and pronounced efficacy Trental 400 can be considered as an easy to handle therapeutic tool for the long term treatment of symptoms resulting from peripheral and cerebral vascular disorders.
