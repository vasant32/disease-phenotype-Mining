In a series of animal experiments to provoke atherosclerosis, angiographic evaluation of the cerebral vessels was obtained. The angiographic evaluation of cerebral changes and correlation with the pathological alterations known to occur illustrate the value of this technique in long term analysis of induced atherosclerosis in the experimental animal. Control groups, high cholesterol diet groups, and induced hypertensive groups with and without a high cholesterol diet were evaluated by serial angiographic techniques. Examples of angiographic changes are demonstrated and have proven of considerable value in following the progress of the vascular changes.
