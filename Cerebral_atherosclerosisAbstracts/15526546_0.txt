Recent researches focused on the study of the role of the inflammation in the atherothrombotic pathogenesis of the acute cerebral ischemia. The aim of the study was to identify some acute phase proteins with possible role in the pathogenesis of the ischemic stroke. Some acute phase proteins were prospectively investigated by standard methods in sera of 78 patients with ischemic stroke in the first admission day. There were two groups according to neurological deficit one month after the ischemic stroke: good outcome and poor outcome. In the second group mean value of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.122 +/- 0.06 g/l (p < 0.01), mean value of C3 was 2.61 +/- 0.36 g/l (p < 0.01), mean value of C4 was 0.73 +/- 0.07 g/l (p < 0.05), mean value of alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) was 4.9 +/- 0.46 g/l (p < 0.01), mean value of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) was 0.33 +/- 0.04 g/l (p < 0.01), mean value of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AGA) was 1.12 +/- 0.15 g/l, (p < 0.05), mean value of fibrinogen was 2.6 +/- 0.22 g/l (p < 0.01), mean value of haptoglobin was 2.8 +/- 0.33 g/l, (p < 0.05), mean value of transferrin was 2.8 +/- 0.26 g/l (p < 0.05), mean value of ferritin was 238 +/- 22.42 microg/l (p < 0.001), mean value of fibronectin was 2.14 +/- 0.17 g/l (p < 0.05), mean value of ceruloplasmin was 1.23 +/- 0.24 g/l (p < 0.01). High significant values of ferritine and significant values of CRP, C3, AAT, ACT and fibrinogen were observed in patients with poor outcome. The presented data suggest that the studied markers are useful to appreciate the role of the inflammatory reaction in the atherothrombotic pathogenesis of the ischemic stroke.
