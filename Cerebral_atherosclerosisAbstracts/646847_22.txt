The presence of circulating immune complexes was studied in 347 samples of serum from 212 patients with various vascular diseases. Two quantitative methods (complement-consumption assay and C1q-solubility test) were used for the measurement of the concentration of the complexes. Immune complexes were detected in each group of patients tested (coronary arteriosclerosis, myocardial infarction, cerebral artery sclerosis, arteriosclerosis obliterans, phlebothrombosis, pulmonary infarction). A high proportion of positivity was recorded in myocardial infarction (in 43 patients out of the 94 tested) and in arteriosclerosis obliterans (7 out of 11 cases). The possible pathogenic role of the circulating immune complexes is discussed.
