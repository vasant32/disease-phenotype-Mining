 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Disruption of the endothelial layer is the first step in the atherogenic process. Experimental studies have shown that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in endothelial homeostasis and repair. Conversely, EPC depletion has been demonstrated in the setting of established atherosclerotic diseases. With this background, we evaluated whether variations in the number of EPCs are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy subjects. METHODS: Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), levels of circulating EPCs, and cardiovascular risk were compared in 137 healthy subjects. Six subpopulations of progenitor cells were determined by flow cytometry on the basis of the surface expression of CD34, CD133, and KDR antigens: CD34(+), CD133(+), CD34(+)CD133(+), CD34(+)KDR(+), CD133(+)KDR(+), and CD34(+)CD133(+)KDR(+). RESULTS: Among different antigenic profiles of EPCs, only CD34(+)KDR(+) cells were significantly reduced in subjects with increased IMT. Specifically, CD34(+)KDR(+) cells were inversely correlated with IMT, even after adjustment for hsCRP and 10-year Framingham risk and independently of other cardiovascular parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Depletion of CD34(+)KDR(+) EPCs is an independent predictor of early subclinical atherosclerosis in healthy subjects and may provide additional information beyond classic risk factors and inflammatory markers.
