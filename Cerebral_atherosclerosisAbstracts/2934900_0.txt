Calculation of diameter, wall movement, systolic and diastolic flow velocity in the vertebral and carotid artery by means of ultrasonic A-mode-echography and DOPPLER sonography permits identification and quantitative evaluation of cerebrovascular processes in extracranial and intracranial branches and their response to stress, especially in general and regionally accentuated arteriosclerosis, e.g. in predominant vertebrobasilar insufficiency. Their principal reagibility to pharmacotherapy under certain extracerebrovascular preconditions ins demonstrated by significant increase of the reduced hemodynamic parameters accompanied with significant elevation of decreased orthostatic BP after treatment with Raubasine, Dihydroergotamine and Dihydroergocristine.
