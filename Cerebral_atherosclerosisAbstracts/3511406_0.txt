A double-blind random block trial was carried out on 58 patients suffering from chronic cerebrovascular diseases as defined by the "Ad Hoc Committee, Paris 1980". The trial was carried out to assess the effects of citicoline on chronic cerebrovascular disease. Particular attention was paid to the selection of the assessment tools (neuropsychological and psychological tests). Citicoline treatment brought about an improvement in awareness and perceptive-motor faculties. This effect can be attributed to an overall drug action on neural energy metabolism.
