Magnification carotid and vertebral angiography was performed via femoral catheter with  magnification factor of 2.5 to 3.0, utilizing 0.1 X 0.1 ultra fine focal spot, manufactured by Shimadzu Seisakusho, Ltd. The standard angiograms were compared with magnification angiograms in a group of 67 patients with brain tumors and vascular disorders. The magnification angiography was more valuable  than conventional angiography in 12 of 17 vascular tumors, while it was rarely valuable for diagnosis of vascular tumors. Aneurysms, occlusive diseases, collateral vessels, and capillary blush were also visualized to better advantage on magnification angiograms. Magnification cerebral angiography is a useful tool for elucidating small vascular branches, but further refinement in the design of focal spots and angiographic techinques is required for further improvement of magnification cerebral angiography.
