BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of contrast-enhanced fast three-dimensional (3D) MR angiography in depicting both the carotid and vertebral arteries in their cervical portions and to compare MR angiography with conventional angiography for the evaluation of arteriosclerotic disease. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with ischemic cerebral events in the anterior (n = 18) and posterior (n = 9) circulation underwent contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography in the coronal plane. MR angiograms were examined in a blinded fashion by two observers independently. Stenosis was classified according to the appearance of the residual lumen (no stenosis, mild stenosis, moderate stenosis, severe stenosis, occlusion). Conventional angiography was used as the standard of reference. RESULTS: Proximal great vessels and carotid siphons were not assessable on MR angiograms in 35% of cases owing to limited coverage. All cervical and petrous segments of the internal carotid arteries (ICAs) and 93% of the extracranial vertebral arteries were assessable. Flow-related artifacts were observed in seven cases of severe stenosis, including three with signal void at the site of narrowing and four with signal loss in the distal ICA. Interobserver agreement was good and significant. Overall agreement between 3D MR angiography and conventional angiography was good for the anterior and posterior circulations despite a tendency toward overestimation of stenoses on MR angiograms. Clinically relevant stenoses and occlusions were correctly identified on 3D MR angiograms, providing good sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography is a promising tool for assessing arteriosclerotic lesions of supraaortic vessels. Further studies with larger groups are required to determine its value for patient care.
