Patients with stages I and II of vascular encephalopathy developing on the background of atherosclerosis were treated with ascovertin during 21 days. Ascovertin is a complex of flavonoid dihydroquercetin and ascorbic acid. The study group included 21 patients aged 45-65 years and a comparison group consisted of 10 age-matched patients un treated with ascovertin. The ascovertin treatment relieved headache, reduced vertigo and fatigability, improved cognitive functions. The reliable diminishing of whole blood viscosity due to improvement of cellular rheology indices (decrease of aggregation and increase of erythrocyte deformability as well as decrease of indices of lipid peroxidation in erythrocyte membrane and blood plasma) was observed in the stydy group but not in the comparison one.
