It is not known whether subjects with metabolic syndrome and elevated blood pressure are at the same cardiovascular risk as subjects with metabolic syndrome but without elevated blood pressure. Using B-mode ultrasonography, carotid IMT was measured in 1,297 patients (593 men and 704 women) in the medical department of Seiyo Municipal Nomura Hospital between August 1996 and April 2005. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 32.5% among men and 35.9% among women. On comparing subjects with an equal number of components of metabolic syndrome, it was found that the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis was significantly higher in subjects with elevated blood pressure than in those without, and increased with the number of components in the former group (p for trend = 0.0277), but not in the latter (p for trend = 0.5159). In a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for confounding factors, elevated blood pressure (OR, 1.771; 95% CI, 1.246-2.519), low HDL-C (OR, 1.391; 95% CI, 1.053-1.836) and number of components of metabolic syndrome (OR, 1.561; 95% CI, 1.103-2.209) were significantly associated with carotid atherosclerosis. The diagnosis of metabolic syndrome per se might not adequately identify subjects at increased cardiovascular risk.
