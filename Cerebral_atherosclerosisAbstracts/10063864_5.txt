OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to describe the use of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in eight patients with symptomatic high-grade atherosclerotic intracranial internal carotid artery stenoses. We describe our technique for performing the procedure and clinical and radiographic follow-up for an average of 53 months to determine the long-term results. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was shown to be an efficacious treatment for symptomatic intracranial internal carotid artery atherosclerotic disease in our group of patients.
