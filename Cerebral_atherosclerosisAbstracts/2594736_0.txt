Sixty-five cases of mental depression were treated with maprotiline (Ludiomil), including 46 cases of endogenous depression, 18 cases of neurotic depression and 1 case of depression in association with hypertension and cerebral arteriosclerosis. Ludiomil of 50-200 mg/d was given for 4 weeks and clinical pictures evaluated weekly. Clinical results showed complete recovery in 33 cases (50%), improvement in 22 cases (34%), fair in 7 cases (11%) and poor in 3 cases (5%). Dry mouth, constipation and faintness were the commonest side effects. Seizure occurred in 1 case and skin rash in 3 cases. The authors suggest that Ludiomil at a maximal dosage of 150 mg/d can be considered a relatively safe and effective antidepressant.
