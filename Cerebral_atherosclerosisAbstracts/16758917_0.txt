The aim of the study was to define more exactly correlations between circulatory disturbances in the common carotid artery (CCA) basin, and hemodynamic disturbances and structural myocardial remodeling in patients suffering from arterial hypertension (AH) and cerebral atherosclerosis. The subjects were 83 patients evaluated by means of carotid arterial Doppler ultrasonography and echoCG; the variables of central homodynamic were measured as well. The study revealed that patients with AH and moderate CCA stenosis displayed hyperkinetic hemodynamic type more often than patients with severe CCA stenosis, of whom hypodynamic hemodynamic type was more typical. Left ventricular (LV) myocardial remodeling was more frequent in the latter group of patients; asymmetric LV hypertrophy prevailed. The study shows that the process of remodeling, caused by dissociation between central and regional hemodynamics, develops together with the progress of atherosclerotic arterial lesion.
