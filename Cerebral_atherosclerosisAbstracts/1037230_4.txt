Of a series of 100 patients 46 were given combined (i.m. and oral) treatment with ethyl apovincaminate (RGH-4405, Cavinton) in daily doses of 10-30 mg; 54 were put on oral Cavinton (30-45 mg daily). Significant and relatively quick improvement was obtained in reversible vascular diseases, such as hypertensive encephalopathy, intermittent vascular cerebral insufficiency, in the early stage or light cases of cerebral endarteriitis and cerebral arteriosclerosis. On Cavinton effect hypoxic character of the EEG improved, and so did performance in psychodiagnostic tests, alertness and memory in the first place, furthermore changes of the eyeground. The doses administered did not damage parenchymal organs, they did not cumulate and when used in combination incompatibility could not be observed.
