As a result of clinico-physiological examinations 643 patients suffering from cerebral atherosclerosis were divided into 3 groups by the severity of atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels. These patients also exhibited atherosclerosis of the coronary and retinal vessels. Mathematical methods have been used to study the relationship and severity of atherosclerosis of the cerebral, coronary and retinal vessels. The findings obtained indicate that despite a systemic nature of the atherosclerotic process the involvement of various vascular areas is individual and asynchronous. With the development of cerebral atherosclerosis its correlation with atherosclerosis of other localizations becomes closer.
