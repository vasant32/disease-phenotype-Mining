ON the basis of analyzing the clinical picture of the disease in 280 patients suffering from atherosclerosis with transitory disturbances of the circulation in the vertebrobasilar system the author comes to a conclusion that in patients with truncal strokes the clinical picture usually includes symptoms of preceding transitory ischemic episodes. In patients with an ischemic lesion in the basin of the posterior cerebral arteries, the lesion localization and the preceding transitory cerebral circulation disturbances are usually not in agreement: the episodes are characterized by a considerable polymorphism and not infrequently point to a circulatory insufficiency in the arteries of the truncal or the carotid systems. the character, frequency, duration, and number of episodes are of no decisive diagnostic importance as regards the possibility of an ischemic stroke development. One can only speak of a more favourable course of the disease in patients with attacks of systemic dizziness, and of a less favourable course in patients with attacks of unconsciousness and transitory global amnesia.
