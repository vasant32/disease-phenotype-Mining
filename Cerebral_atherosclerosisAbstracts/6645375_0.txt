The study of mental performance of the flying personnel during medical expertise with respect to complex sensory-motor and logical operations has shown that changes of psychic activity in subjects with early symptoms of cerebral atherosclerosis are more marked than those in subjects with CNS functional disorders. They involve difficulties in attention control, delay in motor responses, deterioration in associative processes. These subjects prove less suitable for flying work: 71% of the pilots examined were grounded by the medical expertise.
