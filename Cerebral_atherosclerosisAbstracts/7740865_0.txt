Long-term follow-up of the subjects who have suffered closed brain injury showed that in comparison to matched controls the injured young subjects demonstrated abnormalities in lipid metabolism and coagulation tending to atherosclerosis. The limits of the values by which the patients significantly differed from the controls as well as 7 specific for the patients signs of lipid metabolism and coagulation impairment have been determined. From 1 to 5 specific indications registered in 67 +/- 5% patients allowed the diagnosis in them of the injury sequelae. The mechanisms of the above atherosclerotic shifts may work through neuroregulatory derangements common for brain injury and atherosclerotic encephalopathy and enhancement of atherosclerosis course by the craniocerebral damage.
