A group of patients with atherosclerosis and essential hypertension without clinically manifested signs of cerebral involvement was examined. The methods used included somatosensory evoked potentials, the assessment of the brachial muscles tone by passive sinusoidal movements of the upper arm and the determination of the curves of the isometric activation of the leg muscles during the stimulation of the feet by tactile and painful stimuli. Subclinical impairments of the muscular tone were elucidated. Patients with bilateral changes of the muscle tone show a high risk of the development of encephalopathy; those with unilateral alterations are at risk of developing a cerebral impairment of the corresponding side.
