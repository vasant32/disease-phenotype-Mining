24 patients suffering from arteriosclerotic disorders were divided into 2 groups. One half received 250 ml NaCl with 25 ml Ginkgo-biloba-extract the other 12 were treated with 250 ml NaCl without this substance. The collagen induced platelet aggregation was determined before, immediately after infusion and on the next day. The platelet aggregation increased in both collectives after infusion. In the group treated with Ginkgo-biloba-extract after 1 day values returned into normal range while the aggregation remained increased in the NaCl-group.
