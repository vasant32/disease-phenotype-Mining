Malondialdehyde, vitamin E, glutathione peroxidase and selenium were analysed in the blood of 96 male patients with arteriosclerotic obstructive disease in the region of the leg. Of these 32 patients additionally had manifestations of a coronary or cerebral arteriosclerosis. In the parameters mentioned no significant differences were found between patients with general arteriosclerosis and isolated arteriosclerosis of the leg. Patients with arteriosclerosis and hyperlipoproteinaemia revealed higher values of malondialdehyde than patients without hyperlipoproteinaemia. No correlations were found between malondialdehyde and total cholesterol, triglycerides, vitamin E, glutathione peroxidase as well as selenium.
