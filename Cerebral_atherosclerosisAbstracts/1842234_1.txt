The authors studied the effects of mannitol on intracranial pressure (ICP) in experimental focal ischemia in a rat. Stroke was produced by occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCA). The study revealed that mannitol decreases ICP in ischemic stroke much less then in healthy animals and also a significant rebound effect was seen, especially in the 5th and 7th day after MCA occlusion. The authors suggest a very limited use of mannitol in clinical treatment of elevated ICP after cerebral ischemic stroke.
