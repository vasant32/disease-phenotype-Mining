Using a 1:1 matched case control study, we analysed the data of 105 arteriosclerotic cerebral infarction cases and controls to detect the levels of TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C and Lp(a). The results showed that the average level of Lp(a) in cases was (238.38 mg/L), significantly higher than that of controls (149.98 mg/L t = 3.96, P < 0.001). Comparing the levels of different age groups and sex, no significant difference, except the group over 70 years, which was higher than that in other groups was found. Dose-response analysis also showed that the OR value was positively correlated with the Lp(a). Multi-variable logistic regression model indicated that Lp(a) was an independent risk factor with OR = 1.93. Another risk factor was TG. However, LDL-C, HDL-C were found to be the protective factors of arteriosclerotic cerebral infarction, with an OR = 0.32.
