The authors conducted a study of the histamine system (H), diaminoxidase (DO), histaminopexic index (HPI) using the biological method in 127 patients with hypertensive disease and cerebral atherosclerosis with brain circulation disturbances and in 23 patients with atherosclerotic parkinsonism. It was displayed that in the majority of the patients the H level and HPI value were pathologically changed, but DO activity was disturbed to a lesser degree. The authors demonstrated some correlations between the fluctuations of H-DO-HPI system and the character of the brain circulation disturbances, the period of the stroke, severity of the disease and an etiological factor. According to the authors' opinion changes in H-DO-HPI system were in a direct correlation with fluctuations of the level in the biological fluids of catecholimes, serotonin, acetylcholine, glucocorticoids. Recommendations concerning a discontinuation of histaminemia or its negative effects were given.
