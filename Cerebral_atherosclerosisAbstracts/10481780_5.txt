We report three cases of ischaemic complications following direct surgery of unruptured cerebral aneurysms having necks with atherosclerotic or calcified walls. Among 30 patients we treated directly for unruptured aneurysm over the last 4 years, 6 had 8 such aneurysms. Atherosclerotic or calcified neck was a major contributor to postoperative ischaemic sequelae in our recent series of unruptured aneurysms treated surgically, and common technical problems during surgery seemed to have caused ischaemic complications in the 3 patients reported here. In this report, attention is given to ischaemic complications in the treatment of such aneurysms.
