Atherogenic shift in blood lipid spectrum, which may manifest by the increase of serum levels of cholesterin, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglycerides, very-low-density proteins (VLDL) or the decrease of serum levels of antiatherogenic high-density lipoproteins (HDL), is one of the leading risk factors of atherosclerosis. Patients with atherosclerosis often have normal or subnormal level of cholesterin together with hypertriglyceridemia or no hyperlipidemia (HL) together with decreased serum level of HDL. Among coronary atherosclerosis (CorA), cerebral atherosclerosis (CA) and multifocal atherosclerosis the first condition has been explored more than the others, whose ethiopathogenic features has not been sufficiently studied yet. However, sufficient knowledge of ethiopathogenic features of atherosclerotic process in various blood vessel basins would allow revealing the so called predictors of multifocal lesions and carrying out their timely prophylaxis or inhibiting their progression. Investigation of lipid exchange showed that the most atherogenic alterations are characteristic of CorA and multifocal atherosclerosis. CA is characterized chiefly by HL type IV, while HP type II is more typical of CorA and multifocal atherosclerosis. Triglycerides have been demonstrated to influence mostly the progress of CA while LDL chiefly promote the dissemination of CorA.
