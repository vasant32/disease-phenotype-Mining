Atherosclerotic lesions of the carotid arteries are frequently located eccentrically and are of asymmetric configuration. For their angiographic detection at least two orthogonal views are mandatory. The carotid bifurcations, the proximal internal carotid artery and the carotid siphon can be visualised free from vessel overlap only via often mandatory lateral views that must be obtained by selective arteriography (IA DSA). Smaller lesions and ulcerations of the carotid bifurcation area may be misinterpreted with nonselective IA DSA and IV DSA because of their geometry.
