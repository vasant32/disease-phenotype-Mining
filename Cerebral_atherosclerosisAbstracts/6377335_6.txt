Starting with the disputable practice of evaluating the efficacy of nootropic drugs the author has developed a strictly experimental examination approach emphasising the internal validity of experiments. The physician's assessment of the global therapeutic effect is suggested as a variable examination factor which should be treated as an independent variable and a valid instrument for judging the effect when arriving at a statistical conclusion. Differentiated rating scales and measurements are suggested as a basis for this judgment. Proven effects are described in a more differentiated manner by means of this method which helps in discussing the validity of results.
