 OBJECTIVE: To detect the correlation between the microsatellite DNA polymorphism of adrenomedullin(ADM) gene (repeated sequences of CA) and the atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI). METHODS: With PCR, ADM genotype was monitored from 189 normotensive subjects and 283 cerebral infarction patients. By using radioimmunoassay, their plasma ADM concentration was measured, so as the biochemical index. RESULTS: The genotype distribution of ADM between the health control and ACI groups was significantly different, chi square was 28.732, P < 0.05. As one of the four alleles, including 11, 13, 14 and 19 alleles, the frequency of 19 allele in ACI groups was much higher than that in the health control group, chi square was 26.929, P < 0.05. However, there was no significant difference in plasma ADM concentration among the different genotypes of the ACI patients. CONCLUSION: Microsatellite DNA polymorphism of ADM gene may be associated with the genetic predisposition to ACI.
