A computerized information system has been developed for storing and retrieving the clinical, demographic and laboratory data on 267 patients with transient cerebral ischemia admitted to Duke University Hospital during the past 4 years. The major objective of this computer system is to improve patient care by providing the clinician with immediate information for decision-making and prognostication, based on experience with prior patients with cerebral ischemia similar to those under the clinician's care. The data bank also provides a resource for clinical investigation for transient cerebral ischemia, and represents a repository of detailed information not available in the usual printed sources of medical instruction.
