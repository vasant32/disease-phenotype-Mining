The authors present for the first time the results of investigation and treatment of 55 patients with transitory cerebral circulation disorders (TCCD) and circulatory encephalopathy by the new antioxidant drug emoxipine . The drug was noted to produce a beneficial clinical effect in 39 patients. After emoxipine treatment the patients demonstrated an increase of the endogenous antioxidants, evidence of the formation of the antioxidant depot. In the patients suffering from TCCD, the content of endogenous antioxidants did not differ from normal both before and after the treatment. Improvement of the patients' clinical status correlated with the drug dose and changes in lipid peroxidation. In patients with deterioration of the health status and without any changes, the dose-dependent effect was not recorded.
