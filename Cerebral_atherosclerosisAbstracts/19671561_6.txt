 BACKGROUND: Platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs) have attracted attention as blood coagulation-promoting, endothelial cell-activating factors. The objective of this study was to determine the parameters associated with elevated PDMP levels and examine their relationship with atherosclerotic lesions of main intracranial and extracranial arteries. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Participants included a control group (C) of 61 patients with no apparent cerebral vascular lesions and 110 patients with acute-phase cerebral infarction, consisting of a small-vessel occlusion group (S) of 34 patients, a large-artery atherosclerosis group (L) of 41 patients, a cardioembolism group (CE) of 20 patients, and a stroke of undetermined etiology group (U) of 15 patients. Platelet-derived microparticle levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at the time of admission, and the patients were reclassified into group CP (control level PDMPs), consisting of 70 patients with control PDMP levels, and group HP (high PDMPs), consisting of 40 patients with elevated PDMP levels. All patients underwent cranial magnetic resonance (MR) and carotid ultrasound examinations. RESULTS: Platelet-derived microparticle levels were significantly higher in groups S and L than in group C (P < .01). Concomitant intima-media thickness (IMT; odds ratio [OR] = 1.29, P < .05) and concomitant intracranial stenosis (OR = 3.95, P < .01) were significantly correlated with elevated PDMP levels. Fibrinogen and high-sensitivity CRP levels were significantly higher in group HP than in group CP. CONCLUSION: Alterations in PDMP levels correlated with the presence of atherothrombotic lesions, and PDMP levels are expected to be useful as a clinical indicator, reflecting the presence of intracranial atherosclerotic lesions in the acute phase of cerebral infarction.
