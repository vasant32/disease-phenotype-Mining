The Ca2+ antagonist flunarizine (Flunarl) was administered to 14 patients (4 men and 10 women, 70.9 +/- 2.5 years old, mean +/- S.E.), suffering from cerebral atherosclerosis. The dose was 10 mg/day given for 8 weeks and the following results were obtained. The volume flow of the common carotid artery was increased in the 4th week after the administration, and this increase was maintained until the 8th week. Flunarizine caused improvement of peripheral hemodynamics, induced inhibition of platelet aggregation and improvement erythrocyte deformability. These results indicate that the Ca2+ entry blocker flunarizine improves cerebral and peripheral hemodynamics including microcirculation by inhibiting platelet aggregation and erythrocyte deformability.
