 BACKGROUND: Although atherosclerosis is a silent widespread disease, the focal character of the lesions triggering the clinical manifestations is unquestionable. We hypothesized that symptomatic patients with advanced, unstable carotid plaques have increased local intraplaque and circulating levels of fibrin-fibrinogen related products. METHODS: Plaque tissue and plasma samples were studied in 106 patients undergoing endarterectomy for symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid disease. Fibrin-fibrinogen related products were evaluated by ELISA, Western-blotting, and histology. All tested parameters were compared with patient carotid symptomatology, multiple vascular risk factors (VRF), bilateral carotid pathology, ultrasound examination, and previous therapies with statins and/or antiplatelet drugs. RESULTS: In symptomatic patients, plasma D-dimer was elevated in patients with unstable carotid plaques (UNS) compared with stable (STA) ones (857+/-121 vs. 692+/-156 ng/ml, p=0. 026). Furthermore, plasma D-dimer was significantly increased in patients with a coexistence of carotid and coronary artery disease, compared to others (976+/-325 vs. 714+/-197 ng/ml; p<0.001). Intra-plaque D-dimer content was increased in ulcerated-complicated (UC) plaques compared with fibrous non-complicated (F) plaques in symptomatic patients (5.9+/-1 vs. 1.8+/-1, p<0.001), and in patients with hypercholesterolaemia, compared with those with normal cholesterol levels (6.1+/-1 vs. 2.9+/-0.7; p=0.027). However, there was no correlation between D-dimer content in the carotid plaque and plasma D-dimer levels. CONCLUSIONS: Hypercholesterolemia and UC plaques appear to be associated with high fibrin intraplaque turnover as demonstrated by higher intraplaque D-dimer. Plasma markers of fibrin turnover were increased in UNS plaques, and in patients with coexisting carotid and coronary artery disease. Although, both plasma and plaque D-dimers were associated with unstable carotid disease, the usefulness of the measurement of plasma D-dimer in these patients should be confirmed by prospective studies.
