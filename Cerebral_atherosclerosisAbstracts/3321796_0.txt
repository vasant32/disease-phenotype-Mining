Using computerized methods the authors have analyzed formalized case histories of three variants of an acute disorder of the cerebral circulation in the matter of the cerebral hemispheres verified by pathoanatomical studies: (1) cerebral infarction with a hemorrhagic component (n = 88), (2) a gray ischemic cerebral stroke (n = 80), (3) parenchymatous hemorrhage (n = 71). The informative symptoms and symptom complexes identified can be employed for the differentiation between cerebral infarction with a hemorrhagic component and other types of strokes.
