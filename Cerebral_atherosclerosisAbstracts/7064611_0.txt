Clinical and pathogenetic peculiarities of cerebral strokes in patients suffering from rheumatism were studied. Comparative data (little described in literature) on certain peculiarities of the manifestations of acute cerebral circulation disorders in patients of different age, as well as in patients with rheumatism-accompanying cerebral atherosclerosis and arterial hypertension are presented. A considerable incidence of hemorrhagic strokes and their clinical heterogeneity are noted. Problems of the pathogenesis of the cerebrovascular disorders are discussed.
