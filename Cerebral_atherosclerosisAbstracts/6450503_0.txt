The age dynamics of the atherosclerotic process in the major arteries of the neck and the Willisian circle was examined morphometrically in 330 subjects with diverse morphofunctional states of the thyroid. It was found that in patients with endemic goiter characterized by hyperthyroidism, the speed of the atherosclerotic process development was slowed down; the process took a milder course with prevalence of lipoidosis. In patients with the endemic goiter characterized by hypothyroidism, the atherosclerotic process in all the arteries examined was found to develop at a faster rate, with prevalence of grave complicated forms. Complicated affections and calcinosis of the Willisian circle vessels were prevalent in patients with the hypofunctional forms of endemic goiter.
