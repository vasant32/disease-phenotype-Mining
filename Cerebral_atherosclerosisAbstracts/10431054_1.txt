OBJECTIVE: To detect the relationship between ApoE gene polymorphism and coronary heart disease(CHD), arteriosclerotic cerebral infarction(ACI). METHODS: Exon 4 of ApoE gene was analyzed in normal group(87 cases), CHD group(78 cases) and ACI group(55 cases) by a combination of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and direct AgNO(3) staining technique. RESULTS: Between the control group and CHD group, ACI group, chi(2) test showed no significant difference in genotype of E3/E3 (P>0.5, P>0.1, respectively); while mu test showed no significant difference in allele epsilon(2)(P>0.25, P>0.1, respectively), epsilon(4)(P>0.1, P>0.25, respectively) of ApoE. CONCLUSION: No relationship between ApoE gene polymorphism and CHD and ACI was noted in this study.
