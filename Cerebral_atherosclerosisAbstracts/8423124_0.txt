Peduncular hallucinosis is characterized by vivid hallucinations associated with organic midbrain disease. In the case reported here, the computed tomography brain scan showed basilar arterial atherosclerotic disease with central and cortical atrophy. Carotid imaging revealed bilateral stenosis. The electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging of the midbrain revealed no abnormalities. The patient's symptoms resolved completely in 48 hours. This is believed to be the first report of peduncular hallucinosis as the manifestation of a transient ischemic attack syndrome.
