 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the polymorphism of apolipoprotein A5 gene (APOA5) -12238 T>C and atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI). METHODS: Three hundred and forty-one subjects (170 ACI patients and 171 healthy controls) were collected to determine the genotypes by using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. RESULTS: APOA5 allele frequencies of T/C were 0.588/0.412 and 0.424/0.576 in ACI group and control group respectively. There was significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies between ACI group and control group (P < 0.05). The levels of plasma triglyceride in ACI patients with TT genotype were higher than those in patients with CC genotypes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The relationship is found between the site of APOA5 gene -12238 T>C and ACI. There is a significant correlation between TT genotype of APOA5 and the levels of plasma triglyceride in patients with ACI.
