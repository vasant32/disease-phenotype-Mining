 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence from experimental and genetic studies suggest the existence of a potential link between the polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigen class II gene (HLA-DR) and ischemic stroke. This study addressed the association of HLA-DR gene with atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) in a North Chinese Han population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The genotyping of HLA-DRB1 was determined by standard techniques based on polymerase chain reaction and sequence-specific oligonucleotides hybridization in a gene chip. RESULTS: The relative risk (RR) of HLA-DRB1 FNx01 04 and HLA-DRB1 FNx01 03 (17) in patients with ACI and their first-degree relatives were significantly higher than those in the control group (RR=2.56 and 18.77, respectively; P <0.05). In contrast, the RR of HLA-DRB1 FNx01 12 was dramatically reduced in patients with ACI in relation to healthy controls (RR=0.17; P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1 may influence the risk of ACI in the North Han population of China. Further studies are necessary to validate the observation in larger samples.
