A patient with chronic vertebrobasilar insufficiency due to atherosclerotic affection of the vessels showed repeated exacerbations of that insufficiency which arose either at walk or immediately after a meal. The development of the symptoms on the part of the brain stem was found to be due to blood redistribution in the body: the blood was attracted to the functioning organs, i.e. the lower extremities or the stomach, and "drawn off" the vascular systems of the brain. The development of such a "steal" syndrome of the abdominal type is of a particular interest.
