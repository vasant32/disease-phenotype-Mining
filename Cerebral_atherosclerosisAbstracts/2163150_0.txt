The method of evoked brain potentials was used to study the neurophysiological mechanisms of the brain in 120 patients with atherosclerotic and senile dementia. For the first time the authors obtained the electrophysiological data on the information processing in dementia patients at different levels of attention and revealed differences in the information supply and processing in the course of normal ageing, atherosclerotic and senile dementia. In dementia patients receiving metabolic therapy, the levels of a potential recovery of the work of the projection brain systems were established. Analysis and comparison of the data obtained contribute to a deeper understanding of the neurophysiological processes going in elderly persons and of the pathogenesis of dementia conditions.
