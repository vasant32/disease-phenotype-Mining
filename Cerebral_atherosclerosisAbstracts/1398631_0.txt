On the basis of clinical diagnostic criterion of cerebral arteriosclerosis, we selected, 72 patients with cerebral arteriosclerosis, 72 patients with suspected cerebral arteriosclerosis and 70 healthy individuals and screened 42 variables obtained from clinical and accessory examination with a stepwise discriminant analysis and a stepwise regression analysis. Finally we performed a logistic discriminant analysis of 15 selected variables in order to establish diagnostic discriminant formulas, Ya and Yc. It was found that a diagnostic coincidence rate for rediscriminant analysis of 212 individuals with the formulas was 100%. Very high sensitivity (96.7%), specificity (100%), positive predicted value (100%), negative predicted value (83.3%) and accuracy (97.1%) were noted in a prospective double-blind test on 34 subjects. The authors suggest that the discriminant formulas Ya and Yc established for diagnosis of cerebral arteriosclerosis be widely applicated.
