An X-ray imaging system, using digital subtraction techniques, has been developed. The authors relate the results of a comparative study in 20 patients, affected by cervical occlusive vascular disease, whose arterial cervical system has been investigated both by conventional angiography and intravenous digital subtraction angiography. Indications, advantages and limitations of this new computerized apparatus are discussed.
