Selective laser ablation of human atherosclerotic plaque is possible because endogenous carotenoid pigments found in atherosclerotic plaque confer a twofold preferential absorption of laser radiation at 450 to 500 nm. In this study, patients with carotid endarterectomy were pretreated with oral beta carotene to determine if the carotenoid content and therefore laser selectivity of plaque could be increased in vivo. Beta carotene-treated patients had a significant, nearly twofold increase in their plaque carotenoid concentration, which increased from 0.22 to 0.40 microgram beta carotene/mg cholesterol. These results suggest that selective ablation of atherosclerotic plaque may be enhanced by pretreating patients with doses of oral beta carotene for short periods of time.
