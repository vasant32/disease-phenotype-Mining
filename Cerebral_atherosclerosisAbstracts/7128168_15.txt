A neuropathological study was made in 2 women with Turner's syndrome. Neuropsychological investigation in one of them correlated with what has previously been found in Turner's syndrome as well as with the localization of the most pronounced neuropathological aberration which was of atherosclerotic nature, most pronounced in the right temporo-parietal area. These findings as well as the findings of acidophile hypoplasia of the pituitary gland are discussed.
