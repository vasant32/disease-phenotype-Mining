Noncontact biomicroscopy has been carried out in 107 women, aged 20-57, with the initial symptoms of inadequate blood supply to the brain in the presence of vegetovascular dystonia, arterial hypertension, and cerebral atherosclerosis in order to examine the end blood flow in such abnormalities. The findings evidence a universal pattern of changes in the microvessels in any of the vascular diseases; the severity of these shifts depends on the disease severity and length. Persistent red cell aggregation in the venules of patients with cerebral atherosclerosis is a critical sign predicting the process progressing. Hypercholesterolemia correlates with the severity of intravascular and vascular shifts.
