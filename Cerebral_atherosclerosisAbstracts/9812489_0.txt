An 1:1 matched case-control study including 105 arteriosclerotic cerebral infarction cases and 105 controls was carried out to estimate the etiologic interaction, in Yi-xing city, March 1997. Results showed that the major risk factors were high levels of serum TG, Lp(a) and BMI while serum level of HDL-C was the only protective factor. When several levels were divided on Lp(a) and BMI, a significantly dose response relation was found. Considering the correlation among serum concentration of lipids, we analysed the interaction of different factors, using Log-Linear models. Results showed that there were significant interactions between arteriosclerotic cerebral infarction and TC, TG, HDL-C and Lp(a). There were also interactions between TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C. However, the strongest interaction is expected to happen at what level remains further investigations.
