Clinical and morphological correlations were studied in 69 cases of old closed head trauma. It was found that the degree of the existing morphological changes correlated with the trauma severity, which was reflected in the clinical picture of the disease. Convulsive syndromes developing immediately and in the first years after the trauma correlated with its severity and localization. In the long terms the principal contributors to the condition were chronic alcoholism and other factors. The patients with brain injury (particularly with the convulsive syndrome) earlier developed vascular pathology and their life span was shorter, vs. the general population.
