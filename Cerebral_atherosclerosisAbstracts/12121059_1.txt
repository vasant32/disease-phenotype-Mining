Acetylsalicylic acid inhibits thromboxane A2 production and reduces the risk of vascular occlusive events by 20% to 25%. Ticlopidine inhibits ADP-dependent platelet aggregation and reduces the same risk by 30% to 35%, but produces some adverse effects. Clopidogrel is a ticlopidin-related antiplatelet drug, with the same mechanism of action; it reduces the expression of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, the fibrinogen receptor on the platelet surface. Clopidogrel has the same clinical efficacy of ticlopidin and has a decreased incidence of adverse effects. The effect of one daily dose of 75 mg of clopidogrel on platelet function in 90 subjects was evaluated; 41 with coronary artery disease and 49 with cerebral vascular disease. Before treatment and after 6 and 12 weeks, bleeding time and fibrinogen plasma concentration were also evaluated. There was a reduction in 5-microM ADP-induced platelet aggregation of 38%+/-27% at 6 weeks and 44%+/-29% at 12 weeks in patients with coronary artery disease; 35%+/-41%, 29%+/-59% in the cerebral vascular disease group; and 36%+/-36% and 35%+/-49% in the total group. Reduction of 20 microg/mL collagen-induced platelet aggregation was not significant in any group. Plasma fibrinogen levels did not vary during treatment. Bleeding time was significantly prolonged in all studied groups. There were no hemorrhagic complications; only digestive discomfort in less than 3% of patients. Clopidogrel efficiently reduces ADP-induced platelet aggregation and prolongs bleeding time and is a safe and efficacious antiplatelet drug.
