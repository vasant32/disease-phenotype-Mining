Using scanning and transmission microscopy, the structural transformations of the internal coating of the pial arteries have been investigated in patients with atherosclerosis (grade I+). The examination has revealed marked changes in the intima expressed in variable degree disorganization of the microrelief of the luminal surface of the vessels (diminution in the height and disappearance of the folds, their inadequate orientation, formation of spherical protrusions and crater-like cavities) and in transformations of the structural organization of the endothelium and subendothelial layer (intensification of pinocytosis, impairment of the integrity of intercellular contacts, lipidosis of endothelial cells, subendothelial edema).
