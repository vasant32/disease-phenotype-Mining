BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Embolic complications during ultrasound examinations are a rare cause of neurological deficits. The present case documents the occurrence of embolism by a nonobstructive compression maneuver during transcranial Doppler examination, resulting in a minor stroke. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man suffered from recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Duplex sonography showed a small echogenic plaque at the right carotid bifurcation. During transcranial Doppler studies with a reverberating compression maneuver of the right common carotid artery low in the neck, multiple emboli signals were detected, and the patient developed a left-sided hemiparesis with slurred speech. Funduscopy revealed cholesterol emboli in the inferior temporal arteriole of the right eye. These findings suggested embolization as the cause of the stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Compression maneuvers should not be performed in patients with recent neurological symptoms, even in the case of only small lesions in the extracranial carotid territory.
