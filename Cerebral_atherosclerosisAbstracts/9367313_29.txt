PURPOSE: To review our experience with intracranial angioplasty, including the complications we encountered. METHODS: During a 3-year period, from 1993 to 1996, 10 patients had intracranial percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). The stenosed vessels included three internal carotid arteries, one middle cerebral artery, one basilar artery, and five vertebral arteries. Stenosis in all patients was 75%, or greater. PTA was technically successful in eight patients; in two patients it could not be performed owing to inability to traverse the stenosed area. RESULTS: Two patients had successful and uneventful PTA. Five patients had vasospasm, which resolved with local vasodilators in two and with repeat PTA in one. Vasospasm led to stroke in two patients. Compromise of perforating vessels and arterial dissection were associated with stroke in two patients. CONCLUSION: Intracranial PTA is technically feasible but associated with risks related to vasospasm, arterial trauma, and compromise of perforating vessels.
