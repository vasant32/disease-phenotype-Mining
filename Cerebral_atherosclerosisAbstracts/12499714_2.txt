A circadian distribution with a single peak of stroke onset in the morning hours has been described in various countries. Analysis of the temporal pattern of symptom onset in a series of 1253 Greek first-ever stroke patients revealed a circadian distribution with two incidence peaks between 08.00 and 10.00 h, and between 16.00 and 18.00 h. Considering the different etiopathogenic types of stroke, the same two-peak time pattern was evaluated in all stroke subgroups with the only exception of lacunar stroke, which seems to predominantly occur during night and sleep. A secondary stroke onset peak in the late afternoon has not been previously described in such detail. A relation between the second, however lower, frequency peak and the traditional Greek habit of afternoon sleep (siesta) could be assumed and deserves further investigation.
