For disclosing the character of the immunological reactivity disturbances in atherosclerotic discirculatory encephalopathy the humoral and tissue immunity was examined in 160 patients. Signs of an increase of the hypersensitivity (both immediate and delayed) to local antigens were revealed, these signs correlating with the stage of the encephalopathy development. The changes discovered may be of a diagnostic and prognostic value in chronic forms of vascular encephalopathies.
