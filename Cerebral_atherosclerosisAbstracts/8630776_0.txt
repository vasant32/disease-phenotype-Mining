The paper is concerned with a study into compensatory capabilities of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with atherosclerotic dyscirculatory encephalopathy in constricting lesions of major arteries of the head. A detailed analysis is provided of hemodynamic mechanisms of the natural collateral's work, viz., via anterior communicating artery and conditions for creation of suprablock anastomosis with the internal carotid artery being occluded. The paper also addresses the advantages and disadvantages of compensatory collaterals in the course of the medical condition in question.
