In 119 patients with disseminated sclerosis and 43 normals of the same age, the authors conducted a comparative rheographic study of the state of circulation in the basins of the internal and external carotid arteries and in the vertebro-basillar system. The data permitted to conclude that there was a correlation between the expressiveness of decreased pulse blood repletion of cerebral vessels (especially in the vertebro-basillar system) and the character of a changed vascular tone depending upon the localization of the pathological process. The results of the studies indicate to a necessity of a pathogenetical treatment with reparation directed towards a normalization of cerebral hemodynamics.
