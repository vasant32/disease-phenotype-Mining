 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between interferon-γ(IFN-γ), interleukin-6(IL-6), tumor  necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and cerebral arterial stenosis and to compare serum levels of these inflammatory  cytokines in different cerebral arteries stenosis groups. METHODS: According to the stenotic site, patients with  cerebral arteries stenosis were divided into intracranial stenosis group (n=26), extracranial stenosis group  (n=30), intracranial and extracranial stenosis group (n=27), and group of stenosis in middle cerebral artery  (n=25). And there were 33 samples in the control group. Blood serum IFN-γ, IL-6 and TNF-α levels were  analyzed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). RESULTS: Serum IFN-γ and IL-6 levels were  significantly increased in all the stenosis groups (P=0.000) as compared with the control group. But serum IFN-γ level had no significant difference between the two optional stenosis groups. And IL-6 level in intracranial  stenosis group was lower than those in the other stenosis groups (P<0.05). In addition, we found that TNF-α of  intracranial stenosis group (P=0.001) and MCA stenosis group (P=0.015) significantly increased as compared with  the control group and the other two stenosis groups. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that IFN-γ, IL-6 and TNF-α are possible to participate in the formation of certain cerebral arterial stenosis.
