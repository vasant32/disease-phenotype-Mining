The aim of this study is to describe the clinical characteristics and the pathological mechanisms of carotid transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in 117 patients which were hospitalised for such symptoms. Our results show a male predominance, except for age group under 40 and over 79 years. The principal cardiovascular index and risk factors are: arterial hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, vascular intermittent claudication and hematocrit greater than 46%. Amongst our patients, 17% with hemispherical and mixed TIAs had a cerebral infarction proved by CT-Scan, the recent aspect and localisation of which were compatible with symptoms. The atherosclerotic causes are more frequently associated with mixed and retinal TIAs than hemispheric TIAs. This fact may be attributed to a larger proportion of stenotic atherosclerotic lesions by mixed TIAs than hemispheric ones. The cardiac embolic pathogenic mechanism is responsible for 11% of TIAs if considered individually; of 5% if associated with carotid atherosclerosis.
