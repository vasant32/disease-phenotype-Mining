Using Doppler ultrasonography (DUSG) under outpatient conditions multiple combined lesions of the main arteries of the head were found in 127 patients. Comparison of the above results with the findings of cerebral angiography showed a high efficiency of DUSG. In occlusion of the carotid and vertebral arteries the accuracy of the method was 99%, specificity 99%, sensitivity 100%; in stenoses of the internal carotid arteries the respective values were 88, 84, and 95%; in cases of all stenoses of the vertebral arteries they were 93, 92, and 94%. A comparative analysis of the clinical, Doppler and angiographic findings revealed that an increase in the frequency and degree of impairment of the main arteries of the head correlated with an elevated rate of cerebral circulation disorders in several vascular beds.
