The article presents clinico-hemodynamic characteristics of 81 patients with initial disordered-circulatory atherosclerotic encephalopathy (33 aged 45-59 years and 48 aged 60-74 years) and of 65 patients with hypertensive encephalopathy (32 aged 45-59 years and 33 aged 60-74 years). Fifty-six normal subjects served as controls. The findings confirm the role of abnormalities at various functional levels of the circulatory system in the pathogenesis of cerebral vascular insufficiency at early stages of the disease.
