We have studied prevalence of risk factors (RF) of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) recorded for statistical purposes in subjects of able bodied age during  10 year period of observation in a policlinic as well as prevalence of early and/or oligosymptomatic CVD manifestations in 11762 subjects of working age with RF of CVD development according to results of complex noninvasive examination of cardiovascular system in ambulatory conditions during the period from 2000 to 2009 year. Numbers of men and women were 45.3 and 54.7%, respectively.  The program of examination included analysis of ECG, echocardiography (EchoCG), ultrasound examination of brachiocephalic vessels, 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring, exercise test on treadmill. In 2006 and 2007 complex examination was supplemented with 24-hour monitoring of arterial pressure, stress EchoCG, noninvasive arteriography. Complex ambulatory examination of subjects of working age with FR of CVD development with the use of noninvasive methods of functional diagnostics allowed to diagnose in 56% of studied persons various early and/or oligosymptomatic CVD manifestations which often appeared in combination, including ischemic heart disease (in 15%), hypertensive disease- (in 42%), cerebral atherosclerosis - (in 23.5%).
