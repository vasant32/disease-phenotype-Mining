During the period of 3 years and 9 months (from September 1980 to May 1984), 44 patients with arteriosclerosis of the carotid arteries were seen at our hospital. In 10 of them, arterial reconstructive surgery was performed. There were 7 men and 3 women. Ages ranged from 50 to 75 years (mean, 61.9 years). They had a total of 13 lesions in the carotid arteries, which were composed of one complete obstruction, 10 stenoses, one aneurysm, and one tortuosity. These lesions were treated by either thromboendarterectomy (TEA), TEA along with vein patch, vein patch, or aneurysmorrhaphy. Three of these 10 patients were subjected to the second operation because of remaining disease or recurrence of symptoms.
