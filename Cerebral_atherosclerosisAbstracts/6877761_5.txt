The optic nerve and chiasm, obtained at autopsy, from 53 cases with clinical histories of cerebrovascular disturbances were histopathologically investigated, and ischemic changes in the posterior portion of the optic nerve were revealed in 12 cases. The progress of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy might be divided into necrotic, liquefactive and scar stages. The lesions were located in the transverse, peripheral, altitudinal and axial areas of the optic nerve. Occlusive changes of the vascular lumina due to atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, capillosclerosis and emboli were demonstrated in association with the ischemic changes in the optic nerve parenchyma.
