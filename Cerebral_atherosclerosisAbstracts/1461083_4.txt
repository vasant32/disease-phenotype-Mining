Twenty-five elderly subjects were examined with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The subjects were divided into two groups: those with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores above 25, and those subjects with MMSE scores between 18 and 24. The degree of white matter abnormalities (WMA) (expressed as relative volumes) as well as the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors were evaluated in the two groups. We found that a) subjects with low MMSE scores had significantly larger relative volumes of WMA than the subjects with higher scores, b) a significant correlation (rs = 0.53, p < 0.009) between MMSE scores and the relative volume of WMA was also established, and c) a weak significant correlation (rs = -0.51, p < 0.05) between arterial blood pressure and WMA was found in the subjects with high MMSE scores. Besides these findings no other correlations between the presence of cerebrovascular risk factors and WMA were found in any of the groups.
