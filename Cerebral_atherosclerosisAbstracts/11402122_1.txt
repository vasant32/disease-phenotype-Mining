Abciximab was administered intravenously to three patients to treat thrombus associated with atherosclerotic stenosis of a supra-aortic artery. In two cases, the thrombi had been identified on a previous angiography more than a week before treatment. Successful thrombolysis was achieved with abciximab in all three cases. In this small series, abciximab had a thrombolytic effect on established thrombi that were refractory to previous antithrombotic treatment attempts.
