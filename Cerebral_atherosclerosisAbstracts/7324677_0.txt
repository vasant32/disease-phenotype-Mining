On the basis of analyzing the clinical picture of the disease in 81 patients with cerebral atherosclerosis the authors come to a conclusion that the transitory cerebral circulation disturbances exhibited by these patients after an ischemic stroke were usually due to a combined affection of the carotid and the vertebrobasilar arteries. In all these patients the ischemic focus was localized in the brain hemispheres within the basin of the median or posterior cerebral arteries and manifested in moderate focal symptoms. The disturbances usually arose some months or years after the stroke, and pointed, as a rule, to an insufficiency of the circulation in the brain trunk. The appearance of the transitory cerebral circulation disturbances after an ischemic stroke may be, probably, a consequence and manifested in moderate focal symptoms.

The disturbances usually arose some months or years after the stroke, and pointed, as a rule, to an insufficiency of the circulation in the brain trunk. The appearance of the transitory cerebral circulation disturbances after an ischemic stroke may be, probably, a consequence of a circulatory decompensation resulting from progressing atherosclerotic changes of the cerebral vessels, or may be due to a cerebrovascular insufficiency because of arterial pressure fluctuations or a cardiac disease.
