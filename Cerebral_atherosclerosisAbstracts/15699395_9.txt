Paramedian pontine infarct (PPI) is usually attributed to basilar artery (BA) atherosclerosis. However, this hypothesis has thus far been supported only by post-mortem studies. The authors show that high-resolution MRI is a promising method that can detect BA plaques in patients with PPI at or near the origin of the penetrating artery, whereas MR angiograms may appear normal.
