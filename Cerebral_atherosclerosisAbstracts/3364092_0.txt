Dynamic examination of 47 patients over the first three weeks after the development of ischemic stroke (IS) has revealed a significant decrease in the natural killer activity (NKA) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). A decrease in the NK activity in IS patients appears to be related to dyslipoproteinemia, which has been confirmed by the detection of a reverse correlation between the values of the NKA and the atherogenicity coefficient, while suppression of ADCC in the same patients is explained by the suppressive influence of the prostaglandin system, which has been investigated in vitro. The elucidation in IS patients of immunopathological phenomena related to impairments of the effector component of immunity and of activities of NK- and K-cells justifies the inclusion of immunocorrecting drugs into the comprehensive therapy of IS.
