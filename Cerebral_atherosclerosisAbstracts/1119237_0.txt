In 160 patients with disorders of brain circulation in cerebral atherosclerosis, 68 normals and 38 patients with different neurological diseases (a control group), a special study was undertaken to study the antibrain antibodies with the aid of a complement fixation test (CFT), and a test of complement utilization (CUT). Positive results in the CFT and CUT were seen in patients with ischemic strokes and transient disorders of brain circulation. The formation of antibodies to brain tissues depends upon their type, duration of the disease and is more characteristic of the rehabilitation period. In studying autoimmune processes in patients with disordered brain circulation previous diseases should be taken into consideration (brain trauma, epilepsy, strokes). The existence of antibrain antibodies correlates with the intensity of the process.
