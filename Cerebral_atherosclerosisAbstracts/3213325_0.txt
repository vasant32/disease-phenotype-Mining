Autonomic functions were studied in 111 patients with initial stages of the brain blood vessel atherosclerosis. Sympathetic responses prevailed alongside with psychic activation (high level of emotional and personality involvement), electrophysiological activation (baseline alpha-index reduction, its increased responsiveness to functional loads). Psychophysiological activation could be involved in the atherogenesis mechanisms through enhanced hemodynamic shifts, lipid peroxidation and lipid metabolic changes.
