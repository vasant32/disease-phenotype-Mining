Beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-gpI) is a phospholipid cofactor with anticoagulant properties. A number of biological functions in the coagulation cascade have been attributed to this cofactor. Sera from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) frequently react to beta2-gpI in immunoassays. Occasionally, patients with thrombotic diathesis present anti-beta2-gpI antibodies in the absence of other antiphospholipid antibodies (APA). More recently, the presence of beta2-gpI in the atherosclerotic plaque has been proved. In this article, we initially approach the physiological functions of beta2-gpI in the coagulation cascade, and we also review the importance of anti-beta2gpI antibodies in patients with APS, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and infections. Lastly, we focus the role of anti-beta2-gpI antibodies in coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis.
