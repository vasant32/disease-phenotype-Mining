Epidemiological studies suggest that dyslipoproteinemias and hyperlipoproteinemias present one of the most important risk factors in the development of atherosclerosis and its complications. The aim of this study was to find out which of the lipid status disorders in patients with ischemic brain disease was the most important risk factor in the development of cerebral atherosclerosis. Patients with ischemic brain disease were examined in the acute and subacute phase. Total blood cholesterol, low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) as well as of apolipoproteins A1 and B were determined. Correlations (atherogenic indices) of some lipid components with the severity of clinical course and echo-angiographic finding were determined. It was concluded that the highest correlation with the cerebral atherosclerosis severity degree existed with the level of apoA1 and apoB apolipoproteins, followed by correlation of LDL and HDL cholesterol, and the lowest correlation was found between HDL and the total cholesterol. Accordingly, apolipoproteins, i.e., apoA1/apoB indices are the most sensitive markers of the risk for atherogenesis.
