Five haemorheological variables (haematocrit, plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, red cell deformability and yield shear stress) and the plasma fibrinogen concentration were determined in blood samples from 21 untreated patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE, Binswanger's disease). The results were compared with those obtained in blood samples from 40 untreated patients with lacunar infarcts and from 275 healthy control subjects without vascular risk factors. Pathological ("solid body") flow behaviour was detected in the blood of both groups of patients (SAE and lacunar infarcts). However, highly elevated plasma viscosity was a consistent feature only of SAE. The authors present the hypothesis that the high plasma viscosity in patients with SAE may account for the progressive degeneration of cerebral white matter. It is postulated that microcirculatory abnormalities due to microrheological changes may be one of the many missing links in the pathophysiology of SAE.
