On the basis of a study of 218 control subjects in 10-year age groups the authors determined the mean levels and critical values of certain serum lipid components (cholesterol, triglycerides, beta-lipoproteins, esterified fatty acids and total lipids). Forty-two subjects were isolated (11.2%) with hyperlipoproteinaemia. Other atherosclerosis risk factors were determined in them as well. Hypertension was found in 19%, diabetes in 7%, obesity in 14%, smoking in 43%. The authors discuss the criteria qualifying the patients to the control group in the studies on lipid metabolism.
