In a 59 years old patient suffering from a non stenotic atheroma of the internal right carotid artery, 12 attacks of "amaurosis fugax" (a.m.) affecting the right eye occurred over a period of 36 days. Ticlopidine at doses of 500 mg and subsequently of 250 mg per day was administered and the attacks of "amaurosis fugax" briskly stopped. In the 8 month period following the occurrence of the last episode of monocular blindness, the patient continued the therapy with ticlopidine and no visual disturbances were more reported. The most likely pathogenetic hypotheses of "amaurosis fugax" in the present case are discussed as well as the possibility that the relation between the attacks of a.m. and the beginning of the treatment with ticlopidine might be fortuitous.
