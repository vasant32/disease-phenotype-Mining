Psychological testing, cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement, and computed tomographic scan were performed before and 3 months after operation in 31 patients subjected to endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery (ICA) because of transient ischemic attacks and in 11 control patients operated on for atherosclerosis of the lower extremities. In preoperative psychological testing both carotid surgery patients and controls performed somewhat below the normal level for their age group. Postoperatively, cognitive functions improved in the carotid surgery group but not in the control group. The improvement was related to the laterality of the operation, being more marked in verbal tests in patients with left ICA operation and in visuospatial tests in patients with right ICA operation. Postoperatively regional CBF improved in 2 patients only. Hence the intellectual improvement could not be related to changes in CBF. Intellectual deterioration in patients with internal carotid atherosclerosis may be delayed or terminated by surgical abolition of the source of multiple cerebral embolizations.
