Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences compared to a conventional dual-echo spin-echo (SE) sequence in routine brain MRI at 1.0 T. The following demands were made on TSE sequences: acquisition time-reduction of at least 50% and true proton density (PD) contrast (low-signal cerebrospinal fluid). A conventional spin-echo and two single-echo TSE sequences were used in 150 patients, a dual-echo TSE sequence in addition in 50 patients. Demonstration of most anatomical structures and disorders was equivalent with TSE and SE sequences. Advantages of TSE were reduced flow artefacts on T2-weighted images, better lesion contrast on PD-weighted TSE images (especially in the dual-echo sequence) and acquisition time reduction to about 5 min (single-echo TSE) and 3:35 min (dual-echo TSE). Disadvantages of TSE were: reduced contrast of iron-containing substances such as haemosiderin and of areas of calcification. By virtue of the shorter acquisition time and diagnostic reliability dual-echo TSE proved the best sequence. If it is used with only one acquisition--whereby image quality but not diagnostic reliability is slightly decreased--acquisition time can be further reduced to 1:48 min. Application of a susceptibility-sensitive gradient-echo sequence, such as FLASH, compensates for the disadvantages mentioned above.
