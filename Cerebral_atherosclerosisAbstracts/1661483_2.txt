A total systems approach was used to study the structural and functional properties of red blood cells in 100 patients suffering from atherosclerotic circulatory encephalopathy, stages I-III: aggregation, deformability, superficial cytoarchitectonics, the content of ATP and 2,3 DPH, transport of univalent cations, and the cholesterol/phospholipid index of membranes. It has been demonstrated that as the atherosclerotic process progresses, the membrane rigidity increases as a result of excessive concentration of cholesterol in the cell, aggregation is enhanced, transport of ions and substances gets disturbed, the processes of glycolysis and synthesis of macroergs get inhibited. All this brings about the derangement of transport function of the cells because of disturbance of the properties of moving in the system of microcirculation.
