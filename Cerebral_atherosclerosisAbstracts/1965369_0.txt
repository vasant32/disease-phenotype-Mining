Scanning electron microscopy, impregnation, histochemical methods with acetylcholine esterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase and glyoxylic acid were used for studying elements of afferent and efferent (+ adrenergic and cholinergic) innervation of pial arteries 450-60 microns in diameter in persons with "preclinical" atherosclerosis. Marked changes of the nervous system were found in arteries of large calibre. Disorders were seen in afferent innervation with increased crimp in nervous fibers, alternate patches of hypo- and hyperimpregnation, thickening with a high AChE activity, reactive changes in receptors. The structure of choline- and adrenergic nervous plexuses was disordered; the concentration of nervous fibers and varicosities in particular in fluorescent plexuses was decreased, with a moderate increase in the concentration of these structures being seen in cholinergic plexuses.
