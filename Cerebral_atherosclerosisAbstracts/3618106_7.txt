Five patients with variable clinical symptoms were diagnosed as having--subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger disease) based on the presence of lacunar infarcts in basal ganglia, various abnormalities of subcortical white matter and severe thickening and hyalinization of penetrating arteries and arterioles. One case had a classical clinical picture while in the others the course of the disease was short and was associated with severe systemic abnormalities. The variability of the clinical features, the identify of "classical" clinical symptoms with other forms of cerebral arteriosclerosis, the similarity between "atypical" cases and other entities, and the high frequency of associated conditions makes it difficult to characterize the clinical pathological entity called subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy.
