Pure or predominantly sensory transient ischemic attacks (ps-TIAs) are uncommon, and underlying vascular abnormalities have rarely been described. The author reports 5 patients with TIAs which were of short duration, stereotypical and purely or predominantly sensory in nature. Brain MRI did not reveal any lesions, while angiography demonstrated focal stenoses in the proximal portion of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). It is concluded that ps-TIAs strongly suggest the presence of PCA disease. Repeated compromise of small vessels supplying the posterior-lateral part of the thalamus seems to be the pathogenic mechanism.
