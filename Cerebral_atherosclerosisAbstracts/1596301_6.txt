Serum elastase-type activity, elastase inhibitory capacity and their relation to lipids were examined in 140 male patients with ischemic vascular disease (coronary, cerebral, peripheral) and in 60 control subjects. In a further 24 patients with acute myocardial infarction elastase activity, inhibitory capacity and lipids during the course of the illness have also been investigated. Serum elastase-type activity was found to be significantly lower and inhibitory capacity significantly higher in the groups of patients than in the controls. HDL- and HDL2-cholesterol as well as apo A concentration showed significant negative correlation with elastase inhibitory capacity both in atherosclerotic and in control subjects. During the course of myocardial infarction a significant elevation of serum elastase-type activity could be observed at the end of the first week; serum triglyceride levels increased, HDL- and HDL2-concentrations decreased significantly in the first 3 weeks, than gradually approached the initial values. In the patients with an elevation of serum elastase-like activity by more than 30% in the first week, there was a significantly higher elevation of serum GOT and LDH1 and a greater occurrence of transmural (Q) infarction than in those with a smaller variation of elastase-like activity.
