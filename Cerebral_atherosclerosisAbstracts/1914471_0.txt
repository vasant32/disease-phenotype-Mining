In 2043 autopsies divided into the high (HAG) and low (LAG) atherosclerosis group a set of variables of a new atherometric system (AS) was used to characterize the atherosclerotic lesion (AL) in the circle of Willis arteries: fatty streaks (X), fibrous plaques (Y), severe plaques (Z), index of stenosis (P) and index of benignity (B). Principal component analysis identified a first component of severity (Y, P and Z) and a second component of benignity (X and B). Fibrous plaques play the main role in the severity of AL in the circle of Willis. The new AS proved its usefulness in characterizing the state of AL, whereas discriminant analysis and AS distinguished between the HAG and the LAG. The classification was correct in 74.5% and 76.5% when using three (X, Y, Z) and five (X, Y, Z, P, B) variables, respectively.
