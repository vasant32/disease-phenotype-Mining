In some cases, human middle cerebral artery segments reacted to vasoconstrictor stimuli, including noradrenaline, KCL, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and activated platelets and neutrophils, by showing abnormally long-term contraction. All the segments were atherosclerotic, the atherosclerotic patch constricting the lumen to 30%-50%. Vasodilator concentrations that remove the ordinary contraction of vessels, only slightly limited the abnormal spastic reaction. A positive interaction between nifedipine and prostacyclin was revealed, and their combined use had a more marked anti-spasmatic effect than when these agents were used separately.
