Early detection of stenosis is an important task in noninvasive examinations. The authors analyzed 50 patients with diabetic macroangiopathy in lower limbs, but without signs, or symptoms of brain ischemia, and 50 supposedly healthy subjects of similar sex and age composition as control. Eight hemodynamic parameters were measured in the common carotid artery using Doppler ultrasound with spectral analysis. Only 6% of the control group, but 64% of the diabetic patients had two or more altered parameters. The authors conclude that persons with high risk of cerebrovascular disease could be identified by Doppler ultrasound examination of common carotid artery.
