We report a patient with long-standing systemic hypertension who developed progressive generalized chorea and dementia beginning at 70 years of age with no family history or other features to suggest Huntington's disease. At postmortem examination, congophilic angiopathy and atherosclerosis causing neostriatal neuronal loss and gliosis were found, in addition to plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the cortex. This case is a rare demonstration of a vascular pathology causing late onset generalized chorea in association with dementia due to Alzheimer's-type cortical changes.
