A case of so-called Japanese cerebrovascular disease in association with intracerebral haematoma is presented. The patient had had no neurological symptoms before the onset, in spite of an extensive intracranial occlusive vascular process. Diagnosis was established preoperatively and massive haematoma was surgically evacuated from the left frontal lobe. The postoperative course was uneventful and residual neurological deficit was minimal.
