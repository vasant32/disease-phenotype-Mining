Plasma lipoproteins in 30 patients of cortical infarction and 20 patients of lacunar infarction were estimated to study the relation of plasma lipids to the risk for ischaemic stroke by comparing clinical and biochemical characteristics of survivors. No significant differences were observed in the concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins in both the groups. However patients with lacunar infarction had higher concentrations of high density lipoproteins as compared to patients with cortical infarction. These data suggest that previously demonstrated differences in HDL concentration between patients with ischaemic stroke and control subjects without stroke may be true for patients with cortical infarction but not for patients of lacunar infarction.
