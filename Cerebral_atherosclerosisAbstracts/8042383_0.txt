Based on the results of a many-year dynamic follow-up of 151 patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy (DE), the authors distinguish six variants of its clinical course: stable, slowly progressing without paroxysms or transient disorders of brain circulation (TDBC), slowly progressing with paroxysms, that with TDBC, intermittent, rapidly progressing. The two former variants are referred to the favorable type of DE course, the rest are considered unfavorable. The major risk factors in the patients with the favorable and unfavorable patterns of DE were studied, as well as the contribution of these factors to the development of DE. In male patients the factors conductive to the development of an unfavorable DE course were psychoemotional stress, hypokinesia, alcohol abuse, the presence of two or more concomitant somatic diseases and the absence of regular therapy; in women such factors were psychoemotional stress, excessive body mass, arterial hypertension, the presence of two or more concomitant somatic diseases, and a family history of cardiovascular diseases. A method for predicting the DE course, based on a discriminant analysis of the risk factors, has been developed, that will essentially improve the efficacy of therapeutic and prophylactic measures in such patients.
