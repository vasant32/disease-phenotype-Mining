 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to present 12-month follow-up results for a series of patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting with the Gateway-Wingspan stenting system (Boston Scientific) for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial atherostenosis. METHODS: Clinical and angiographic follow-up results were recorded for patients from 5 participating institutions. Primary end points were stroke or death within 30 days of the stenting procedure or ipsilateral stroke after 30 days. RESULTS: During a 21-month study period, 158 patients with 168 intracranial atherostenotic lesions (50% to 99%) were treated with the Gateway-Wingspan system. The average follow-up duration was 14.2 months with 143 patients having at least 3 months of clinical follow-up and 110 having at least 12 months. The cumulative rate of the primary end point was 15.7% for all patients and 13.9% for patients with high-grade (70% to 99%) stenosis. Of 13 ipsilateral strokes occurring after 30 days, 3 resulted in death. Of these strokes, 76.9% (10 of 13) occurred within the first 6 months of the stenting procedure and no events were recorded after 12 months. An additional 9 patients experienced ipsilateral transient ischemic attack after 30 days. Most postprocedural events (86%) could be attributed to interruption of antiplatelet medications (n=6), in-stent restenosis (n=12), or both (n=1). In 3 patients, the events were of uncertain etiology. CONCLUSIONS: After successful Wingspan percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting, some patients continued to experience ipsilateral ischemic events. Most of these ischemic events occurred within 6 months of the procedure and were associated with the interruption of antiplatelet therapy or in-stent restenosis.
