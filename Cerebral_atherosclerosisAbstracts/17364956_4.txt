 OBJECTIVES: The goal of our study was to investigate the associations of oxidized LDL (apoB100 aldehyde-modified form) and acute phase proteins (fibrinogen, CRP) with acute ischemic stroke severity and outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 61 ischemic stroke patients and 64 controls. Strokes were subtyped according to TOAST criteria, the severity and outcome of stroke (at 1 year) were measured. RESULTS: The mean triglyceride, fibrinogen, CRP and glucose values were significantly higher among cases. The median oxLDL value for patients with large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) type of stroke was significantly higher than for other subtypes. The oxLDL values did not correlate with age, stroke severity and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory markers (fibrinogen and CRP) predicted the stroke severity and outcome whereas elevation of oxLDL levels did not. Our data refer to possibility that there may exist some links between the LAA subtype of stroke and elevated oxLDL (apoB100 aldehyde-modified form).
