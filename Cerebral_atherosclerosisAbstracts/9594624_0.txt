BACKGROUND: It is difficult to predict ischemic cerebrovascular diseases by noninvasive methods before overt symptoms develop. Advanced carotid and cerebral atherosclerosis reduce common carotid blood flow volume due to increased resistance of peripheral circulation. According to a study in which clinical and pathological specimens were compared, the lower threshold for the flow volume in normal individuals has been confirmed to be 6.5 ml/s. We investigated the possibility that the development of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases can be predicted based on blood flow volume. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study on 314 patients who were available for determination of common carotid blood flow volume with an ultrasonic quantitative flowmeter. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients developed ischemic cerebrovascular attacks during the observation period (onset group), while the remaining 281 did not develop attacks (non-onset group). The discriminating value for common carotid blood flow volume between the onset and non-onset groups was 6.8 ml/s. Based on an odds ratio of 6.7, it was concluded that a common carotid blood flow volume of less than 6.8 ml/s is highly likely to predict the onset of ischemic cerebrovascular accidents.
