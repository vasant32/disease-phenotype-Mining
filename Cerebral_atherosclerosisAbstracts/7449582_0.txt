Using newly devised barium-contrasted Sudan staining methods (BCSS method) for the macroscopic overall detection of cerebrovascular ring-like fat deposition, we investigated, qualitatively and quantitatively, the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the development of atherogenesis in the cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), renal infarction hypertensive rats (RHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKR). Upper cervical sympathectomy clearly reduced the susceptibility to vascular fat deposition in the central nervous system of SHR and WKR. In contrast, denervated and intact RHR showed no significant difference in the susceptibility to vascular fat deposition. Susceptibility and degree of the denervation effect were dependent on differences among the strains of SHR. These results suggest the important role of neural factors and genetic disposition, in addition to hypertension, in the initiation of cerebrovascular atherogenesis in rats.
