We studied the association of endothelin (ET)-1 with carotid atherosclerosis and asymptomatic cerebrovascular lesions in patients with essential hypertension. Neurologically normal patients with essential hypertension (n=293; 138 male, 155 female; mean age, 65 years) and age-matched control subjects (n=242) were studied with B-mode ultrasonography of the common and internal carotid arteries and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Plasma ET-1 was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Hypertensive patients were divided into groups with carotid plaques and low ET-1 concentrations (< 0.75 pg/ml; PL group); carotid plaques and mid-range ET-1 (0.75 to 1.55 pg/ml; PM group); carotid plaques and high ET-1 (> or = 1.55 pg/ml; PH group); no plaques and low ET-1 (NPL); no plaques and mid-range ET-1 (NPM); and no plaques and high ET-1 (NPH). Overall, ET-1 concentrations were significantly higher in patients than in control subjects. Carotid plaque prevalence was significantly related to ET-1 in hypertensive patients. ET-1 showed a significant positive relationship with the number of asymptomatic lacunar infarcts of the brain in hypertensive patients with carotid plaques (rho=0.48, p<0.001). No significant relationship was seen between ET-1 and periventricular hyperintensity scores in patients with plaques. ET-1 did not show a relationship to either brain lesion type in patients without carotid plaques. Thus, ET-1 may foster asymptomatic lacunar cerebral infarcts by promoting carotid atherosclerosis in patients with essential hypertension.
