 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to identify factors associated with stroke recurrence after an initial minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in a prospective hospital-series. METHODS: Included in the series were 689 patients with NIHSS lower than 4 at hospital admission. The end point was a new neurological event (worsening >/=4 points in the initial NIHSS was considered as recurrence) at 90 days (and additionally at 7 days). Factors based on two previous reported scores (ABCD and SPI-II) were analyzed in relation with stroke recurrence: age, duration of symptoms >1 hour, weakness, speech impairment, initial hypertension, hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, minor stroke versus TIA, prior stroke, and heart failure. We also analyzed: gender, hyperlipidemia, severe alcohol intake (>60gr/d), current smoking habits, peripheral arterial disease, atrial fibrillation, acute lesion in initial head computed tomography, severe symptomatic extra or intracranial arterial disease (SSAD; arterial stenosis >/=70%), previous TIA, and vertebrobasilar event. Patients were also analyzed separately according to diagnosis of TIA or minor stroke. RESULTS: 90-day recurrence occurred in 111 patients (16.1%), whereas 62 patients had 7-day recurrence (9%). The independent variables associated with 90-day recurrence were: SSAD (OR=4.97), weakness (OR=3.25), speech impairment (OR=1.96), severe alcohol intake (OR=4.18), heart failure (OR=2.41), previous TIA (OR=4.62), and vertebrobasilar events (OR=2.87). SSAD was independently associated with 7-day recurrence (OR=7.73) and also for TIA (OR=3.45) and minor stroke (OR=5.15) patients. CONCLUSIONS: An arterial study to discard SSAD would be necessary, in combination with clinical factors, to improve the identification of patients with a higher risk of 90-day recurrence after an initial minor stroke or TIA.
