This study was carried out on 49 patients who underwent an ultrasound study by continuous Doppler and echotomography B real-time, an angiography of supra-aortic arteries, and a carotid endarterectomy. Thirteen had had transient ischemic attacks and 20 a stroke. A quantification of the carotid stenosis in 4 stages was established for each method. For detection of lesion an excellent correlation was observed between the results of echotomography and pathology. For the quantification of lesion the correlation between echotomography and pathology was excellent also in 79,7 p. 100 of the cases, discordant in 20,3 p. 100. It was similar to the correlation between arteriography and pathology (excellent in 83 p. 100 of the cases). The correlation with pathology enabled to distinguish for stages of atherosclerotic lesions, to clarify their type of complications, and to evaluate their functional significance, particularly those with a high risk of embolism.
