 OBJECTIVE: To estimate the psychological health status of attacking stage patients with cerebral arterial sclerosis(CAS). METHODS: Sixty in-patients were surveyed by filling up the questionnaire (SCL-90) and compared with the customary model in China. RESULTS: The symptomatic factor scores of somatization and depression of the patients were obviously higher than those of the customary model (P < 0.001). Their symptomatic factor scores of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive were higher than those of the customary model (P < 0.05). The symptomatic factor score of phobic anxiety was higher than that of the customary model (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety and phobic anxiety are common psychological problems. Corresponding nursing countermeasures are proposed in our study.
