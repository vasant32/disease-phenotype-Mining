The clinicopathologic features of two Japanese sisters with cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CARASIL) are described. Neither patient had a history of hypertension, and both experienced cerebrovascular events before reaching their forties. Severe degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and knee joints were seen on radiographs. MRI showed extensive cerebral white matter lesions, which revealed remarkable arteriosclerotic changes on autopsy.
