Elderly patients are problem patients, especially as far as the selection of the best therapy is concerned. The reduction of cerebral efficiency is caused by a reduced metabolism and blood circulation of the brain. Extracerebral disturbing factors comprise obstructions of the vascular system, disturbances of the pumping action of the heart, changes of blood pressure and a lack of substrates. The symptoms are of a great variety, they may occur in a slowly progressive or an acute form. The pacemaker treatment shows the close connection between diseases of heart and circulation and the cerebral vascular circulation. This treatment improves the contraction of the heart, but it also causes an improvement of the cerebral vascular situation, especially in patients with chronical bradycardiac arrhythmias, demonstrated by a series of EEG investigations and clinical controls. New methods of "physiological" heart stimulations are important in patients having cerebralsclerotic disturbances, whereby the collaboration between cardiologists and neurologists should be intensified.
