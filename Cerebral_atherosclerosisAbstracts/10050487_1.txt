Results are submitted of employment of microwave resonance therapy (MRT) in 204 patients presenting with prestroke forms of atherosclerosis-related cerebrovascular pathology. According to the analysis of the data obtained, a major proportion of patients demonstrated an improvement in clinical and paraclinical indices (regression of neurological symptoms, intensification of synthesis of high-density lipiproteids up to 77 +/- 14% as compared with the norm (P < 0.05); rise in T-lymphocytes up to 79.8 +/- 0.9% (P < 0.05); improvement in electrophysiological and thermographic determinants), with 65 percent of patients versus only 20 percent of controls being in remission for about one year.
