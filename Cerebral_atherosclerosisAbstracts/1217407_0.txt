The author presents the results of a parallel study of the sympathetico-adrenal system state and blood coagulation in 140 patients with hypertensive disease, cerebral atherosclerosis and initial arterial hypotensive disease with cerebro-vascular crises. An increase of catecholamine excretion with the urine and of blood coagulation in the majority of the patients during the crisis was found. The activity of the sympathetico-adrenal system was higher due to the hormonal chain (the quantity of excreted adrenalin exceeded the noradrenalin quantity). The obtained data testified to a possible participation of the sympathetico-adrenal system in the appearance of hypercoagulational tendencies of the blood and to a development of cerebrovascular crisis.
