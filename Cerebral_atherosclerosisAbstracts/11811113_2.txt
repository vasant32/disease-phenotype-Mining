A new form of garlic preparation--long-acting tablets of garlic powder allicor has been studied in patients with cerebral atherosclerosis (CA) complicated by chronic cerebrovascular pathology. A double blind placebo-controlled trial examined allicor effects on hemostasis and fibrinolysis in cross-over groups at two stages. At the first stage patients of group 1 (n = 15) received allicor in a dose 600 mg/day; patients of group 2 (n = 14) were given placebo. At the second stage group 1 received place and group 2 allicor in the same regimen. Before the treatment allicor effects on platelet aggregation and fibrinolysis were studied in vitro (20 patients). Allicor significantly inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo, reduced blood fibrinogen, normalized initially low fibrinolytic activity and fibrinolysis index. Due to the above properties allicor can be used for prevention and treatment of CA complicated by chronic cerebrovascular pathology.
