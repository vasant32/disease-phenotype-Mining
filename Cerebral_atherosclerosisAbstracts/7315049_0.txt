The author analyzes the clinical and rheoencephalographic characteristics of the cerebral circulation in 252 patients with initial signs of cerebral circulation insufficiency, 198 patients with the initial stage of dyscirculatory encephalopathy due to atherosclerosis, and in 149 healthy subjects of a young age. Distinct criteria for differentiating the above groups have been defined. These criteria are necessary for developing an automated system of prophylactic examinations of population.
