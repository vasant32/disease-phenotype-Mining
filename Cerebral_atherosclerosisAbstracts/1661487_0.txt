It is shown that in patients with cerebral circulatory disorders, the prostacyclin -thromboxane balance is replaced toward the latter one. As a result of nifedipine administration part of the test subjects demonstrate a rise of the content of prostacyclin and a decline of the concentration of thromboxane. This effect of nifedipine is ascertained to be in a good agreement with its action on blood inflow to the brain and platelet aggregation. It is concluded that the efficacy of nifedipine can be raised if it is combined with the drugs that enhance the synthesis of prostacyclins in the body.
