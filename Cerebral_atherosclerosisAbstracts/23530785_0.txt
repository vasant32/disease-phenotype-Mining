Interventional neuroradiology is a rapidly expanding field, and the complexity and duration of these procedures makes anaesthetic support essential to their success. Such has been the development in this area, that the American Heart Association has published a scientific statement on the indications for these procedures. A detailed understanding of patient pathology, the technical aspects of the interventions and their associated risks, and the remote location in which they are performed are important for providing expert anaesthetic care. The aim of this article is to provide a description and contemporary analysis of the common interventional neuroradiology procedures relevant to the anaesthetist. This article will cover the management of intracranial aneurysms, cerebral vasospasm following intracranial haemorrhage, intracranial and spinal arteriovenous malformations, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, carotid artery stenting, intra-arterial thrombolysis for stroke and endovascular treatment of intracranial atherosclerosis. Protection from ionising radiation and acute kidney injury are also discussed.
