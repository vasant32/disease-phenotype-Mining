Angiographic diagnosis of atheromatous plaques is usually well correlated with surgical and pathologic findings. Hemorrhage into such plaques is believed to be frequent, but is seldom diagnosed angiographically. The authors report a case of intramural hemorrhage into an atheromatous plaque with subsequent resolution. A brain scan of a woman, age 52, with right hemiparesis and dysphasia showed increased isotope uptake in the left frontotemporal region. Arteriography 10 days after onset of symptoms showed a plaque in the left carotid bifurcation. Clinical improvement followed. Repeat arteriography 12 weeks later revealed almost normal left carotid bifurcation.
