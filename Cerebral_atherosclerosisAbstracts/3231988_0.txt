100 patients with cerebro-vascular disease, characterized by an acute episode, were explored by TC to examine the etiopathogenesis of cerebral damage of the periventricular white substance, correlated with Binswanger disease. Only 7 patients showed typical bilateral lesions of the periventricular white substance. All these patients, except for one, were over seventy. The same percentage was verified in patients more than 70 years old without cerebral vascular disease. In our series the only patient with mental impairment showed very serious lesions of the periventricular white substance.
