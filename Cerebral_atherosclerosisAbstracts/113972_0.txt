A clinical analysis of focal epileptic attacks in 18 patients with ischemic disturbances of blood circulation in the zone of mixed blood supply by the frontal and median cerebral arteries was carried out. The epileptic attacks observed were found to be due to irritation of the frontal adversive and pre-moter fields. Focal clonic convulsions in the foot due to irritation of the brain paracentral lobule were also observed. The versatility of the clinical forms of the epileptic attacks was determined mainly by the involvement of particular cytoarchitectonic fields of the frontal lobe of the brain (8th, 6th, 4th) belonging to the zone of mixed blood supply by the frontal and median cerebral arteries and provided with blood by different cortical branches of those arteries. Clinico-angiographic and clinico-morphological comparisons showed that in most patients with focal epileptic attacks there was combined involvement of the internal carotid arteries.
