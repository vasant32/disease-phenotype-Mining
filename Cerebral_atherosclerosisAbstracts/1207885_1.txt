The femoral artery approach to cerebral angiography has become well accepted. Some patients, however, are not candidates for femoral catheterization because of severe arteriosclerosis. One hundred cerebral angiograms were performed in 88 severely arteriosclerotic patients, using No. 5 French polyethylene catheters and the axillary approach. The technique, degree of success, patient population, and their complications are described. This approach allows selective vertebral and internal carotid artery injections. Only one serious complication occurred, thrombosis of the axillary artery. Because of the time saved, this technique is often preferable to the femoral approach in severely arteriosclerotic patients.
