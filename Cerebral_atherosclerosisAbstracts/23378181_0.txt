OPINION STATEMENT: Understanding the anatomical pathways and clinical presentations for VBI are of the utmost importance due to the potential mimics that may occur. After identification of the entity, imaging must be performed to identify the etiology. Distinguishing external compression of the vertebral artery from intrinsic vascular disease due to atherosclerosis or dissection is critical to aid the clinician in the therapeutic decision tree. Patients with an external compression due to an osteophyte may benefit from definitive surgical decompression and excision of the bony structure. Patients with extracranial disease of the vertebral artery who have failed maximal medical therapy may benefit from angioplasty and stenting which appears to carry a low morbidity. Extracranial vertebral artery dissections can be treated with medical therapy using anti-platelet agents or on occasion anti-coagulation. Rarely, endovascular options are required if a patient is having hemodynamic stroke or TIAs due to flow failure. In such circumstances, stenting and angioplasty may be considered. Intracranial atherosclerosis is best managed with maximal medical therapy due to the high rate of complications attributable to stenting and angioplasty.
