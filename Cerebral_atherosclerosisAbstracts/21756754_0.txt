 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the predictors of Wingspan in-stent restenosis (ISR) for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis. METHODS: Between January 2007 and November 2009, 42 patients with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis registered in Nanjing stroke registry program (NSRP) were treated with Wingspan stent system. Clinical and follow-up results were retrospectively analyzed. They were divided into the non-restenosis and restenosis groups according to their follow-up imaging data. ISR was defined as > 50% stenosis within 5 mm or adjacent to stent or an absolute luminal loss > 20%. The analysis of stepwise multivariate Cox regression was performed to evaluate the independent predictive factors. RESULTS: ISR was found in 15 patients (15/42, 35.7%) with 16 lesions (16/43, 37.2%) at a median follow-up period of 7 months (range: 4 - 23). Diabetes (HR = 0.281; 95%CI = 0.088 - 0.898; P = 0.032) and stent diameter (HR = 0.213; 95%CI = 0.049 - 0.918; P = 0.038) were two independent predictors for ISR. CONCLUSION: Diabetes and stent diameter may be two independent predictors for ISR after a treatment of Wingspan system.
