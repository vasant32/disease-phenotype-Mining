Platelet activation is an important process in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis. However, the serial changes of platelet activation in atherosclerotic ischemic stroke have not been determined. In this study, we measured serially platelet expression of CD63 and P-selectin and platelet aggregability to ADP and collagen. Measurements were made 24 and 72 h and 7 and 90 days after the ischemic event in 29 patients with atherosclerotic ischemic stroke. Platelet aggregability was significantly decreased after 72 h compared to that at 24 h of stroke onset. However, platelet CD63 and P-selectin expression remained high even 90 days after the events. These findings suggest that platelet hyperactivation in atherosclerotic ischemic stroke may be sustained for a considerable period.
