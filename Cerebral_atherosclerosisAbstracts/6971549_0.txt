In 42 patients with ischemic cerebral stroke, the state of the kallikrein-kinin system of the blood was analyzed by three main parameters: total esterase activity, prekallikrein content, and activity of the kallikrein inhibitor. Two blood specimens were taken (from the femoral artery and the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein) at the peak of the stroke acute period. An activation of the kallikrein-kinin system was revealed, the degree of which was found to depend on the gravity of the pathological process in the brain. At the initial stages of the disease a moderate activation of the kallikrein-kinin system was noted, the fact, that was, probably, favourable for improvement of the blood circulation. Possible pathogenetic mechanisms (hypoxia, lowering of the medium pH, etc.) of the system activation are discussed. For treating patients who were in a soporous-comatose state with a sharp drop of the kallikrein activity in the cerebral venous blood it was recommended to use drugs blocking the excess formation of kinins. At the initial stage of the disease development such an intervention should be regarded undesirable.
