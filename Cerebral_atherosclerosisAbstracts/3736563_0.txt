Calcium influences the cerebral artery system not only through its action on the contractile state of the vessels' SMC, but also acts in the regulation of transendothelial transports of macromolecules. Additionally it plays a decisive role in migration and proliferation of SMC during the formation of atheromas. By means of calcium entry blockers used in vivo and in cultures of SMC and fibroblasts the significance of calcium for pathophysiological reactions of the cerebrovascular system is elucidated.
