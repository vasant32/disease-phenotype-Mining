 INTRODUCTION: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease is one of the major risk factors of ischemic stroke. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent deployment may be effective for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis, however its value is yet to be determined. High possibility of serious periprocedural complications, such as acute in-stent thrombosis or stroke, narrows the current recommendations for this treatment to patients with high-grade stenosis (>70%), and to experienced neurointerventional centers. CASE REPORT: We present a 44-year-old male with symptomatic high-grade stenosis of the M1 segment of left middle cerebral artery, treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting. The procedure was complicated with acute in-stent thrombosis treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis, which resulted in a nondisabling stroke. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure-related stroke in this patient was probably caused by middle cerebral artery perforator ostium occlusion with balloon predilatation and transient in-stent thrombosis related to insufficient antiplatelet pretreatment. Exhausted cerebrovascular reserve due to long-lasting high-grade intracranial stenosis should also be considered as a factor contributing to ischemic complications.
