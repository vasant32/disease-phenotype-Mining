Juvenile distal cerebral ischemia has been attributed to small artery atherosclerosis (Arnold, Benoit, Merlen, Dobbelaere, Delandsheer, 1979), based on clinicopathologic findings in one male patient and results of big toe pulp biopsy in three other cases. Pathological findings were obstruction of small artery lumens by hypertrophic endothelium and loose fibrocellular bands, their origin being the result possibly of partial intimalization of media by elastic neogenesis. Appearances were similar to those described by Dahl in human cerebral atherosclerosis in 1976, and approached those of the initial stages of experimental atheroma (Ross, Glomset, 1976). Arterial exiguity was also present in the 4 cases. Results of biologic, metabolic, inflammatory and immunologic examinations were negative. The present study concerns 4 additional cases of juvenile distal encephalic ischemia. One case in a female patient not on oral contraceptives confirmed the hypothesis of intimalization of media of arterioles of big toe pulp. Elastic neogenesis was present in the tunica media in areas where there was a change of direction of myocytes, and was apparent at a distance from the internal elastic layer. The latter was fragmented, sometimes doubles and of variable color. In another case, a woman taking oral contraceptives, there was almost total obstruction of the pulp arteriolar lumens with a very thin tunica media. Elastic neogenesis encircled two very narrow lumens in the center of the vessel and there were also elastic changes common to both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
