OBJECTIVE: To observe the changes in hypertensive cerebral arteriosclerosis and the incidence of stroke in rats following treatment with Tanakan, a preparation of Ginkgo Biloba (GB). METHODS: Using two-kidney, two clip renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRs) as animal models--we investigated changes in these hypertensive arteriosclerosis-associated factors: A I, A II, ALD, ET, SOD and cGMP. Blood levels were observed after oral administration of GB, at both early and late stages of hypertension. RESULTS: The degree of arteriosclerosis was more severe in both RHRs control and the later treated group than in the early treated group, with blood levels of A I, A II, ALD and ET in the former two groups significantly elevated. The degree of arteriosclerosis in the early treated group decreased and the blood levels of A I, A II, ALD and ET in this group decreased nearly to normal levels. The blood levels of SOD and cGMP were also elevated in the early treated group. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal that it is important to treat hypertension as soon as possible, in order to reduce the occurrence of stroke.
