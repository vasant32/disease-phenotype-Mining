"The Clinical Memory Test" was administered to 40 elderly patients with cerebral arteriosclerosis (group A), compared with 40 aged subjects as control (group B), all subjects of both groups were over 60 year old. The results indicate: MQ, directed memory, free recall of pictures and paired-association learning in group A were found significantly less than in group B. This shows the ability of active recall, memory and learning of abstract ideas decreased in the patients of cerebral arterlosclerosis, but it's only quantitative difference between groups A and B, there was not qualitative difference.
