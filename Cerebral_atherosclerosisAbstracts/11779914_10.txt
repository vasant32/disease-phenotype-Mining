BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors, atherosclerotic disease in the carotid bifurcation, and the risk of stroke and mortality in a representative population sample. METHODS: One hundred forty-two men and women participated in a population study at ages 70 and 76 years. At age 78, extracranial and intracranial circulation was examined by means of duplex sonography and transcranial Doppler techniques. Mortality and hospitalization for stroke were analyzed over a 5-year follow-up period up to age 83 years. RESULTS: Carotid plaques were identified in 82% of the men and 79% of the women. Bilateral plaques were found in 57% of the men and 46% of the women, and stenosis resulting in >50% diameter reduction occurred in 28% of the men and 17% of the women. Carotid stenosis >75% was observed in 7 subjects (0.5%). Bilateral plaques at age 78 were correlated with systolic blood pressure and ischemic heart disease at age 70 years. The pulsatility index was 1.0 to 1.4 in 63% and > or =1.5 in 13% of the study population. The pulsatility index was correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides. Men with bilateral carotid plaques at age 78 years had an increased risk of stroke or mortality during the 5-year follow-up period (74% bilateral plaques versus 21% unilateral or no plaques). This was not found in the women (33% versus 26%). CONCLUSIONS: Carotid atherosclerosis was prevalent in a majority of elderly subjects. Bilateral plaques were correlated with systolic blood pressure and ischemic heart disease at age 70 years and predicted the risk of stroke and mortality in men but not in women.
