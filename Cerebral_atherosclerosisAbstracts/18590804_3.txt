 BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which plays an essential role in plasma lipoprotein metabolism and transportation, appears to be a risk factor for ischemic vascular diseases. Several studies have recently reported the presence of relationship between HindIII, PvuII, Ser447Ter (C-->G) polymorphisms of LPL and ischemic vascular diseases. PURPOSE: We first studied the relationship between LPL polymorphisms and the risk of atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (CI) by detecting the frequencies of LPL HindIII, PvuII and Ser447Ter genotypes and combined genotypes in the Chinese. METHODS: We recruited 185 CI patients, confirmed by cranial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging/angiography, or both, and 186 control subjects. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms technique was used to detect HindIII, PvuII and Ser447Ter polymorphisms of the LPL gene. RESULTS: The frequencies of the H+H+ genotype and H+ allele did not differ between CI and control groups. The frequencies of the P+P+ genotype and P+ allele gene were significantly higher in the CI group (P=0.040, P=0.015). The frequencies of CG+GG genotype and G allele were lower in the CI group (P<0.001, P<0.001). In the CI group, the individuals with P+P+ genotype had a significantly higher level of plasma triglyceride (TG) and a lower level of plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). CG+GG genotypes were correlated with significantly higher levels of plasma total cholesterol (TC), HDL-c and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in the CI group. The frequencies of H+/C and P+/C combined genotypes were higher in the CI group than in controls (P<0.001, P<0.001). The frequency of H+/P+/C combined genotype was significantly higher in the CI group than in controls (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that PvuII and Ser447Ter polymorphisms are associated with lipid profile and CI.
