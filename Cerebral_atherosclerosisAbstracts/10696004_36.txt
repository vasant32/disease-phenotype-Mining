BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The safe performance of percutaneous transluminal cerebral angioplasty for intracranial atherosclerotic lesions requires that the risk of complications, such as acute occlusion or symptomatic dissection, and restenosis be reduced. Our purpose was to assess the effectiveness, safety, and short-term arteriographic and clinical outcome of cerebral angioplasty and stenting (CAS) for intracranial vertebrobasilar and distal internal carotid atherosclerotic occlusive lesions. METHODS: Between March 1998 and November 1998, 10 patients with 12 intracranial atherosclerotic lesions of the vertebrobasilar artery and the distal internal carotid artery underwent treatment with flexible balloon-expandable coronary stents. RESULTS: Although in two of the 10 patients CAS was not successful because of the inability to access the site of arterial stenosis, 10 lesions in eight patients were successfully dilated with stents. No complications occurred during or after the procedure and no neurologic ischemic events or restenoses occurred during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: CAS appears to be a safe and effective means for treating intracranial atherosclerotic occlusive disease, yielding a favorable arteriographic and clinical outcome.
