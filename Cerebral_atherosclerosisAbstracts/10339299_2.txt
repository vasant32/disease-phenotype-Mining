The effect on survival of cerebral and lower extremity atherosclerosis was investigated in a cohort of individuals with known coronary artery disease. Those with cerebral and lower extremity atherosclerosis each had mortality ratios about 220% and extra death rates about 27. With the co-existence of both impairments the mortality ratio nearly doubled to 410% and the extra death rate increased to 71. In a group of individuals with known coronary artery disease, cerebral and lower extremity atherosclerosis have a major additional mortality impact.
