The results of carotid angiography in 304 cases of cerebral hemisphere infarction have been reviewed. Carotid occlusion was demonstrated in 19% and atheromatous vessel wall change in a further 28%. Hypertensive subjects showed a significantly lower prevalence of carotid occlusion, but a similar prevalence of vessel wall change. There was more likely to be angiographic abnormality if there was a neck bruit or if the ECG showed ischaemic changes. The findings support the concept that the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction differs in normotensive and hypertensive patients.
