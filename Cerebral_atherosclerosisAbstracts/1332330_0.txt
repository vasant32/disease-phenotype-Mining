A method of assessing relative changes in the head blood content under the influence of medicines is described. The method is based on an analysis of deviations of the equilibrium part of the radioactivity curve recorded with the aid of gamma-scintigraphy and injection in the form of bolus of the radiopharmaceutical agent 99mTc-pertechnetate to the ulnar vein. Changes in the blood content under the influence of nitroglycerin, duzodril, adalate and cavinton were examined in 37 patients suffering from dyscirculatory encephalopathy.
