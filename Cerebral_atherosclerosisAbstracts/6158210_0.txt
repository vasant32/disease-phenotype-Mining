In 102 patients with chronic cerebral circulation insufficiency (due to atherosclerosis in 70 and atherosclerosis plus arterial hypertension in 32 patients) the general hemodynamic parameters were examined using the method of Evans blue (T-1824) dilution in comparison with rheoencephalographic findings. In all the patients disturbances of the general and cerebral hemodynamics were revealed, these disturbances being more marked in the patients with atherosclerosis complicated with arterial hypertension. Rheopolyglucin combined with antospasmodics and cardiac glycosides was found to produce a beneficial effect on the rheological properties of the blood and the parameters of the general and cerebral circulation.
