One hundred thirty consecutive patients in whom the initial diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease was made on clinical basis were evaluated by cerebral computed tomographic (CCT) scan. Three of 20 patients with transient ischemic attacks were found to have an abnormality on CCT scan. Of 30 patients with an initial diagnosis of stroke-in-evolution, 13 were found to have a clinically unsuspected lesion by CCT scan. Of 60 patients with completed stroke, CCT scan made possible differentiation of intracerebral hematoma, hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic infarction, and excluded intracranial tumors. Of 20 patients believed to have symptoms of cerebral arteriosclerosis, six had nonvascular lesions and eight had a cerebral atrophic process. This study demonstrates the efficacy of this safe and noninvasive procedure in evaluating patients with cerebrovascular disease.
