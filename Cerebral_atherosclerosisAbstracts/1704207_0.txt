Nervous apparatus of the brain arteries (450-60 microns in diameter) in 55-64-year-old patients with cerebral atherosclerosis was studied. Alterations in the afferent innervation were manifested in the increased sinuosity of fibers, areas of hyper- and hypoimpregnation, appearance of thickenings in the fibers. Changes in the vasomotor innervation consisted of the disturbances of the nerve network structure, an increase of nerve fibers concentration and varicosity in the cholinergic plexuses and their decrease in the adrenergic ones. Restructurings of the nerve apparatus were more pronounced in the arteries of large caliber.
