During a period of 15 days, 90 geriatric patients with various disturbances in blood lipids and manifestations of cerebral arteriosclerosis ingested 1200 mg/d of N-2-(p-chlorophenoxy)-isobutryl-N'-morpholinomethylurea (plafibride, ITA 104). Its significant activity in decreasing the pre-beta-lipoproteins and increasing alpha-lipoproteins was demonstrated. At the same time plafibride inhibited platelet aggregation by 50%. The activity of plafibride was compared to those of clofibrate and the inactive placebo. A similar experiment was carried out with 44 geriatric patients comparing the clinico-therapeutic and biochemical benefits of plafibride in relation to clofibrate and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Apart from the biochemical results, the symptomatologic and eletroencephalographical results of the patients treated with plafibride was more significant and positive than with the other drugs. Plafibride also showed better gastric tolerance and a lower incidence of collateral effects than did clofibrate and ASA.
