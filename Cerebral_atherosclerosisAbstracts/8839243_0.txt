A case of a lichen planus-like eruption due to nicergorine on the lower legs of an 84-year-old woman is reported. She presented with slightly pruritic, erythematous plaques of six months' duration. She had taken eight kinds of drugs, including nicregorine for cerebral arteriosclerosis, for two years. After nicergorine was discontinued, the eruption gradually disappeared. Readministration of nicergorine induced a similar eruption within two months. Histologic findings were identical in the two biopsy specimens obtained at the first visit and from the recurrent lesion. To our knowledge, this is the first report on nicergorine-induced lichen planus-like eruptions.
