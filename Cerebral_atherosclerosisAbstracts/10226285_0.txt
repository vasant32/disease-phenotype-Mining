MR angiograms from 200 neurologically normal subjects aged 30 to 79 years were analyzed to assess the influence of aging and hypertension on the degree of the--visualization of the cerebral arteries. The degree of MR visualization of the cerebral arteries, including the IC, M 1, and distal MCA, was evaluated on a 4-degree scale. IC and M 1 differ in appearance. The MR gradings of each cerebral arteries showed a significant (p < 0.001) negative correlation with age. Hypertension, which is a risk factors for arteriosclerosis, significantly reduced MR grade. The degree of visualization of M 1 and the distal MCA decreased significantly with age in the normotensive group. Therefore, the decrease visualization of the cerebral arteries appears to involve not only cerebral arteriosclerosis but other factors associated with aging.
