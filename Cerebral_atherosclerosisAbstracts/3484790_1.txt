CT scanning performed before and sequentially during the inhalation of stable xenon (32%), coupled with end-tidal xenon measurements, has made possible the routine construction of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) maps with resolution that approximates that of the CT scanner. The capability of obtaining quantitative flow maps with direct anatomic correlation is now available with a commercial package of hardware and software adapted to the General Electric 9800 scanner. The ability to distinguish between normal and reduced rCBF in specific vascular territories has proved useful in the management of cerebrovascular disease. Specific clinical dilemmas that have been addressed with rCBF information from xenon-enhanced CT scanning include the following: In the patient with asymptomatic occlusive disease, is normal rCBF preserved? Is there adequate collateral flow? Are cerebrovascular symptoms a result of emboli or chronic regional low flow? In the patient with complex multivessel occlusive disease, which revascularization procedure is indicated first? Did operation improve rCBF? Should a further procedure be added? May a diffusely diseased but patent artery, which is the source of emboli, be sacrificed safely without compromising rCBF? On the basis of experience with 155 patients, the management and understanding of cerebrovascular disease has been aided substantially by the incorporation of rCBF mapping by xenon-enhanced CT scan in the evaluation of these patients.
