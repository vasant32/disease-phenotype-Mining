In three patients with cerebral ictal attacks, a diagnosis of a cerebral venous angioma was made, based on angiography, the symptoms and the clinical findings. All vascular malformations lay in the rostral cerebrum. In two patients, dilated medullary veins converge towards the origin of a dysplastic draining vein (type I), in the third case the medullary veins terminated in two veins of medium calibre which lead into a large venous drainage system (type II). In two of the three cases, there was calcification, one of these in a subeppendymal mass (? old haematoma). There was scintigraphic evidence of local disturbance of the bloodbrain barrier of Venous angiomas. The brain must be differentiated from other lesions, such as vascular gliomas and metastases.
