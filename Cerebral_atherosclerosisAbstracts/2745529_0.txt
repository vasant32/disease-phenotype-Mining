At 189 operations in 174 patients, carotid artery stump pressure (CSP) was measured serially to determine variability during carotid endarterectomy with eucarbic general anesthesia. Overall, 34 of 174 (19.5%) had significant variation in CSP which would have affected selective use of a bypass shunt based on CSP criteria. In those with CSP initially below 50 torr, 26 of 76 (34%) rose above 50 torr even, though systemic pressure was constant or declined. Eight of 113 pts (7%) with initial CSP equal to or above 50 torr subsequent had CSP below 50 torr. CSP did not vary as a function of age, sex, intracranial disease judged by biplanar arteriography, or contralateral carotid stenosis but did vary with preoperative status. Asymptomatic patients had CSP above 50 torr in a high proportion of cases, 24 of 27 (89%) unlike those with TIA, 72 of 116 (62%) or prior stroke, 17 of 31 (54%) (P = 0.003). We conclude that carotid stump pressure is variable in many patients which may account for some of the conflicting observations on the need for shunts in carotid surgery.
