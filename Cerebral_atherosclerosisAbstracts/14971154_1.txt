Combined atherosclerotic involvement of the brachiocephalic arteries (BCA) and lower limb arteries has been analysed in 107 patients (56 females and 51 males) with a verified diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (IHD). BCA atherosclerosis was detected in 83.9% females and 93.1% males. 75.8% examinees had no murmur. It is suggested that arterial hypertension and obesity in females with IHD may be risk factors of BCA kinking. Frequency of combined affection of extracranial arteries and lower limb arteries reached 23.2% females and 96% males. Therefore, it is necessary to screen these arteries for atherosclerosis in all IHD patients.
