Overall 106 patients with atherosclerotic cccccccirculatory encephalopathy (DE) were examined for changes in the EEG, REG and in certain psychological parameters (attention, memory, "associative" thinking) before and after acupuncture and carbon dioxide baths. In patients with stage I and stage II DE (in 93 and 80%, respectively), the clinical improvement was accompanied by positive changes such as a rise of alpha-activity, decrease of pathological waves and frequencies on the EEG, decline of the vascular tone and improvement of the blood content on the REG in addition to the shortening of the time required for the search for numbers according to Schulte's tables, a decrease of errors made during calculation, an increase of words and the family of words in the memorization and "associative" thinking tests. The data obtained may attest to the amelioration of cerebral function and hemodynamics because of the rehabilitation treatment.
