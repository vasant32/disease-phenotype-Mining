The state of microcirculation was studied by bulbar biomicroscopy in 18 healthy persons and 53 patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy before and after treatment with vasoactive drugs (xanthinol nicotinate, Cavinton, Sermion). It was found that the microcirculation changes depended on the stage of the disease. It was found that the above drugs produced a positive effect on the microcirculation, the values of which normalized by the end of the course of treatment, especially after their direct administration.
