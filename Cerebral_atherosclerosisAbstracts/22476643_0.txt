The aim of this paper is to explore whether the heterozygosity at the 9 CODIS short tandem repeats (STR) loci including D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317 and D7S820 is associated with the risk of atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (CI). The DNA samples were collected from patients with CI (n = 72) and people over the age of 90 years without CI (n = 59). Alleles of the STR loci were determined using the STR Profiler Plus PCR amplification kit. The relationship between the age of onset and heterozygosity was determined with the Cox regression method. A correlation between the age of onset and heterozygosity was observed for the D8S1179 locus (p < 0.05). It implied that regions in the vicinity of locus D8S1179 may harbor susceptibility genes for CI. The analysis of heterozygosity for particular loci as genetic markers using our new study design may be an efficient and reliable approach to estimate genetic predispositions.
