 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is an inflammatory marker associated with subsequent coronary events and neointimal hyperplasia after coronary artery stent placement. We sought to determine if elevated levels of hsCRP are associated with restenosis after placement of extra- and intracranial stents. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 73 consecutive patients at Michigan State University from July 2006 until June 2007 who underwent treatment with carotid artery stent placement or intracranial stent placement. Data were collected in regards to demographics, pre-procedural hsCRP, and LDL levels, and angiographic variables characterizing the lesion before and after treatment. A binary logistic regression model was constructed to determine independent predictors of restenosis. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients with a mean age of 69 +/- 11 years were studied. A total of 57 patients were treated with extracranial carotid stenting, 22 (38%) of whom were symptomatic, while 16 patients underwent intracranial stenting (all were symptomatic). There were 9 patients (4 intracranial stents [25%] and 5 carotid stents [8.8%]) who developed a restenosis of >50%. In binary logistic regression modeling, the following variables were found to be independently predictive of developing restenosis: smaller vessel diameter (OR .49, 95% CI .23-.98, P-value .046) and elevated hsCRP (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.29-6.66, P-value .018). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of pre-procedural hsCRP may be predictive of the development of neointimal hyperplasia in patients treated with extra- or intracranial stenting procedures. Future prospective multicenter studies will be required to confirm these findings.
