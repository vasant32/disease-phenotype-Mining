Recent reports of the risk of asymptomatic carotid stenosis have been compromised by flawed patient selection or the performance of a large number of carotid endarterectomies during follow-up. We report the natural history of a randomly selected group of asymptomatic patients (n = 188; 114 males and 74 females) with documented carotid artery disease who were prospectively followed without intervention for up to 8 years. Risk factors included ischaemic heart disease in 17%, diabetes in 10%, hypertension in 46% and 88% were smokers. The degree of internal carotid stenosis was classified by duplex scanning and a total of 259 vessels had evidence of atherosclerosis. Study end-points included TIA, CVA and death. At mean follow-up of 4 years 3% of the 96 patients with internal carotid artery stenosis of less than 50% had died and 2% suffered a stroke. Six per cent of patients with a stenosis of 50-79% had died and 4% and 2% had suffered a CVA and TIA, respectively. In the 59 patients with greater than 80% stenosis 7% had suffered a TIA and an additional 7% a CVA, while 2% had died. None of the patients suffering a stroke had an antecedent TIA. Though the incidence of ischaemic events is significantly higher in patients with greater than 80% stenosis the incidence of unheralded stroke remains low. We therefore continue to recommend a conservative approach to the management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.
