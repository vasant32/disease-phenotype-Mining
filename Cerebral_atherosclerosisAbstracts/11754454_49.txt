A thorough understanding of the relationship between local hemodynamics and plaque progression has been hindered by an inability to prospectively monitor these factors in vivo in humans. In this study a novel approach for noninvasively reconstructing artery wall thickness and local hemodynamics at the human carotid bifurcation is presented. Three-dimensional (3D) models of the lumen and wall boundaries, from which wall thickness can be measured, were reconstructed from black-blood magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Along with time-varying inlet/outlet flow rates measured via phase contrast (PC) MRI, the lumen boundary was used as input for computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation of the subject-specific flow patterns and wall shear stresses (WSSs). Results from a 59-year-old subject with early, asymptomatic carotid artery disease show good agreement between simulated and measured velocities, and demonstrate a correspondence between wall thickening and low and oscillating shear at the carotid bulb. High shear at the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) was also colocalized with higher WSS; however, a quantitative general relationship between WSS and wall thickness was not found. Similar results were obtained from a 23-year-old normal subject. These findings represent the first direct comparison of hemodynamic variables and wall thickness at the carotid bifurcation of human subjects. The noninvasive nature of this image-based modeling approach makes it ideal for carrying out future prospective studies of hemodynamics and plaque development or progression in otherwise healthy subjects.
