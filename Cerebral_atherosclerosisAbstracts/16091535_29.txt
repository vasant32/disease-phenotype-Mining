We evaluated the feasibility of angiographic CT (ACT) for visualizing metallic stents in three patients who underwent intracranial (n = 2) or extracranial (n = 1) stent placement to treat atherosclerotic lesions. ACT is a new technique that provides cross-sectional CT-like images based on rotational radiography performed with a rotating C-arm-mounted flat-panel detector. ACT allowed for the clear visualization of stents in both intracranial and extracranial arteries and was superior to conventional digital subtraction angiography and digital radiography in visualizing both the stent struts and their relationships to the arterial walls and aneurysmal lumen.
