The association of R219K and V825I polymorphisms of ABCA1 gene with cerebral infarction has been rarely reported. Here we wish to address this issue. A total of 476 subjects from Chinese Han ethnic population were investigated, including 152 control individuals and 324 patients with cerebral infarction. Genotyping of R219K and V825I were performed by PCR-RFLP analysis. Data were analyzed using a statistical package. The R219K genotype frequency distributions were significantly different between patients with atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (ACI) and control individuals, with fewer KK genotypes and more RR genotypes in ACI patients (chi(2)=9.89, P<0.01). The K allele is less frequent among ACI patients than in controls (chi(2)=9.16, P<0.005). A significant association of KK with decreased ACI risk was exhibited, especially in male patients, aged patients and individuals with hypertension. These results indicate that the K allele of R219K polymorphism is an independent protective factor against ACI. In addition, though there is no association of V825I with ACI, this polymorphism may have certain synergistic effect with hypertension in susceptibility to ACI.
