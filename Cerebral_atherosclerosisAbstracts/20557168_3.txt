 PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and angiographic outcomes of endovascular treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis between octogenarian and younger patients. METHODS: Data for 244 consecutive patients (173 men; mean age 61.6 years) who underwent angioplasty and/or stenting for intracranial atherosclerotic disease at 5 specialized centers were pooled. Baseline, 30-day, and follow-up clinical and angiographic information were collected. Rates of clinical and angiographic endpoints were compared between patients >or=80 years old versus those <80 years. RESULTS: Patients >or=80 years (n = 15) were more likely to be hypertensive (87% versus 69%) and have underlying coronary artery disease (73% versus 36%, p<0.05) compared to younger patients (n = 229). The rate of periprocedural stroke and/or death was 3-fold higher among patients aged >or=80 years compared with those <80 years (20% versus 7%, p = 0.11). No recurrent stroke or death (excluding periprocedural events) was observed during follow-up in the octogenarian group. In patients who had follow-up angiography, a similar rate of >or=50% restenosis was observed among patients aged >or=80 years and those aged <80 years (25% versus 29%, p>0.1). CONCLUSION: The 3-fold higher periprocedural death and/or stroke rate suggests cautious use of intracranial angioplasty and/or stent placement in octogenarians.
