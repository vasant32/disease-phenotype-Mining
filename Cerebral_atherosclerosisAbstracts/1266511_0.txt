The authors studied adrenalin and noradrenalin excretion with the diurnal urine and the state of hemocoagulation in 63 patients with transient disturbances of the brain circulation. A reliable increase of adrenalin excretion, a decrease of noradrenalin and an expressed activation of hemocoagulation were established. The extent of the functional state changes of the sympathetico-adrenal system varied according to etiology of brain circulation disturbances. A close relationship between indices of the sympathetico-adrenal system and the hemocoagulation process was found.
