The Evans blue dilution method and ultrasound dopplerography were used to study the effect of nicergolin on the systemic and cerebral hemodynamics in 31 patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy against the background of atherosclerotic lesions of the major head arteries. It was established that nicergolin reduces the arterial pressure, diminishes the minute blood volume, cardiac and stroke indices, increases the specific peripheral vascular resistance, the linear blood flow velocity prevailingly in the stenosed major head arteries, results in a regression of the subjective and objective neurological symptomatology. Considering the cardiodepressive effect of nicergolin, this agent is indicated in patients with the hyperkinetic type of the systemic hemodynamics.
