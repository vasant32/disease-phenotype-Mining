Genetic variants of tPA (PLAT) and PAI-1 genes have been suggested to be the risk factors for stroke. In the present case-control study we investigated the association of -7351C/T polymorphism (rs2020918) and I/D polymorphism of tPA gene and Insertion/deletion polymorphism (4G/5G) of PAI-1 gene with genetic predisposition to ischemic stroke. 516 stroke patients and 513, sex and age matched healthy controls were involved in the study. We did not find a significant association of tPA -7351C/T polymorphism and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism with stroke. However, in case of I/D polymorphism significant difference was observed in the genotypic distribution and allelic frequency between the stroke patients and healthy controls. DD genotype and D allele associated significantly with stroke (p=0.002 and <0.001 respectively). We also found significant association of I/D polymorphism with intracranial large artery atherosclerosis and stroke of undetermined etiology. Exploring the association between gene-gene interaction (26 combinations including the three variants) and stroke, we found that individuals with CC+4G4G+DD, CC+5G5G+ID, CT+4G5G+ID, CT+5G5G+II, CT+5G5G+ID and TT+4G5G+II had a significantly higher risk of stroke. The results of this study suggest that -7351C/T polymorphism of tPA and 4G/5G polymorphism of PAI-1 are not associated with stroke, while as DD genotype and D allele of tPA gene are important risk factors for ischemic stroke. Further we found that the subjects with different tPA and PAI genotype combinations displayed a significantly high risk for overall ischemic stroke suggesting that gene-gene interaction involving more variants may change the susceptibility of particular subjects to the disease.
