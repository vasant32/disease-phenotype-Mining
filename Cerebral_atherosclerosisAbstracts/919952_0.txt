On the basis of clinical (150 cases) and clinico-morphological (40 cases) studies of patients with chronic insufficiency of cerebral circulation due to hypertensive disease or atherosclerosis with symptomatical hypertension the following extrapyramidal disorders of a vascular genesis were distinguished: 1) extrapyramidal -- pyramidal; 2) extrapyramidal -- pseudobulbar; 3) extrapyramidal -- cerebellar; 4) extrapyramidal -- thalamic; 5) extrapyramidal -- spinal 6) the syndrome of arteriosclerotic muscular rigidity. It was demonstrated that these syndromes may appear not only in lesions of the striar arteries, but in stenosing atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries and involvement of the vessels of verterbobasillar system. Development of different syndromes depends upon the prevalence of disorders in a certain vascular basin, the characters and severity of the main disease.
