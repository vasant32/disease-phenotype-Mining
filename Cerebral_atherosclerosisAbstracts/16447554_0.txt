Forty-seven patients: group A--17 patients with acute ischemic atherothrombotic stroke and group B--30 patients with acute Q-formation myocardial infarction. The levels of dynamics and comparative clinical relevance of crioglobulinemia in patients of the both groups have been evaluated. Crioglobulines (CG) in the peripheral blood serum were determined at 1, 2, 3, 7th and 14th days after the disease development. On the 1st day, the elevated CG level similar in the both groups as well as similarity of crioglobulinemia dynamics in whole was observed. In the group A, but not in the group B, the CG level was directly correlated with disease severity (p<0,05). In the group B, there was a trend, which depended on the blood CG level on the 1st day of the disease and on the presence of previous stenocardia (p<0,1).
