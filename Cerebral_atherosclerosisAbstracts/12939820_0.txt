In our studies an attempt was undertaken to establish whether there is a relationship between total cholesterol and LDL fraction concentrations and LDL receptors expression on monocytes in various clinical types of atherosclerosis and in subjects without clinical manifestations of this disease before and after 40 years of age. The study included 77 subjects divided into 4 groups: I--after myocardial infarction, II--after cerebral ischaemic stroke, III--with obliterative atheromatosis of the lower limbs, and control group IV without clinical symptoms of atheromatosis: a) subjects below 40 years of age b) over 40 years of age. Receptor expression on monocytes was tested with LDL Receptor Test (Orpegen Pharma, Heidelberg, Germany) using flow fluorometry method (FAC Scan, Backton Dickinson, San Jose, USA). The value of LDL receptors expression was calculated based on the difference of mean fluorescence intensity of monocytes incubated in low-lipid (LPDS) and autologous sera. It has been demonstrated that particular types of atheromatosis vary in the value of total cholesterol and LDL fraction concentrations. The highest concentrations of these lipid fractions were observes in ischaemic heart disease and only in this group they correlated with the value of LDL receptors expression on monocytes. This observation suggests that various clinical types of atheromathosis may differ pathogenically and lesions in the vessels may be the consequence of cholesterol transport defect or of lipid molecule modification; they not necessarily depend on the value of absolute lipid concentration in blood.
