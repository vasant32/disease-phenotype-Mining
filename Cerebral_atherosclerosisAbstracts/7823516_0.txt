Immediate and late follow-up results of nonoperative and operative treatment of 244 patients with atherosclerotic dyscirculatory encephalopathy (ADE) were analyzed. The effectiveness of operative treatment is 1.9 times the non-operative one. Surgical correction of ADE of the I-II stages is mostly prognostically favourable. Operative intervention in patients with ADE of the III stage is justified if the operation risk is lower than the risk of disease progress. Indications for the operative treatment in patients with ADE caused by stenosing lesions of the main head arteries are elaborated.
