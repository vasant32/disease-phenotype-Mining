Glycogenosis type II (Pompe disease) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). The disease is autosomal recessive inherited and is clinically and genetically heterogenous. The authors describe a 30-year-old woman affected by late-onset Pompe disease with vascular affection resembling atherosclerotic angiopathy of the elderly. Genetic analysis revealed two novel mutations (Ala237Val and Gly293Arg) in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene in this patient.
