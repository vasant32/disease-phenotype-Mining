Patients with a chronic brain ischemia of stages I-II on the background of hypertension and/or cerebral atherosclerosis are characterized by energy insufficiency of the metabolism, as estimated by the activity of succinate dehydrogenase in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Within the framework of randomized comparative investigation of the efficiency of actovegin and mexidol in the complex therapy of a chronic brain ischemia, positive dynamics in reduction of the clinical semiology, restoration of cognitive processes in the brain, and reduction of the expression of subjective manifestations of the disease is established. On this background, the administration of mexidol led to restoration of the energy exchange due to substrate effects of the Krebs cycle intermediates present in its structure.
