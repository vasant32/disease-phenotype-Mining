Persistence of the hypoglossal artery is an unusual congenital abnormality of the carotid arterial system, and the simultaneous occurrence of atheromatous disease in the internal carotid artery and persistent hypoglossal artery is even more uncommon. Carotid surgery in this situation is challenging, and the surgeon must be aware of potential inherent pitfalls. A 74-year-old woman with asymptomatic stenosis of both internal carotid and hypoglossal arteries associated with occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery underwent successful revascularization. The anatomy of this unusual lesion and the surgical strategies, which included cranial nerve dissection and mandibular subluxation, are reviewed.
