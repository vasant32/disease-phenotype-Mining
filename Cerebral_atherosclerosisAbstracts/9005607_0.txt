NMR tomography (NMRT) of the brain and NMR angiography (NMRA) of the extra- and intracranial arteries were performed on the unit Magnetom 63 SP (1.5 T) Siemens in 13 healthy controls and 87 patients with cerebrovascular diseases initiated by arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis of major cerebral arteries. NMRA image of arterial impairment comprise curved extracranial arteries. NMRT picture of the brain was changed (extension of liquor spaces, small hyperintensive foci in the white matter) in mild and moderate hypertension. Frequency of these phenomena and their severity increase with growing severity of the disease reaching maximum in malignant hypertension. In atherosclerosis of the major cerebral arteries NMRT often detected strokes, for the most part ischemic. A direct relationship between the degree of arterial stenosis and incidence of the strokes was not found.
