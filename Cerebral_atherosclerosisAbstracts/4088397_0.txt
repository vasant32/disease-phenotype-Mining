The authors report four cases of carotid cavernous fistula at the C5 segment of the internal carotid artery following embolectomy by a 3F Fogarty Catheter. All patients were operated on a carotid bifurcation stenosis (pre-occlusive) and a thrombectomy with a 3F Fogarty Catheter was carried out in the same time in 3 patients and during re-operation in 1 patient who had post operative thrombosis. The carotid-cavernous fistula occurred the day after surgery in 2 cases, 1 week after in 1 case, and 2 months later in 1 case. Spontaneous recovery occurred in two patients (1 occlusion--1 re-stenosis), 1 patient died from controlateral carotid occlusion, and 1 patient was lost for investigation. There were no relationship between the number of "repeated passages" of the Fogarty Catheter and the interval time where the fistula occurred. However the location of fistula was constant. Overtension on the internal wall of the artery by the balloon could be advocated rather than a collateral torn of the intra cavernous internal carotid. Endoluminal treatment of various vascular lesion is increasingly used and iatrogenic problems as reported here should be kept in mind. Age and atheromatous lesion of carotid siphon appear to be the main risk factors.
