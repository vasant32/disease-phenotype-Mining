19 patients with severe stenoses or occlusions of the internal carotid artery showed spontaneous recanalization at follow-up. The cause of the stenotic process was spontaneous or traumatic dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, ergotism or arteriosclerotic disease. Total recanalization occurred in carotid artery dissections coinciding with the best clinical outcome. In fibromuscular dysplasia and arteriosclerotic process, recanalization was seldom found, incomplete, and the clinical course was less favourable.
