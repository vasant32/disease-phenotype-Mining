In an experimental study the diagnostic value of intra-operative ultrasonography in the detection of arterial intimal lesions was investigated. A human carotid artery was placed in a pulsatile circuit with a roller pump and tubes. Intimal lesions (1-5 mm) were created and ultrasonography and biplane arteriography were performed. The ultrasonograms and arteriograms obtained were interpreted by three observers, who were blind to the procedures performed and the results were compared to the macroscopic defects. The mean sensitivity between observers for ultrasonography was 84% with a specificity of 95.7%. For biplane arteriography the mean sensitivity was 42% with a specificity of 94.5%. The differences between ultrasonography and biplane arteriography were statistically significant (p less than 0.02). It is concluded from this is concluded from this in vitro study that ultrasonography provides more accurate information concerning intimal lesions of the arterial wall than biplane arteriography.
