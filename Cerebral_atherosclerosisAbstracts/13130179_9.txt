 BACKGROUND: Platelet activation is a key step in the progression of atherosclerosis. The CD40 ligand (CD40L) on platelets may be a critical factor to develop the acute vascular events from atheroma. METHODS: To determine the role of CD40L on platelets in atherosclerotic ischemic stroke, we serially measured the expressions of CD63, P-selectin and CD40L on platelets in patients with atherosclerotic ischemic stroke (n = 25) and compared them with those in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (n = 20) and in normal subjects (n = 24). RESULTS: The expressions of CD63 and P-selectin on platelets were significantly higher in patients with atherosclerotic ischemic stroke (n = 25) than in normal subjects (n = 24). The extents of surface expressions of CD63 and P-selectin on platelets showed no significant differences between atherosclerotic ischemic stroke and asymptomatic carotid stenosis. However, the CD40L expression on platelets was significantly higher in atherosclerotic ischemic stroke when compared to that in asymptomatic carotid stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: In our data, among the population with large artery atherosclerosis, the patients with symptomatic ischemic events showed a significantly elevated expression of CD40L on platelets compared to those without ischemic events. Therefore, the upregulation of CD40L on platelets may be a specific marker of platelet activation to provoke ischemic stroke from large artery atherosclerosis.
