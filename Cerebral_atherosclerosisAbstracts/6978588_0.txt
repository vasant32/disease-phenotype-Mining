Examinations of the changes in the parameters of the reaction of clotted blood morphological dissociation (CBMDR) occuring in the acutest period of ischemic cerebral stroke were carried out over time. Regular changes of those parameters were revealed, these changes depending on the disease gravity and time course. In graver forms and course of the ischemic stroke a diminution of the volume of the IIId blood-clotting fraction and a shortening of the time of its formation were observed. As the patients' state improved in the course of the conservative treatment given, the above parameters gradually approached those observed in the control group. On the contrary a deterioration of the patients' state led to a rapid diminution of the IIId fraction volume and shortening of the time of its formation. The changes of the CBMDR parameters allow one to judge about the gravity of ischemic cerebral stroke and the time course of the pathological process, as well as to assess the efficacy of the therapy given.
