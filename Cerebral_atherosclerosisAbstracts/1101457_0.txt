Cyclandelate, a vasodilator, was administered to 24 patients with dementia. The dementia in these patients was presumed to be due to cerebral ischemia caused by atherosclerosis in cerebral vessels after other possible causes were ruled out. In a double-blind, cross-over study, patients received 200 mg of cyclandelate four times daily for six weeks and a placebo for six weeks. Six psychological tests, which reflect various aspects of higher cortical ability, were used to evaluate the effect of cyclandelate on the dementia. Cyclandelate was found to be no more effective than placebo in improving higher cortical function in these demented patients.
