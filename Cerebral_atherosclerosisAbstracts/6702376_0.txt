In order to detect a high risk group for the stroke development as early as possible, a comparative retrospective study based on specially-designed forms was carried out. It involved 67 stroke-survivors and 83 patients with initial manifestations of compromized brain circulation and showed that the pre-stroke period in the patients studied had been characterized by few or no symptoms at all. A high risk group should include people with asymptomatic arterial hypertension (AH) or AH attended by cephalgia as well as individuals with rare paroxysmal conditions that developed after 40 years. The regularities ascertained may serve as the basis for the assessment of the possible risk of the stroke development during mass prophylactic screening.
