Single carotid intraplaque hemorrhage has been related to the occurrence of cerebrovascular ischemic symptoms. We were unable to reproduce these findings; therefore, our patient population was reinvestigated to ascertain the importance of repeated plaque hemorrhages and their possible relationship to the production of neurologic symptoms. Eighty-five consecutive patients underwent 95 carotid endarterectomies. Plaques were separated into three groups: those from patients with lateralizing symptoms, nonlateralizing symptoms, and no symptoms. All the plaques were inspected microscopically for evidence of hemorrhage, specifically, repeated hemorrhages. Repeated hemorrhages were found in 29 of 44 plaques (66%) in the lateralizing symptom group, 6 of 19 (32%) in the nonlateralizing symptom group, and 12 of 32 (37%) in the no symptom group. We conclude that repeated rather than single intraplaque hemorrhage is the critical factor related to the production of specific cerebrovascular ischemic symptoms.
