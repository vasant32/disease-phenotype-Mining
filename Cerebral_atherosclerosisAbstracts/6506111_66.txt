Highly elevated concentrations of homocysteine measured as homocysteine or cysteine-homocysteine mixed disulfide (MDS) are found in plasma and urine in subjects with inherited abnormalities of the methionine metabolism. These subjects have a high incidence of arteriosclerotic vascular complications during childhood. Homocysteine causes endothelial cell injury and cell detachment that initiates the development of arteriosclerosis. The present study demonstrates a significantly elevated mean plasma MDS concentration in 19 patients with arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease compared to 17 controls. Our findings suggest that moderate homocysteinemia might be a risk factor for arteriosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.
