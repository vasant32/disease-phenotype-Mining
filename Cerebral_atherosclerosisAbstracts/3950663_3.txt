Ophthalmological data were obtained in 40 patients presenting with lacunar stroke. The stroke was verified clinically as well as by computed tomography. Vision was tested and the visual field, intraocular pressure, retinal arteriovenous passage time, arm-retina time, and erythrocyte flow velocity in the conjunctival capillaries were all determined; ophthalmoscopy was also carried out. Microcirculatory parameters were obtained from 21 patients. Significant disturbances of the retinal arteriovenous passage time were observed, but there were no significant disturbances of the conjunctival erythrocyte flow velocity. The concurrently measured haemorheological parameters were all pathological with the exception of the haematocrit. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed arteriosclerotic alterations in 38 of 40 patients. These angiological and rheological findings confirm the importance of disturbed microcirculation in lacunar stroke.
