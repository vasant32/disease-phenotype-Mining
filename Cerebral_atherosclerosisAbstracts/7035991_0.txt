The reported investigations were carried out in a group of patients with evidence of cerebral circulatory disturbances aged from 43 to 72 years treated with Prodectin for 5-7 weeks. The dynamics of the clinical manifestations and REG curves were analysed before and after treatment. REG investigations were done using a II type rheograph with Fc-M leads. The basic parameters of the REG waves and reaction to nitroglycerin were evaluated. The results of REG were compared with the results of similar investigations in an age-matched control group. In nearly half the patients a tendency was observed for REG tracing normalization wit clinical improvement. Most frequently shortening of the ascending part of the REG wave was observed.
