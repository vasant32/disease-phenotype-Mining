The authors studied the blood kinin system in patients with transient impairments of the cerebral circulation (TICC) both in the presence of hypertonic crises (30 patients) and cerebral vascular atherosclerosis (30 patients) during a vascular episode on the 10th-15th day of treatment. During TICC, the patients showed a marked activation of the blood kinin system which was especially pronounced in hypertonic rises. The underlying disease had a significant impact on the time-course of kinin system activity. In patients with TICC associated with hypertonic crises, hypotensive treatment decreased kinin activity to a considerable degree whereas in cases of cerebral vascular atherosclerosis the treatment exerted no noticeable effect on the activity of kinins. The involvement of kinins in the processes of the compensation and pathogenesis in TICC is discussed. It is recommended that TICC associated with arterial hypertension be treated by sodium salicylate, whereas in TICC associated with atherosclerosis the administration of antikinin drugs is indicated (parmidin, prodectin).
