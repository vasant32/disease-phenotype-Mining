To study the influence of changes in the blood rheological indices and blood coagulation on development, progression and clinical course of restenosis and thrombosis, 62 patients (mean age 63.4 +/- 6.0 years), were followed up for 2-15 years after carotid endarterectomy. Above 50% (maximum 70%) restenosis was observed in 7% cases. No critical postoperative restinosis was observed. In 12% patients, restenosis was accompanied with carotid artery occlusion and hematocrit, with fibrinogen (FG) being significantly increased in the absence of fibrinolytic activity (FL) elevation, indicating hemorheological disorders and homeostasis activation in such patients. Long-term follow-up showed that viscosity blood characteristics were elevated but functional activity of platelets and FA in patients did not differ from those in healthy subjects. At the same time, FG was high and fibrinolysis index was lower than mean statistical value that indicated predominance of blood procoagulation activity.
