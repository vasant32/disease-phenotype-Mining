 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was to evaluate the retrobulbar hemodynamics in patients who have transient monocular blindness (TMB) without carotid stenosis. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients who have TMB without carotid stenosis were studied along with 59 age- and sex-matched controls. Color Doppler-imaging was used to study the retrobulbar hemodynamic by measuring the flow velocities (peak-systolic velocity, and end-diastolic velocity), vascular resistance indices (pulsatility index, and resistance index) in central retinal arteries, short posterior ciliary arteries, and ophthalmic arteries. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the attack frequency: group 1 (occasional TMB, 2 or fewer attacks, 26 patients) and group 2 (frequent TMB, 3 or more attacks, 33 patients). RESULTS: The risk factors for atherosclerosis were similar between the cases and controls. The means of end-diastolic velocity were significantly lower in central retinal arteries and ophthalmic arteries, and the pulsatility index and resistance index were significantly higher in all the 3 retrobulbar vessels in TMB patients than for the controls. The differences between patients and controls were greater for the group-2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have TMB without carotid stenosis had altered retrobulbar hemodynamics with a generalized increase in vascular resistance in the retrobulbar arteries. The role of venous hypertension as an etiology needs further study.
