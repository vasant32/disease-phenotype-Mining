From three men and seven women (mean age 70 years) with dementia of the Alzheimer-type (DAT), and from four men and six women (mean age 77 years) with multi-infarct dementia (MID) closed-eye EEGs were registered at 0800, 1200, 1600, and 2000 hours and recorded on tape for computer processing. The data of both groups were compared statistically and also compared with data of former investigations conducted with 10 healthy elderly volunteers and 10 patients who suffered from cerebral arteriosclerosis with serious disorder of sleep-walking rhythm (HA). Most pathological EEG deviations are found in the MID-patients, but there is no significant distinction compared to the DAT-patients, although three of the latter showed normal EEGs. Compared to the HA the EEGs of the MID-patients differed more from those of the healthy volunteers; however, the physiological circadian variations were not leveled as in the HA. Even in consideration of daytime dependent fluctuations of frequency-parameters, a clear-cut discrimination between DAT and MID by means of the EEG seems impossible.
