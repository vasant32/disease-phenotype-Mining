 OBJECTIVES: As a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF), LIGHT (TNFSF14) was recently found to be associated with platelets and released upon activation. Increased plasma levels of LIGHT have been reported in patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina. The aim of the study was to analyze plasma levels of LIGHT in acute ischemic atherosclerotic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The soluble LIGHT protein was analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in peripheral blood of patients with acute ischemic atherosclerotic stroke (n = 20), asymptomatic carotid stenosis (n = 19) and normal controls (n = 23). RESULTS: During the initial 24 h after onset, the stroke patients had an increased plasma LIGHT levels as compared with normal controls. Moreover, the plasma LIGHT levels of the stroke patients were correlated with blood platelet count (r = 0.6341, P = 0.0027). CONCLUSION: The elevated LIGHT levels may reflect a persistent chronic inflammatory response that may have been induced during early stages of the disease. We speculate that this derangement of LIGHT may be important for atherogenetic process of ischemic stroke.
