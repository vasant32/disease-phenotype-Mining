In six cases an attempt was made to relieve the tension on intracranial aneurysms by temporarily clamping the internal carotid artery in the neck, so as to increase the expansibility of the artery. This approach was based on the concept (or "A principle") that haemorrhage is caused by the aneurysm having to bear the full force of systolic pulse pressure when atherosclerosis prevents this pressure being taken up by the normally expansile arterial wall. Follow-up has been fairly short, but the preliminary findings in four of the six patients are encouraging. More attention must be paid in the future to the significance of atherosclerosis in the onset of bleeding from intracranial aneurysms and the incidence of postoperative problems. The argument that atherosclerosis permits the transmission of the systolic pulse directly to the aneurysm wall requires further investigation. The earlier pathological signs of atherosclerosis must receive greater attention, and post-mortem study of the walls of arteries in immediate juxtaposition to aneurysms with high-powered magnification is required.
