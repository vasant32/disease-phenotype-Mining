The paper deals with data of a clinico-electrophysiological study of 126 patients with atherosclerotic parkinsonism in its development. Three variants of the atherosclerotic parkinsonism course are demonstrated: a slowly progressive development with short-termed remissions of the major symptoms in extrapyramidal deficiency (28 patients); a slowly progressive development without remissions (59 patients) a rapidly progressive development (38 patients). The rate of atherosclerotic parkinsonism progressiveness directly depends upon the expressiveness of the atherosclerotic processes in all the organs and tissues, but mainly on the degree of the damage of the brain vessels and the heart. The increase of chronic cerebrovascular deficiency in patients with atherosclerotic parkinsonism lead to stable disturbances of metabolic processes not only at the extrapyramidal system level of the brain, but in the other areas.
