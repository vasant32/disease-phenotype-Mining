 OBJECTIVES: Low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are associated with atherosclerosis, and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) polymorphisms can change plasma levels of IGF-1 and may alter the function of the receptor. Whether there is any association of genetic variation in IGF-1R gene with ischemic stroke (IS) is presently unknown. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A 1:1 case-control study was conducted. The G --> A polymorphism of IGF-1R gene (rs2229765) were analyzed by TaqMan SNP genotyping technique in Chinese patients with IS (n = 309) and old subjects without IS (n = 309). RESULTS: The frequency of A allele in the patients and controls was 45.79% and 39.64%, respectively. The AA genotype distribution of IGF-1R gene was significantly higher in the patients (27.51%) than controls (18.23%; P = 0.022). Conditional logistic regression revealed that the AA genotype of IGF-1R was associated with IS (OR = 1.641, P = 0.022). After adjustment for smoking, alcohol drinking, history of hypertension, and body mass index, IGF-1R AA genotype was still significantly associated with an increased risk of IS (OR = 1.787, P = 0.029), compared with IGF-1R GG. CONCLUSIONS: The G --> A polymorphism in IGF-1R gene may affect the susceptibility to IS in Chinese population.
