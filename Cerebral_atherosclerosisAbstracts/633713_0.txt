Study of the blood platelet functional activity and intensity of hemolysis in 41 patients with transient disorders of cerebral circulation and comparison of the results with the corresponding indices in healthy individuals, in 40 patients with hypertensive disease free of crisis, and in 25 patients with cerebral atherosclerosis led to the conclusion that the character of cerebral stroke is already determined in the pre-stroke period. It depends on the functional state of the blood platelets in many respects. In patients with hypertensive disease in a period clear of crisis, for instance, there is a tendency towards hypoaggregation possible associated with the presence of latent hemolysis. Platelet hypofunction progresses in the period of hypertensive encephalopathy and still more during its transformation into hemorrhagic stroke. On the contrary, in patients with atherosclerosis but no symptoms of cerebral ischemia the adhesion-aggregation activity of the platelets does not differ essentially from that in healthy individuals. With the development of signs of ischemia of the brain, the platelet activity grows considerably, particularly when transient cerebral circulatory disorders transform into ischemic stroke.
