 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease that has been shown to cause various cardiovascular diseases and stroke. However, technologies to evaluate the volume of atherosclerotic plaque are limited. We present a method for determination of 3D plaque volume based on RA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3DRA images obtained from patients were used to evaluate the plaque. Six patients who were diagnosed with atherosclerotic lesions were included. The PR model developed for 3DRA was applied to analyze the geometry of the vessel and calculate the plaque volume. To validate the present method, we tested computer-generated phantoms with different degrees of stenosis. RESULTS: Application of PR to clinical cases allowed the estimation of plaque morphology and quantification of plaque volume. Technique validation showed that on average, PR can rebuild 92% of the plaque and provide satisfactory determination of plaque volume. CONCLUSIONS: A new approach to obtain plaque volume based on 3DRA is presented. The initial tests in 6 clinical cases and validation with different phantoms showed that this method is feasible. Further validation in a larger clinical series is required to assess the ultimate value of the present technique.
