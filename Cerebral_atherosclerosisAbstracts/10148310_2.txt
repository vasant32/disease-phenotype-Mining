Selective adsorption is a new method of treating Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Its therapeutic effects and its concomitant side effects were compared between plasma exchange and symptomatic treatment only. The clinical study of three groups of 10 Guillain-Barré patients, each matched for age and maximal disability, was analyzed.  Selective adsorption compared favorably with plasma exchange in shortening the time to first improvement and duration of in-hospital treatment. Side effects were similar in both groups.  Symptomatic arteriosclerosis should be considered a relative contraindication for selective adsorption.
