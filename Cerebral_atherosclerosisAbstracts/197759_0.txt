Using a wide complex of biochemical indices 166 patients with cerebral atherosclerosis were examined. It was shown that in this disease regardless of the period of acute stage a deficiency of the brain circulation of physicochemical changes of the serum proteins, lipoproteins and an oppression of the process of cholesterol exterfication precede quantitative accumulation of total cholesterol in the blood, beta-lipoproteins, a decrease of the lecethin level and changes of protein fractions. Heparin treatment along with improvement of the patients' clinical state, indices of general and brain hemodynamics decreased a free cholesterol level, increased the strength of cholesterol and apoprotein relationship and phosphorolipid content in the blood. In the author's opinion one of the leading causes of lipoprotein metabolic disorders in atherosclerosis can be a change of hormonal regulation of the activity in proteins enzymes of the organs and tissues, including the enzymes regulating an oxidation-reduction process in the organism. The significance of the studied indices for diagnosis and medical labour examination is considered.
