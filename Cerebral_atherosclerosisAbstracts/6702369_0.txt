Using a novel method of electrophoresis, patients with atherosclerotic and hypertonic dyscirculatory encephalopathy were examined for protein fractions of their blood serum. Various kinds of dysproteinemia and dyslipoproteinemia were recorded, with their manifestations being particularly pronounced in cerebral atherosclerosis with the syndrome of arterial hypertension. Clinical improvement following the therapy was usually accompanied by the normalization of the protein spectrum of blood serum. The results obtained may be utilized in the differential diagnosis and the evaluation of the therapy efficacy.
