Advancements in computer science and magnet design have resulted in the recent development of high resolution NMR imaging systems. Using our primate model we evaluated the ability of NMR scanning to detect early changes following middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Serial NMR scans documented progressive changes secondary to edema and swelling beginning ninety minutes after MCA occlusion. NMR was also able to readily demonstrate the area of cerebral infarct 10 days after a six hour episode of MCA occlusion. Soft tissue contrast and image resolution were superb. Correlation with pathologic sections was excellent.
