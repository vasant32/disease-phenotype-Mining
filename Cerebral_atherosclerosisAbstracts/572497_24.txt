The subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy of Binswanger is characterized clinically by hypertension, dementia, spasticity, syncope, and seizures. It is usually diagnosed pathologically by the finding in white matter of diffuse demyelination or foci of necrosis plus arteriosclerotic and hypertensive vasculopathy. We present a case in which the diagnosis was made on the basis of the clinical course and a computerized tomogram which demonstrated extensive white matter degeneration. Postmortem examination confirmed both the diagnosis and the extent of the degeneration as shown by CT scan.
