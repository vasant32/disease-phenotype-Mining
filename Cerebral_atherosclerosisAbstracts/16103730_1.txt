The black Caribbean population continues to grow in the US and little is known about stroke etiologies in that community. We examined stroke subtypes in 175 consecutive Haitian-born patients living in Miami, admitted for acute stroke. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed in 72%. Small vessel occlusion was the most frequent stroke subtype. There was a high prevalence of hypertension, medication noncompliance and intracranial atherosclerosis. Hypertension was the only cardiovascular risk factor significantly associated with small vessel infarction when compared with non-small vessel infarcts.
