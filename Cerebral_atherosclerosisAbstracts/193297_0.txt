Features peculiar to actual nutritional pattern (in family) of persons of advanced and old age in physiological ageing were studied. According to a fairly broad range of characteristics (cardio-vascular function, blood coagulation system, lipids metabolism parameters, body weight, general clinical diagnosis, etc.) their health status was determined. The alimentation of the examined is shown to be characterized by marked individual peculiarities. On the whole it conforms to the existing recommendations, although there is noted a certain deficiency of proteins, vitamins and mineral elements. Differences in the nutrition of males and females were established. The calorific value of the nutrition declines parallel with the increasing age. Its comparison with the health characteristics of the examined testifies to the presence of a close relationship between them. More favourable indices of the bioelectric activity of the heart, myocardial contractility, the trends in the lipids metabolism, body weight, the blood clotting activity were registered in persons with reduced calorific value of the alimentation.
