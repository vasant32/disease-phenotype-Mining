In a 40-year-old patient with a basal cell nevus syndrome an eruption of multiple basal cell epitheliomas had been induced by the manifestation of a seminoma. Combined incidence of basal cell nevus syndrome and seminoma hitherto has not been reported. Most of the eruptive epitheliomas occurred in the marginal areas of burn scars.
