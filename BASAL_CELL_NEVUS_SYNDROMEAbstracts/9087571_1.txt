The basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin syndrome) is characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas and diverse developmental defects. The gene responsible for this syndrome has been mapped previously to a 2 cM interval between D9S196 and D9S 180 at 9q22.3, and very recently mutations of a candidate gene in this region--the human homolog of the Drosophila patched gene have been identified. We report here on physical mapping studies integrating a contig of yeast artificial chromosomes and bacterial artificial chromosomes with a long-range map spanning approximately 5 Mb between the recombination-determined flanking markers. Six genes have been mapped to this interval.
