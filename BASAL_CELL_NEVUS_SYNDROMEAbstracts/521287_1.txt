In a 31-year-old patient with a basal cell nevus syndrome two basal cell epitheliomas occurred through exogenous factors. The tumors appeared within 18 years after BCG vaccination and 3 years after an intravenous drip respectively. In basal cell nevus syndrome this course of development of basal cell carcinomas is seldom described.
