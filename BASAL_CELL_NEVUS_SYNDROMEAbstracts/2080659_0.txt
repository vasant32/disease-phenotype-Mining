We report on a 27-year-old male patient suffering from multiple trichoepitheliomas, which first appeared on his face at the age of 15 and later spread to his upper extremities and back. Multiple trichoepitheliomas are benign tumors of the skin appendages with autosomally dominant heredity. Clinically, these lesions have to be differentiated from other adnexal tumors, adenoma sebaceum, as well as basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin-Goltz's disease).
