A single patient with basal cell nevus syndrome is presented. Prolonged application of 5% 5-fluorouracil and dinitrochlorobenzene was unsuccessful in inducing regression or clearing of his cutaneous lesions. Our results suggest that these therapies, at least for the nevoid-appearing lesions, may not be effective in the management of some patients with basal cell nevus syndrome.
