The literature concerning the association of the basal cell nevus syndrome with cleft lip and/or palate is surveyed. Seventeen cases, including two of our own patients, are discussed. Fifteen of the patients were males. Orofacial clefting appears to be an uncommon but definite symptom of the basal cell nevus syndrome. The male-female ratio of clefting in this syndrome is statistically not different from the ratio in the normal population.
