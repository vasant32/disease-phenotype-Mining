The survival of cells in density-inhibited, confluent cultures maintained at 37 degrees C was examined following exposure to 137Cs gamma rays at low dose rates (0.023 or 0.153 Gy/h) or to 60Co gamma rays at a single high dose rate (0.70-0.75 Gy/min). Cells from an ataxia telangiectasia (AT) homozygote showed no dose-rate effect, whereas a three- to fivefold increase in D0 was observed for all other cell strains exposed at low dose rates. The magnitude of the dose-rate effect did not differ significantly among cells from persons with hereditary retinoblastoma, basal cell nevus syndrome, or AT-heterozygote compared with normal cell strains, and was not related to the size of the shoulder (extrapolation number) of the survival curve. Furthermore, no differences in the capacity for the repair of potentially lethal damage during confluent holding were observed among these latter cell strains.
