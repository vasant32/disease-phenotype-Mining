Analysis of DNA fiber autoradiograms from basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS) skin fibroblasts has revealed for the first time a new defect in DNA replication earlier unknown in other chromosomal instability syndromes, that involves a significantly decreased rate of DNA-chain growth in unirradiated cells. Here we present evidence that the defect may be due to a marked reduction in number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons compared to that in normal cells, the rate of fork movement and the fusion of neighbouring units in the group remaining unchanged. Radioresistant DNA synthesis was observed in the BCNS cells. The exposure of cells derived from normal donor to gamma-rays at a dose of 5 Gy reduces the number of simultaneously operating groups of replicons to the level occurring in unirradiated BCNS cells, the rate of folk movement being unchanged in both cell types. However, the incidence of fusion between neighbouring units within the group is lower in the cells exposed to gamma-rays, due perhaps to a radiation-induced lesion in the group. Thus, ionizing radiation reduces the rate of DNA synthesis to the same level, however from different initial levels. Our data suggest that the phenomenon of radioresistant DNA synthesis may be explained by the presence of the initial defect in DNA replication in BCNS or any other chromosomal instability disorders.
