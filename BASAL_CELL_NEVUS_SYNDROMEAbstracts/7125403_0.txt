Authors report a representative case of basal cell nevus syndrome with great expressivity. The patient is a thirteen-year and ten-month-old girl. She shows the five major criteria of this disease: basal cell nevi, jaw cysts, skeletal abnormalities (bifid ribs, block vertebrae, rachischisis), ectopic calcifications (falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli, interclinoid ligaments) and pits on the palms of both hands. Moreover the patient had a right ovarian fibroma with a lot of calcified zones inside as well as several small fibromas of the left ovary. Giantism was associated with this syndrome. This finding has not been published before.
