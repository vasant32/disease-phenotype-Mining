A 20-year-old male with basal cell nevus syndrome (also known as Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome) was evaluated for snoring, daytime hypersomnolence, and poorly controlled hypertension. Nocturnal polysomnography confirmed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome with correction of symptoms with nasal bilevel positive pressure ventilation. Assessment for sleep disordered breathing is imperative in ongoing care for patients with this disorder.
