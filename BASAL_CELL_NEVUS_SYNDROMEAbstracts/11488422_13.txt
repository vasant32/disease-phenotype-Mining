We examined the immunohistochemical expressions of cell-cycle- and apoptosis-related factors to investigate the possible role of these factors in odontogenic keratocyst (OKC). Expression of cyclin D1 and p16 protein was detected in the basal and parabasal cells in lining epithelium of OKCs and was found more frequently in basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS)-associated OKCs than in primary or recurrent OKCs. Positivity for p21 protein was detected in basal to superficial cells, whereas that for p27 protein was detected in parabasal to superficial cells in lining epithelium of OKCs. DNA topoisomerase IIalpha reacted with nuclei in basal and parabasal cells of the lining epithelium of OKCs, and positive cells were observed in BCNS-associated OKCs significantly more frequently than in primary or recurrent OKCs. Expression of Fas in suprabasal to superficial cells and expression of Fas-L in basal and parabasal cells were detected in lining epithelium of OKCs. Immunoreactivity for caspase-3 was detected in basal to suprabasal or superficial cells in lining epithelium of OKCs. Single stranded (ss)DNA-positive nuclei were detected in superficial cells in lining epithelium of OKCs. Fas was more broadly distributed in BCNS-associated OKCs than in primary OKCs, and ssDNA-positive cells were observed in BCNS-associated OKCs significantly more frequently than in primary or recurrent OKCs. These results suggest that BCNS-associated OKCs might be a distinguishable entity from solitary OKCs.
