A patient with basal nervus syndrome was found to have an adenocarcinoma of the colon. This association, probably fortuitous, made it possible to study the effect of intravenous 5-fluorouracil on the cutaneous basal cell tumors. There was no reaction to this treatment. Subsequently, all visible basal cell tumors were satisfactorily eradicated with topical 5-fluorouracil.
