A 35-year-old male patient with hexadactyly on the right hand and both feet presented with multiple basal cell carcinomas of the skin. The results of further investigations led to the diagnosis of basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS). The basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin-Goltz syndrome) characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic cysts, skeletal abnormalities and associated neoplasms belongs to the group of genodermatoses. Reviewing the current literature we discuss aspects of the pathogenesis of the basal cell nevus syndrome as well as diagnosis criteria and treatment options.
