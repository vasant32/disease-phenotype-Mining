Report of ancillary finds in a known case of Holubar (multiple palmar basal cell epithelioma in basal cell nevus syndrome, 1970). Beside basalomata there was in several places formation of groups of sudoriparous glands. The epidermis surrounding these was thickened by normal or placode-like, papillomatous, basaloid differentiated tissue. In the fetus of albino rat there were discernible to the touch placodes for the sudoriparous glands, together with the thickening of the epidermis in basal cell nervus syndrome, are explained as phylogenetic hamartoma of phacomatotic etiology.
