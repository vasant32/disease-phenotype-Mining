The case of a child with basal cell nevus syndrome whose condition was successfully managed for 10 years with a combination of topical 5-fluorouracil and tretinoin is reported. The concurrent use of these two agents prevented the development of new tumors, inhibited the growth of existing tumors, and caused the regression of superficially invasive basal cell carcinomas.
