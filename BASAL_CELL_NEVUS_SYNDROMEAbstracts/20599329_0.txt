Gorlin syndrome also known as basal cell nevus syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant condition with variable expression. This syndrome is characterized by many anomalies of development and by the propensity of developing multiple neoplasms. We report a case of a 20-years-old French patient who has relapsing ovarian bilateral fibromas in condition of Gorlin syndrome. These fibromas are present in 25 % of Gorlin syndrome cases, which often are bilateral. The economic resection of these fibromas is recommended in spite of the risk of recurrence to preserve the fertility.
