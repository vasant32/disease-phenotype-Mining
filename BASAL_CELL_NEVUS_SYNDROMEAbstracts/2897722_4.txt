Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome (BCNS) is a rare autosomal-dominant inherited disorder associated with a marked hypersusceptibility to spontaneous and radiation-induced skin cancer. We examined the changes in cell survival, unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) and the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) induced by ultraviolet light (UVL) in confluent normal and BCNS fibroblasts. BCNS cells appeared slightly hypersensitive to the cytotoxic effects of UVL. The rate of UDS induced by UVL exposure in normal cell strains increased linearly following doses up to 30 J/m2, whereas in BCNS cells UDS became saturated at doses of 10 J/m2 showing no further increase with doses up to 30 J/m2. UDS activity persisted for longer periods after UVL exposure in BCNS as compared with normal cells. The dose-response relationship for UVL-induced SCE was similar in normal and BCNS fibroblasts. However, the frequencies of UVL-induced SCE declined to near background levels in normal cells following 12-24 hr of confluent holding prior to subculture whereas they remained elevated in BCNS cells with holding times up to 24 hr after UVL exposure. Overall, these results suggest that BCNS fibroblasts may have a diminished capacity for the repair of some type of DNA damage as compared with normal fibroblasts.
