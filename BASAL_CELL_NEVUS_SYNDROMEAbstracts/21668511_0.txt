 BACKGROUND: In basal cell nevus syndrome, basal cell carcinomas occur in early life. The treatment of basal cell carcinomas requires surgical excisions and may lead to unaesthetic scars. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a validated treatment of skin cancers, with good cosmetic outcomes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate patient's satisfaction, cosmetic outcome and number of surgical excisions before and after PDT, in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome treated with PDT. METHODS: A cross-sectional evaluation of all patients with basal cell nevus syndrome, treated with PDT for basal cell carcinomas. A questionnaire evaluated satisfaction, cosmetic outcomes for surgery and PDT. The number of surgeries before and after PDT was noted and efficacy was evaluated. RESULTS: Seven patients were evaluated; 85% of patients were satisfied with PDT vs. 55% for surgery. The average visual analogue score for the cosmetic result was 8.42/10 for PDT vs. 6.3/10 for surgery. The mean number of surgical excisions was 4.4 during the 6 months before the first session of PDT and 0.57 after. CONCLUSION: Methylaminolevulinate-photodynamic therapy seems an interesting option for the treatment of basal cell carcinomas in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome.
