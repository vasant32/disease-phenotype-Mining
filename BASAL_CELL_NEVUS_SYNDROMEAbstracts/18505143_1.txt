Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common nonmelanoma skin cancer in humans, and is the most common malignant neoplasm among adults in the US. The peak incidence occurs in the seventh decade of life. Childhood onset of BCC is rare and usually associated with genetic disorders such as basal cell nevus syndrome, Bazex syndrome, albinism, and xeroderma pigmentosum or due to radiation therapy. Idiopathic childhood onset is less common. A girl with idiopathic onset of BCC who was treated with Mohs micrographic surgery is reported. A computerized review of the literature was performed. A total of 108 children including this patient were reported with idiopathic de novo BCC. Most of the tumors were nodular and located on the head, the same as in adults. Basal cell carcinoma in children is probably the result of genetic background and intense ultraviolet radiation exposure. The preferred treatment is excision with the Mohs micrographic technique.
