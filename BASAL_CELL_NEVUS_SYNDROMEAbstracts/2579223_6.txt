Sixteen cases of odontogenic keratocyst are reported. Two of the patients had basal cell nevus syndrome. The provisional diagnosis in most of the 16 cases was other than odontogenic keratocyst, and the presenting symptoms were usually swelling, pain, and sinus tract formation. The treatment varied from simple enucleation to marsupialization, homogenous bone grafting, and iliac bone grafting. There was a 25% recurrence rate, mostly associated with treatment by enucleation, cysts that were parakeratinized or difficulty in removing the lesion.
