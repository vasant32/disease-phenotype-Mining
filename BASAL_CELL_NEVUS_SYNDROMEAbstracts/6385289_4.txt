A 12-year-old girl with abdominal pain and occasional dark vaginal discharge was found upon abdominal x-ray examination to have amorphous pelvic calcification. Calcification can occur in ovarian fibromas and should be considered as a cause of amorphous pelvic calcification in female patients. When bilateral, calcified, and nodular, the possibility of basal cell nevus syndrome is suggested.
