An 11-year-old boy with multiple dentigerous cysts in the maxilla and mandible is described. Other findings seen in the face, plantar skin, skeletal system and oral cavity indicated the lesions to be due to the basal cell nevus syndrome. This was further confirmed by the presence of similar abnormalities in his father and brother.
