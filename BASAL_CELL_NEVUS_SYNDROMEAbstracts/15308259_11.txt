The Patched (PTC) gene is responsible for basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS) accompanied by multiple odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs), and its product plays a role in the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway involving smoothened (SMO) and GLI-1. To clarify the role of SHH signaling in OKCs, the expression of SHH, PTC, SMO, and GLI-1 and mutations of PTC were examined in 18 sporadic, 4 BCNS-associated OKCs and 7 control gingivae. SHH, PTC, SMO, and GLI-1 were detected in all OKC and gingiva samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunoreactivity for SHH and GLI-1 was markedly higher in epithelial components than in subepithelial cells, while immunoreactivity for PTC and SMO was similar in epithelial components and subepithelial cells in OKCs. The positive rate of PTC and SMO expression in subepithelial cells of OKCs was significantly higher than that in gingivae. The positive rate of GLI-1 expression in subepithelial cells of BCNS-associated OKCs was significantly higher than that in primary OKCs. These results suggest that the SHH signaling might be involved in the pathophysiologic nature of OKCs. While mutations of the PTC gene could not be detected in 4 BCNS-associated OKCs by direct DNA sequencing, 3 of 5 primary and 4 of 4 recurrent OKCs had several mutations of this gene. These results suggest that PTC mutations are probably related not only to BCNS-associated OKCs but also to sporadic OKCs.
