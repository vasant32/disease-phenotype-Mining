 BACKGROUND: Basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS) is an inherited condition marked by multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) associated with several other abnormalities. Various treatment modalities have been used to eradicate these tumors. However, recurrences and scarring limit their use. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the treatment of multiple BCCs associated with BCNS. METHODS: We describe three cases of BCNS in which multiple BCCs were effectively treated with ultrapulse CO2 laser. Postoperative Mohs micrographic surgical sections (thin sections looking for residual tumor) verified complete histologic clearance of the tumors. RESULTS: All three patients were effectively treated with ultrapulse CO2 laser. Minimal scarring was noted at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Ultrapulse CO2 laser can be used to effectively treat small BCCs in low-risk areas associated with BCNS with minimal posttreatment scarring.
