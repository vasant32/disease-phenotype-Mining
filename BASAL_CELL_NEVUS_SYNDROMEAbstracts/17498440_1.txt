Basal cell nevus syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, along with numerous other documented clinical features. Acrochordons (or skin tags) are common benign neoplasms that are appropriately left untreated in most patients. We describe two patients with known BCNS who were found to have multiple BCCs that clinically resembled acrochordons. Our findings support the biopsy of acrochordon-like growths in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome to rule out basal cell carcinoma.
