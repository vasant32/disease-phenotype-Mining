A 58-year-old man with basal cell nevus syndrome had variously sized basal cell epitheliomas (BCEs), mostly of the superficial type, on his chest, back, and lumbar areas. BCEs on the lumbar area were treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream which was applied daily under occlusive dressings (ODT). Complete erosion occurred in the center, but not at the periphery of the lesions. In the latter regions, BCE remained. Then cryosurgery (cryo) followed by topical 5-FU (cryo + 5-FU) was tried to treat the peripheral, non-eroded lesions; this caused complete erosions. Biopsy specimens obtained 6 months after epithelization did not show any evidence of recurrence. We also tried either cryo alone or cryo + 5-FU on the chest lesions, and either 5-FU alone or cryo + 5-FU on the abdominal lesions. Cryo alone or 5-FU alone could not clear BCE, but cryo + 5-FU could. These results suggest that the cryo + 5-FU was the most effective of these therapies.
