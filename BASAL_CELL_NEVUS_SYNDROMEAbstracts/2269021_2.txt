We report a case of linear basal cell nervus occurring on the thigh of a forty-five-year-old woman. In this lesion, the characteristic comedones were absent. Linear basal cell nevus is a rare, benign condition that must be differentiated from both basal cell nevus syndrome and linear basal cell carcinoma, either of which can be locally aggressive.
