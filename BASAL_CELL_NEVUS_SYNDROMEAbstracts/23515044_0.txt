 BACKGROUND: Generally basal cell carcinoma can be simply and curatively treated. However, large and long-standing tumours can be locally very destructive and in rare cases even metastasize. Hedgehog pathway inhibitors such as vismodegib constitute a new and promising therapy for metastatic or locally advanced basal cell carcinoma. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a patient with metastasized basal cell carcinoma and basal cell nevus syndrome who, in the context of a study, was successfully treated with vismodegib. The main undesirable effects in our patient were muscle cramps, loss of taste, nausea and hair loss. CONCLUSION: Basal cell carcinoma is potentially a locally destructive skin tumour that only very rarely metastasizes. Hedgehog pathway inhibitors such as vismodegib can be administered in a selected group of patients with basal cell carcinoma.
