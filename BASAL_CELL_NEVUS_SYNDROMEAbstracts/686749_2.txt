An 80-year-old black man had multiple basal cell epitheliomas (BCEs), palmar pits, and mandibular cysts. This patient is unusual, not only because of multiple BCEs, but also becuase they developed when the patient was at age 77. Only three other black patients with multiple BCEs in association with basal cell nevus syndrome have been reported previously.
