Thirteen young adults (ages 21 to 35 years) with periocular basal cell carcinoma were identified out of 409 patients of all ages with basal cell carcinoma (3.2%). Factors related to patient and tumor characteristics were analyzed. Two groups of patients were identified. Most of the patients tended to be of light complexion and eye coloring without a family history of basal cell carcinoma. A second group of patients with basal cell nevus syndrome was identified. The tumors generally were single small lesions, but not nodular, usually being morpheaform in tissue structure. The tumors were present for an average of 4.3 years before diagnosis. The area of excision was 5.4 times the clinically measured size.
