Multiple basal cell epitheliomas developed in two psoriatic patients during treatment with orally administered 8-methoxypsoralen and long-wave ultraviolet radiation (PUVA). Twenty-two basal cell epitheliomas (BCEs) were seen in the two patients, 80% occurring in non-sun-exposed areas. Since neither patient had any historical or clinical evidence of arsenic intake or the basal cell nevus syndrome, PUVA therapy may have been of pathogenetic responsibility for the development of these lesions.
