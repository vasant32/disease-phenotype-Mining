Several years ago the therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of inherited skin disorders were rather restricted; recently new possibilities have been developed and successfully applied. The author discusses the indications for a surgical procedure in basal cell nevus syndrome and the satisfying results revealed by dermabrasion in sebaceous adenoma of Pringle. The use of a low phenylalanine and tyrosine diet in case of palmoplantar keratosis with tyrosinemia is of theoretical as well as practical interest. However, a most striking therapeutic success is obtained by the treatment with drugs. The substitution of zinc in acrodermatitis enteropathica is very effective and not expensive! The positive effect of phenytoin in epidermolysis bullosa cicatricans is based on the partial inhibition of collagenase activity by this drug. Finally the author discusses the advantages of a treatment with retinoids in different hereditary keratinization disorders.
