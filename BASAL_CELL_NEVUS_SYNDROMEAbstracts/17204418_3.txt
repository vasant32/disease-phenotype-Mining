A connection between vitamin D deficiency and severe health problems including various types of cancer has been demonstrated. We have shown that patients that have to protect themselves against solar UV radiation for medical reasons, including patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS), lupus erythematodes (LE) or transplant recipients, are at risk to develop vitamin D deficiency. We conclude that 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels as a measure of vitamin D status have to be analyzed in patients that have to protect themselves against solar UV radiation for medical reasons. Suboptimal vitamin D status has to be substituted (e.g. via oral treatment) to protect against serious vitamin D deficiency-related health problems without increasing the risk to develop solar UV-induced skin cancer. Our finding that protection against solar UV radiation causes vitamin D deficiency underlines the need for re-defining dermatological recommendations for solar UV protection in skin cancer prevention programs.
