Cryotherapy was an effective modality in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma in the eyelid and periorbital area and cured 93% of the 29 lesions in 25 patients. This method was especially advantageous in patients with blood clotting disorders; those with medical contraindications to, or who refused, classical surgery; patients who had prior radiation or surgery; patients with the basal cell nevus syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosa; and in patients with medial canthal tumors. Experimental cryotherapy in the albino rabbit showed their lacrimal system is not adversely affected by freezing in the temperature range required for tumor death.
