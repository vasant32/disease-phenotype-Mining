The odontogenic keratocyst is a keratinizing squamous epithelium-lined cyst that occurs in the mandible and maxilla. In 5% to 10% of patients the keratocysts may be a manifestation of the basal cell nevus syndrome. The recurrence rate after surgical therapy for odontogenic keratocysts varies from 10% to 63%.
