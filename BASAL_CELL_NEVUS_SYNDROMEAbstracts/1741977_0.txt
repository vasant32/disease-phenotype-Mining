In this report we present a three-generation family in which five members present the basal cell nevus syndrome. In three of them a Noonan phenotype was present. The basal cell nervus syndrome is another example of a neural crest dysplasia associated with a Noonan-like phenotype. This observation supports the theory that the autosomal dominant mutation causing the neural crest dysplasia may lead to a Noonan-like phenotype.
