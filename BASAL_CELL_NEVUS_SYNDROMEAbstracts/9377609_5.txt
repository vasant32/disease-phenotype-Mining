A 26-year-old man with basal cell nevus syndrome presented to the Rocky Mountain Cancer Center (Denver, Colorado) for treatment of several basal cell carcinomas with photodynamic therapy using tin ethyl etiopurpurin (SnET2). The patient was of northern European descent, had type I skin (always burns, never tans), and had a 10-year history of multifocal basal cell carcinomas. The patient had a family history of Gorlin's syndrome (basal cell nevus syndrome); the syndrome had been diagnosed in this patient in 1985. The patient was enrolled in a Phase I/II clinical trial. He was given 1.2 mg/kg (94 mg total) of SnET2 via intravenous infusion; he returned to the clinic the following day for red light application. Thirteen lesions, in 12 treatment fields, were illuminated with light totaling 200 J/cm2 at a fluence of 150 mW/cm2. At the 3-month follow-up examination, all tumors were graded as having a complete response by modified AIDS Clinical Trial Guidelines oncologic standards. No evidence of recurrence has been noted during the 6-month follow-up period.
