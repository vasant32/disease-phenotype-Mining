The odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is a jaw cyst with a proclivity for local invasion and recurrence. This 20-year retrospective study was conducted to evaluate methods of treatment and recurrence rates. Forty-nine patients were identified with an average age at presentation of 39.5 years. The molar region of either the mandible or maxilla was the principal primary location; the maxillary antrum was also a common site. The majority of cysts were unilocular and associated with adjacent dentition. Initial therapy was typically enucleation with or without extraction of associated teeth; seven cases of recurrent or second primary odontogenic keratocysts required more extensive surgery. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 15 years with an average duration of 4.3 years. The overall recurrence rate was 35%, and the average time to recurrence 4 years. A recurrence rate of 60% was documented for patients with basal cell nevus syndrome or a family history thereof. Long-term follow-up is necessary following initial OKC treatment. The high rate of recurrence in patients with documented or suspected basal cell nevus syndrome suggests the need for more aggressive initial surgical management in this selected patient population.
