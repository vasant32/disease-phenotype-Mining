The expression of blood group antigens A and B has been studied in 8 ameloblastomas, 16 odontogenic keratocysts from patients with basal cell nevus syndrome, 11 odontogenic keratocysts from patients without the syndrome, and 12 non-keratinizing odontogenic cysts, using a double layer immunofluorescence staining technique. The amount of antigen in the lesions was compared with the content of antigen in normal buccal mucosa from each patient. All ameloblastomas reacted negatively, three cysts from the patients with the basal cell nevus syndrome reacted negatively, and the odontogenic keratocysts from patients without the syndrome as well as the non-keratinizing odontogenic cysts all gave a positive reaction.
