The clinical, genetic, radiological, dental and dermatological aspects of 3 patients with the autosomal dominant basal cell naevus syndrome are reported. An analysis of the phenotypic features of 72 cases described in the literature is presented and compared with a previous analysis. Ash leaf hypopigmentation similar to that found in tuberous sclerosis represents a unique finding in this syndrome. Other similarities to the phacomatoses are discussed. We were able to support a previous report that patients with the basal cell naevus syndrome have a normal end-organ response to parathormone stimulation, and that it is most probably not related to pseudohypoparathyroidism, as earlier reports suggested.
