BACKGROUND: Imiquimod 5% cream has been used effectively to treat superficial basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness, tolerability, and desirability of imiquimod 5% cream in treating superficial non-facial basal cell carcinomas in a patient with basal cell nevus syndrome. METHODS: Three biopsy-proven nonfacial BCCs were treated for 18 weeks with once daily application of 5% imiquimod cream. The lesions were then removed to search histologically for residual tumor. RESULTS: The two adequately treated tumors revealed no residual BCC upon removal. Our patient reported that he tolerated the treatment but he would not desire this treatment again based on the length of treatment time and the degree of local inflammation at the treatment sites. CONCLUSION: Imiquimod 5% cream appears to be effective in eradicating superficial nonfacial BCCs. The degree of local inflammatory response may affect the patients' tolerability of treatment and therefore patient compliance.
