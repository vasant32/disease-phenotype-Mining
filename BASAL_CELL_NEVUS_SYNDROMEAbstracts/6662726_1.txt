Clinical, histopathological, electron-microscopical and cytophotometrical features of a case of linear unilateral basal cell nevus are reported. Several publications exist on basaliomas originating in a nevus verrucosus or nevus comedonicus. Our case, however, is regarded as an abortive form of the basal cell nevus syndrome due to somatic mutation. Only some few comparable cases are documented in the literature.
