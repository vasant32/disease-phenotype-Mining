Dentigerous cysts are benign odontogenic cysts that are associated with the crowns of permanent teeth. They are usually single in occurrence and located in the mandible. Multiple cysts are reported in patients with conditions such as mucopolysaccharidosis and basal cell nevus syndrome. We present the radiologic findings of bilateral impacted maxillary cuspids with dentigerous cysts displacing the maxillary sinuses in a nonsyndromic patient, a condition that, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported.
