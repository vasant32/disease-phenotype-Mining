By means of an investigation on 7 patients from 3 families views are expressed on the problems of the basal cell-naevus-syndrome. The typical clinical signs appear preferentially and as first-symptoms in the jaw-bone as solitary and later developing multiple cysts. Because these first symptoms of the syndrome cause secondary, dentitio tarda (belated dentition) and displacement of the teeth, the dentist or the maxillo-facial-surgeon has a special responsibility for early diagnosis of this disease. Reference is made to the necessity of interdisciplinary cooperation and the ambulatory-care of the patients in the sense of a family registration and observation.
