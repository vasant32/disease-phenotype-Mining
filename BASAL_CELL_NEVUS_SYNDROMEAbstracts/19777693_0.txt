Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most commonly occurring malignancies in the United States, with over 1 million cases annually. Several subsets of patients within the general population are particularly susceptible to the development of basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. These groups include patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, basal cell nevus syndrome, epidermodysplasia verruciformis, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as organ transplant recipients. Organ transplant recipients are the largest and best characterized of these subsets of patients. Review of the available data regarding the epidemiology, etiology, and clinical features of NMSC in organ transplant patients provides insight into the care of other high-risk patients.
