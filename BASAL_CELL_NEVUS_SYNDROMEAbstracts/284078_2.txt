A 37 year old man with a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a history of heavy alcohol use presented with bilateral palmar pits. Similar lesions were noted in several family members, some of whom had limited use of the hands. Although the patient was referred for evaluation of the palmar pits of the basal cell nevus syndrome, close evaluation revealed the diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease.
