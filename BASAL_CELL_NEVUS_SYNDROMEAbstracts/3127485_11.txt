The aim of the study was to investigate the recurrence rate of keratocysts based on a material with a follow-up of at least 5 years, and to evaluate the relationship between different features of these cysts and their recurrence. It was found that of 75 keratocysts with follow-up times ranging from 5 to 17 years (mean 8.3), 32 (43%) recurred. The cumulative recurrence rate of the 67 annually examined cysts increased from 3% after the 1st year following the operation to 37% after the 3rd year. Thereafter, no new recurrences were noted. Recurrence of keratocysts in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome occurred more frequently than that of patients without the syndrome. Keratocysts enucleated in one piece recurred significantly less often than cysts enucleated in several pieces. The recurrence rate of keratocysts with a clinically observable infection, with fistula or with a perforated bony wall was higher than that of keratocysts without these features. Recurrence was also found more frequently in cysts with multilocular radiographic appearance than in unilocular cysts. The size or the location of the keratocysts did not have an influence on the recurrence rate.
