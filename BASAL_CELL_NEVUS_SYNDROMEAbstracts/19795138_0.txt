 INTRODUCTION: Basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS), also known as Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, comprises five main pathological features: nevoid basal cell carcinomas, keratocystic odontogenic tumors, congenital skeletal anomalies, calcification of the falx cerebri, and point skin depressions on the palms and/or soles. The disease exhibits a dominant autosomal hereditary trait, with implication of the human homologue of the Drosophila segment polarity Patched (PTCH) gene. BCNS is diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiological criteria and can be confirmed by genetic study. The patient prognosis is very good, with normal life expectancy in most cases. METHODS: The present study reports two cases of BCNS with the presence of maxillo-mandibular keratocystic odontogenic tumors. RESULTS: One case was diagnosed according to clinical criteria, while the other required genetic confirmation that revealed a germ line mutation in exon 17 (c.2868delC), not previously described in the databases, which was considered to be responsible for the disease.
