 BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to examine abnormalities in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and related risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Between September 2003 and June 2010, the ABI was determined in 3924 outpatients attending the Diabetes Center of the People's Liberation Army 306th Hospital. In addition, demographic and laboratory data were collected. The risk factors for an abnormal ABI were determined using univariate and stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The ABI was normal (0.91-1.3) in 93.1% of patients, low (<0.9) in 5.2%, and high (>1.3) in 1.7%. The prevalence of abnormal lower ABI was greater in elderly (â‰¥ 65 years) patients (12.2%) than in younger (< 65 years) patients (3.6%). Using normal ABI as the reference, low ABI in younger patients was found to be independently associated with HbA1c, the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and cerebrovascular disease. A low ABI in elderly patients was found to be independently associated with age, smoking, HbA1c, uric acid, total cholesterol, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy and cerebrovascular disease. A high ABI in younger patients was associated with being male. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of an abnormal ABI was high in patients with type 2 diabetes, especially elderly patients. Early identification and intensive treatment are needed to improve the quality of life and overall prognosis of patients with type 2 diabetes.
