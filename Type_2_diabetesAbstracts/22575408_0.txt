There has been a significant increase in the prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the past decade. The International Diabetes Foundation reported that there will be more than a half-billion people with diabetes by 2030, largely in emerging economies. Improved glucose control reduces microvascular and macrovascular complications and can be accomplished with intensive diabetes management. Continuous glucose monitors allow further improvement. The best way to emulate normal physiology is the development of an artificial pancreas. Early versions of closed-loop technology may be available in the United States in the next 3 to 5 years.
