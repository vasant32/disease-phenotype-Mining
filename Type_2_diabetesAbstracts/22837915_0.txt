 AIMS: The aim was to assess the dietary pattern during Ramadan season among type 2 diabetic Muslim subjects who underwent fasting and intensive dietary counseling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted among 70 Muslim subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who undertook fasting during Ramadan and was part of a randomized control trial using pioglitazone published previously. All subjects were subjected to a dietary assessment and counseling at three stages, i.e., initiation of the study, mid-Ramadan and post-Ramadan, by a trained dietician. Dietary assessment was done by the 24-hour dietary recall method and the food frequency questionnaire. Diabetic diet sheets were dispensed to subjects based on their body mass index (BMI), daily activity, and needs. RESULTS: The mean caloric intake between pre-Ramadan (before fasting) and mid-Ramadan (15 days after fasting) were 1506.80 kcal and 1614.29 (P = 0.001) respectively. The distribution of active components pre and during Ramadan were: carbohydrates (g) 260.76 and 265.35 g (P = 0.001), proteins (g) 43.64 and 46.19 (P = 0.001) and fat (g) was 32.88 and 44.16 (P = 0.0001) respectively. The percentage of energy from dietary carbohydrate prior to fasting (64.11 ± 6.73) and during fasting (68.41 ± 4.41) remained almost unchanged but statistically significant when compared at different intervals before and during fasting. Fat intake increased significantly during fasting (P = < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary composition in a type 2 diabetic Muslim population who undertook fasting during Ramadan showed a mean increase in consumption of all components of diet during the period of fasting. Nutritional compliance during such a time seems to be difficult and warrants repeated counseling and regular follow-up to achieve targets.
