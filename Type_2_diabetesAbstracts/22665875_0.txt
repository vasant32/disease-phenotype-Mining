A 36-year-old housewife, previously diagnosed with Sheehan's syndrome on glucocorticoid and thyroxine replacement therapy, presented with unprovoked diabetic ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis was corrected with intravenous fluids and insulin therapy. Further evaluation was suggestive of type 2 diabetes mellitus. On follow-up, she experienced repeated episodes of hypoglycaemia and insulin was tapered and stopped. Adequate glycaemic control was maintained with metformin monotherapy.
