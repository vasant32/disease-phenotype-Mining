Objective. Research on how adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) understand and use social support is limited. Therefore, we explored how adolescents with T2DM experience and perceive social support. Methods. Adolescents with T2DM were interviewed, and data were qualitatively analyzed using Consensual Qualitative Research methodology. Results. Four themes emerged: support for nondiabetes and diabetes-specific behaviors, feelings of belonging, and disclosure. All participants expressed emotional and self-care-specific support. For some, disclosure and a sense of belonging with others who had diabetes often led to support elicitation. Participants also expressed a fear of disclosing their diabetes to others. Discussion. Adolescents with T2DM value tangible and emotional support for behaviors both related and not related to diabetes. Fear of disclosure was a typical experience with disclosure often limited to close friends and family. Recommendations for health professionals to assist adolescents in promoting appropriate disclosure and means of requesting support are discussed.
