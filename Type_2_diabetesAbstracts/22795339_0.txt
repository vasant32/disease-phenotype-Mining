 PURPOSE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association between SLC2A1 26177A/G polymorphism and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Malaysian patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from 211 Malaysian type 2 diabetic patients (100 without retinopathy [DNR], 111 with retinopathy) and 165 healthy controls. A high resolution melting assay developed in this study was used to detect SLC2A1 26177A/G polymorphism followed by statistical analysis. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in 26177G minor allele frequency between healthy controls (19.7 %) and total patient group (26.1 %) (p<0.05, Odd ratio=1.437, 95% Confidence interval=1.015-2.035) as well as between healthy controls (19.7 %) and DNR patients (27.5%) (p<0.05, Odd ratio=1.546, 95% Confidence interval=1.024-2.336) was shown in this study. However, when compared between DR and DNR patients, there was no significant difference (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study which shows that SLC2A1 26177G allele is associated with type 2 diabetes in Malaysian population but not with DR.
