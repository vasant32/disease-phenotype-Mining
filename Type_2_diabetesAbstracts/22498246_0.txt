Type 2 diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder characterised by varying degrees of impairment in insulin secretion and resistance to the action of insulin. Considerable progress has been made recently in understanding the genetic determinants of diabetes. A logical next step is to describe how these variants relate to the underlying pathophysiological processes that lead to diabetes as this may provide insights into pathways to disease. These quantitative traits are, of course, of direct interest in themselves and a growing literature is now emerging on the genetic determinants of insulin secretion and insulin resistance. This review article focuses on describing the complex associations between type 2 diabetes risk variants and quantitative glycaemic traits and the relationship between variants initially discovered in association studies of these traits and risk of type 2 diabetes.
