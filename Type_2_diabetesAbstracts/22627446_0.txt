Klebsiella is an opportunistic pathogen that is known to cause septicemia, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, hepatobiliary tract infections, and soft tissue infections in patients who have severe underlying diseases or are under immunosuppression. Most Klebsiella species found are Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca is rarely cultured in humans. We report a case of a 48-year-old man presenting with a soft fluctuating mass on his forehead. The lesion was an abscess, and percutaneous drainage yielded pus from which K. oxytoca was isolated. Parenteral levofloxacin was administrated leading to resolution of infection signs. Because of the rarity of the pathogen, evaluation for underlying illnesses was done, and the patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is the first report of a patient with previously undiagnosed diabetes who was found with an extraorbital abscess caused by K. oxytoca, which we present with a review of diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment.
