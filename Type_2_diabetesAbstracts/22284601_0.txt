 AIMS: We aimed to evaluate whether leptin and ghrelin responses to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are dependent on type 2 diabetes and whether these responses are associated with interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), cortisol and insulin. METHODS: We examined stress-response patterns in plasma leptin, ghrelin, hsCRP, IL-6, cortisol and insulin levels before and up to 5 days after cardiopulmonary bypass in 20 patients with type 2 diabetes and 20 patients without diabetes. RESULTS: Plasma leptin levels increased significantly in both groups (p<0.05) and rose significantly higher in diabetics when compared with nondiabetic patients (p=0.004). Plasma ghrelin levels increased significantly only in diabetics (p=0.033). Patients with and without diabetes showed significantly elevated serum concentrations of IL-6, hsCRP, cortisol and insulin (p<0.005 for IL-6, hsCRP; p<0.05 for cortisol, insulin) but the difference between the two groups was nonsignificant. Leptin was independently predicted by hsCRP (p<0.05, F=2.9), gender (women p<0.001, F=4.7), body mass index (BMI p<0.0001, F=6.1) whereas ghrelin levels were not associated with any variables in the total patient population. (critical F=2.26, pâ‰¤0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acute phase response in diabetics differs by higher leptin levels independent of BMI, gender and IL-6, hsCRP, insulin and cortisol levels.
