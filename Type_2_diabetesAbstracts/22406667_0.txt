 BACKGROUND: Relationship between type 2 DM and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is well known, with CVD being the most common cause of mortality in diabetics. Significant myocardial injury before overt CVD in DM can be identified early using echocardiography. This study therefore aimed at evaluating left ventricular structure and function of patients with type 2 DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty adult type 2 DM patients were recruited with 150 age- and sex-matched controls. Patients and subjects with systemic hypertension, pregnancy, sickle cell disease and structural heart disease were excluded from the study. Participants were evaluated clinically; had anthropometric parameters and electrocardiogram taken. Echocardiograms were obtained according to the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) recommendations. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients (55.4 ± 11.6 years) was similar to that of the control (54.2 ± 9.6 years) (P=0.348) and the duration of DM was 4.53 years. Left ventricular (LV) systolic function was normal in both groups but was higher in patients than controls (ejection fraction=70.3 ± 10.7% and 64.4 ± 9.4%, P =0.001 respectively). The prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) was 72% in the patients compared with 6% in controls (P=0.001). Patients' age, body weight, duration of DM, LV mass index and left atrial dimension were positive correlates of LVDD while patients' age, weight and left atrial dimension were independent predictors of LVDD. CONCLUSION: There is high prevalence of alterations in LV structure and function in normotensive type 2 DM; and there is a need for early intervention to prevent overt LV dysfunction.
