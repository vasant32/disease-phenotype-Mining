 OBJECTIVES: Following pregnancies with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), to assess: the perception by women of the risk of subsequent type 2 diabetes, the rate of screening for diabetes in the postpartum, and identify the factors leading women to undergo screening, in particular with respect to the information given to the general practitioner (GP) by the obstetrical team. METHODS: A cohort study of all women with GDM who delivered in a single academic hospital between 1st June 2008 and 31st May 2009, based on data extracted from files and from phone interviews made 6 to 12 months after the delivery. RESULTS: Out of 152 GDM cases, 147 medical files were consulted and 124 phone interviews were performed. Fifty-one percent of the interviewed women were aware of the risk of type 2 diabetes. Eighty patients (65%) underwent postpartum glucose testing, out of which 69 were prescribed by the maternity and 27 women (22%) did not get any prescription. The compliance rate was 78% (53/69) for the hospital prescriptions and 100% (18/18) for the GP's prescriptions, a significant difference in uptake (P<0.05). Although it appears that the information given to the GP is the only factor improving patient awareness about type 2 diabetes (P=0.01), as well as their compliance to postpartum glucose testing (P=0.02), only 41 reports (28%) were sent to the GP out of the 63 reports (43%) mentioning the GDM. CONCLUSION: Postpartum testing for type 2 diabetes following a GDM was not optimal in this study. In view of the key role played by the GP in the postpartum period, it appears that cooperation between maternity and GPs needs to be reinforced in order to maximise both proper screening and diabetes primary prevention following GDM.
