BACKGROUND & AIMS: Japan has experienced a jump in the diabetes prevalence rates. We want to examine whether increased intake of soft drink and juices have contributed to this jump. METHODS: Participants were 27,585 Japanese men and women aged 40-59 years who had no prior history of diabetes. Intakes of soft drink, 100% fruit juice and vegetable juice were measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios of type 2 diabetes over 5 and 10 years were estimated by using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 484 men and 340 women reported newly diagnosed diabetes during10 years. High soft drink intake was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in women but not men; odds ratio (95% CI) for women with almost daily consumption versus non-consumers was 2.10 (1.23-3.59; P-trend = 0.004) and 1.79 (1.11-2.89; P-trend = 0.01) at 5 and 10 years, respectively. The association was evident in overweight, highly educated and premenopausal women, and women with blue collar job. Intakes of 100% fruit juice and vegetable juice were not associated with risk of type 2 diabetes for either gender (P-trend >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Soft drink but not pure juices consumption was associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes in Japanese women.
