A strong correlation exists between improved blood glucose control, obtained from the earliest stages of diabetes, and the prevention of complications. However, tight glycometabolic control does not always translate into an advantage for every patient. Because the characteristics of individual patients play an important role in diabetes care, there is a need to develop personalized action plans. This article suggests tailored therapeutic algorithms for some of the commonest type 2 diabetes phenotypes, taking into consideration age, body mass index, presence of micro- and macrovascular complications, hypoglycemia risk, and the co-existence of chronic renal failure. Particular emphasis is placed on exploiting information supplied through the rational use of self-monitoring of blood glucose as a tool for optimizing diabetes management, according to the prevalence of fasting/preprandial or postprandial hyperglycemia.
