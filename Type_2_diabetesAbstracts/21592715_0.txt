 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of ongoing group based diabetes self-management education (DSME) for patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 146 patients were randomised to either group education or waiting list control. Primary outcomes were A1C and patient activation measured with patient activation measure (PAM). RESULTS: There were no differences in the primary outcomes between the groups at 12 months, but the control group had an increase in A1C of 0.3% points during follow-up. Diabetes knowledge and some self-management skills improved significantly in the intervention group compared to the control group. A sub group analysis was conducted for the quartile with the highest A1C at baseline (>7.7, n=18 in both groups). There were significant improvements within the intervention group at 12 month follow-up for both A1C and PAM and a trend for better outcome in the intervention group compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: The locally developed ongoing diabetes self-management education programs prevented an increase in A1C and can have an effect on A1C in patients with higher A1C level. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Locally developed programs may be less effective than programs developed for studies.
