PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to review the treatment of a patient with type 2 diabetes who is commonly seen in practice-specifically, a middle-aged obese patient with micro- and macrovascular complications whose A1C rises after therapeutic intervention. Discussion of glucose management, as well as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity comorbidities, is included. CONCLUSION: The key to successful treatment is individualization of targets and therapeutic choices. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, including aiding with A1C reduction and weight loss. Using a combination of old and new treatments for the management of diabetes can help to improve outcomes.
