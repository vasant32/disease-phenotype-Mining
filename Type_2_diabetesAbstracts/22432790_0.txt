INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes often involves derangements in lipid levels in addition to insulin resistance and diminishing insulin secretion. Colesevelam hydrochloride, a bile acid sequestrant (BAS), is approved for adjunctive therapy to diet and exercise for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. In clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes, colesevelam, added to existing metformin, sulfonylurea or insulin therapy, reduced hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) by a mean of 0.5% and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) by 13-17%. AREAS COVERED: Information pertaining to colesevelam and other BAS was collected using a PubMed literature search of journal articles dating from 1960 to present. Additional articles were identified from bibliographies and from abstracts from American Diabetes Association conferences. The authors review the pharmacology of colesevelam as well as clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability data generated from clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: Colesevelam induces moderate but significant improvements in HbA(1c) and LDL-C. Outcomes data are needed to determine whether or not colesevelam confers long-term protection against micro- and macrovascular complications. Although colesevelam does not induce weight gain, triglyceride levels tend to increase ~ 15%, the implications of which are unknown at this time. The mechanism(s) by which colesevelam improves glycemia are not yet understood but might involve enhanced meal-induced incretin secretion and altered farnesoid X receptor signaling.
