MicroRNAs belong to a newly identified class of small non-coding RNAs that have been widely implicated in the fine-tuning of many physiological processes such as the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Microarray studies have highlighted an altered profile of miRNA expression in insulin target tissues in diabetic and obese models. Emerging evidences suggest that miRNAs play significant roles in insulin production, secretion and actions, as well as in diverse aspects of glucose homeostasis and adipocyte differentiation. The identification of tissue-specific miRNAs implicated in T2D and obesity might be useful for the future development of effective strategies for early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of obesity-related medical complications.
