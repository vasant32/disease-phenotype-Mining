The aim of the study was to determine the effect of a single bout of exercise on GLUT4 gene expression in muscle of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and control subjects, matched for age and body mass index. Nine patients with T2D and nine control subjects performed 60 min of cycling exercise at ~55% peak power (W(max) ). Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline, immediately post and 3-h post exercise. GLUT4 mRNA expression increased (p < 0.05) to a similar extent immediately post exercise in control (~60%) and T2D (~66%) subjects, and remained elevated (p < 0.05) 3-h post exercise with no differences between groups. Similarly, p-AMP-activated protein kinase, p38 mitogen-activated kinase and proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator-alpha mRNA expression were increased (p < 0.05) post exercise, and were not different between the groups. In conclusion, a single bout of exercise increased skeletal muscle GLUT4 mRNA expression in patients with T2D to a similar extent as in control subjects.
