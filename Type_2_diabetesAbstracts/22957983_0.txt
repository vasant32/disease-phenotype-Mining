As our understanding of diabetes has evolved over the last 50 years, the diagnostic criteria for diabetes have changed. The diagnosis of diabetes has classically been determined as the glycaemic threshold for progression to microvascular disease, predominantly retinopathy. By the 1960s, the oral glucose tolerance test had become established as the means by which Type 2 diabetes should be identified, but there was inconsistency as to how the test should be performed, in the quantity of glucose that should be ingested and the diagnostic blood glucose cut-offs. © 2012 The Authors.
