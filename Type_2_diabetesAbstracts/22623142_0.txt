To assess the association between type 2 diabetes and rs10811661 polymorphism, upstream of CDKN2A/B, a literature-based search was conducted to collect data. The pooled OR (odds ratio) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the strength of association between rs10811661 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes. OR with 95 % CI were performed for allele contrasts, additive genetic model, dominant genetic model and recessive genetic model, respectively. The effect model was used if there was heterogeneity between studies. Funnel plots were used to predict publication bias. 17 studies with 29,990 cases and 40,977 controls were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Significant association was found in all of the four genetic models: allele contrast (OR = 1.21, 95 % CI 1.18-1.24), additive genetic model (OR = 1.51, 95 % CI 1.40-1.63), dominant genetic model (OR = 1.37, 95 % CI 1.28-1.47) and recessive genetic model (OR = 1.25, 95 % CI 1.21-1.29). The meta-analysis indicated that rs10811661 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes.
