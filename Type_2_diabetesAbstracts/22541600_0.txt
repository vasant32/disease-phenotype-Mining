 AIMS: To evaluate the current procedures in French general practice of intensifying hypoglycaemic treatment in orally treated type 2 diabetic patients, according to the French recommendations. METHODS: Type 2 diabetic patient characteristics, HbA(1c) values, hypoglycaemic treatment and physician characteristics were collected from the electronic records of a panel of French general practitioners. Factors associated with the time until intensification of treatment were studied with the Cox model. RESULTS: Among 17 493 orally treated patients with at least two available HbA(1c) values, 3118 patients (18%) required treatment intensification; 65% were on monotherapy, 31% on bitherapy and 4% on tritherapy. These patients were followed for a maximum of 14 months or until treatment was intensified. Treatment was intensified after the second high HbA(1c) value for 1212 patients (39%); this was immediate for 13% of these patients, within 6 months for 39% and within one year for 59%. Treatment intensification was less likely the older the patient, and more likely the higher the first HbA(1c) value, up to an HbA(1c) threshold of 9%. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic inertia in caring for type 2 diabetic patients in France is frequent, at least for patients treated in general practice. This inadequate glycaemic control would be expected to have significant patient and public health consequences, with higher rates of associated diabetic complications.
