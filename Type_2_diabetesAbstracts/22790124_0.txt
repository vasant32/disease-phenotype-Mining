 OBJECTIVE: To clarify the clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetic patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and to assess whether NAFLD is related to angiopathy. METHODS: The study included 388 Japanese type 2 diabetic outpatients without viral hepatitis. The main outcome measures were angiopathy and NAFLD. RESULTS: The 388 subjects were divided into two subgroups based on alcohol consumption. Fatty liver was recognized in 36 of the 142 drinking patients (25%). There was no association of fatty liver disease with diabetic macro- or microangiopathy in these patients. Fatty liver disease (namely, NAFLD) was recognized in 77 of the 246 non-drinking patients (31%). Type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD had a significantly younger age, higher body mass index level, higher levels of HbA1c, total cholesterol and triglyceride, lower HDL-C level, higher prevalence rates of hypercholesterolemia and obesity than counterparts without NAFLD. In addition, individuals in the elderly (â‰¥65 years) non-drinking group with NAFLD had a significantly higher prevalence rates of diabetic macroangiopathy, coronary heart disease and thicker intima-media thickness level than their counterparts without NAFLD. The logistic regression analysis showed that NAFLD is an independent predictor of diabetic macroangiopathy. Conclusion: NAFLD was associated with an increased prevalence of diabetic macroangiopathy and coronary heart disease in elderly patients. In addition, NAFLD is an independent predictor for diabetic macroangiopathy. These findings suggest that type 2 diabetic patients with NAFLD should be considered as a high risk group for developing macroangiopathy, even if macroangiopathy is not clinically detected.
