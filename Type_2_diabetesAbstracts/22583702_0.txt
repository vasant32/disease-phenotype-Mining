Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX-1) is activated by oxidative stress, and gene responsiveness is reportedly determined by the number of dinucleotide (GT(n)) repeats in its highly polymorphic promoter region. "Short" (S; GT(n)<25) alleles reportedly associate with higher response, lower oxidative stress, lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2DM), and better glycemic control and outcome, but data are conflicting. We investigated GT(n) in type 2DM subjects (all ethnic Chinese) in relation to basal glycemic control, oxidative stress, and outcome during up to 9 years' follow-up. Fasting blood from 418 type 2 DM subjects was collected at entry for GT(n) genotyping, glycated hemoglobin, glucose, lipids, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidants. A subset (n=368) was followed for up to 9 years for incident complications or death. GT(n) genotype distribution was 128, 182, and 108 for, respectively, S/S, S/L, and L/L. No significant differences in glycemic control, lipids, or oxidative stress were seen across genotypes. During follow-up, 168/368 subjects developed complications. No association was seen with GT(n). No difference in plasma HO-1 was seen between genotypes in a small substudy (S/S n=21 vs L/L n=23). Glycated hemoglobin and lymphocytic DNA damage was higher (p<0.05) at entry in the incident complications group. No other significant differences were seen in oxidative stress or antioxidants. Data do not support the postulated link between HMOX-1 microsatellite polymorphism and type 2 DM or the putative beneficial effect of the S allele on glycemic control, oxidative stress, or outcome in type 2 DM patients, at least in this particular population.
