The GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide has been approved for adjunctive treatment of type 2 diabetes. Continuous GLP-1 infusion improves endothelial function in vivo; no evidence about a beneficial effect of exenatide on vascular function has been published. The aim of our observational study was to evaluate whether exenatide would improve brachial artery function evaluated by the flow mediated dilation (FMD) technique, compared with glimepiride, in subjects with type 2 diabetes. FMD time course was assessed by ultrasound, after 5 min forearm ischaemia, at baseline and after 16-week treatment. At the end of the study FMD was significantly higher in subjects who assumed exenatide compared with glimepiride (9.1 ± 3.6 vs. 5.6 ± 1.0, p = 0.01). Even if limited by the small number of studied subjects, who were not matched in the two treatment groups, this research study represents the first FMD evidence suggesting that chronic administration of exenatide improves arterial dilation.
