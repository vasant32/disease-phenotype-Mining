 OBJECTIVE: Glycaemic control is critical to prevent diabetic complications and mortality. This 6-month, open-label, observational study assessed the efficacy and safety of switching Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes from neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin to insulin detemir. METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 126) receiving basal-bolus insulin therapy with NPH insulin plus rapid-acting insulin analogues were recruited. NPH insulin was replaced with insulin detemir for 6 months. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting plasma glucose  (FPG), daily glucose levels and hypoglycaemia were monitored. Nocturnal quality of life was assessed by insulin therapy related quality of life at night questionnaire. RESULTS: HbA(1c), FPG and body weight were all significantly reduced after treatment with insulin detemir for 6 months,  without increasing severe hypoglycaemia. Insulin dose increased significantly over the same time. There were significant improvements in overall nocturnal quality of life, as well as well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with insulin detemir for 6 months resulted in substantial benefits, including  reduced HbA(1c), FPG and body weight, and improvements in nocturnal quality of life, without increasing hypoglycaemia.
