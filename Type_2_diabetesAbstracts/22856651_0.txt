Abstract   Objective: The role of the endogenous secretory receptor for advanced glycation end products (esRAGE) in depression of diabetes patients and its clinical significance are unclear. This study investigated the role of serum esRAGE in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with depression in the Chinese population.   Patients and Methods: One hundred nineteen hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited at Fujian Provincial Hospital (Fuzhou, China) from February 2010 to January 2011. All selected subjects were assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Among them, 71 patients with both type 2 diabetes and depression were included. All selected subjects were examined for the following: esRAGE concentration, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood lipids, C-reactive protein, trace of albumin in urine, and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT). Association between serum esRAGE levels and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus with depression was also analyzed.   Results: There were statistically significant differences in gender, age, body mass index, waist circumference, and treatment methods between the group with depression and the group without depression (P<0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that HAMD scores were negatively correlated with esRAGE levels (standard regression coefficient -0.270, P<0.01). HAMD-17 scores were positively correlated with IMT (standard regression coefficient 0.183, P<0.05) and with HbA1c (standard regression coefficient 0.314, P<0.01).   Conclusions: Female gender, younger age, obesity, poor glycemic control, complications, and insulin therapy are all risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus with combined depression in the Chinese population. Inflammation and atherosclerosis play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. esRAGE is a protective factor of depression among patients who have type 2 diabetes.
