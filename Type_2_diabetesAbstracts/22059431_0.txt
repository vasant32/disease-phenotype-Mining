 BACKGROUND: The concept of classification of clinical data can be utilized in the development of an effective diagnosis system by taking the advantage of computational intelligence. Diabetes disease diagnosis via proper interpretation of the diabetes data is an important problem in neural networks. Unfortunately, although several classification studies have been carried out with significant performance, many of the current methods often fail to reach out to patients. Graphical user interface-enabled tools need to be developed through which medical practitioners can simply enter the health profiles of their patients and receive an instant diabetes prediction with an acceptable degree of confidence. METHODS: In this study, the neural network approach was used for a dataset of 768 persons from a Pima Indian population living near Phoenix, AZ. A neural network mixture of experts model was trained with these data using the expectation-minimization algorithm. RESULTS: The mixture of experts method was used to train the algorithm with 97% accuracy. A graphical user interface was developed that would work in conjunction with the trained network to provide the output in a presentable format. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a machine-implementable approach that can be used by physicians and patients to minimize the extent of error in diagnosis. The authors are hopeful that replication of results of this study in other populations may lead to improved diagnosis. Physicians can simply enter the health profile of patients and get the diagnosis for diabetes type 2.
