How to use oral antidiabetic fixed-dose combination tablet for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM)? In addition to diet and exercise, the majority of diabetic patients need drug therapy to achieve optimal glycemic control. Monotherapy with oral antidiabetic agent is the firstline pharmacologic treatment option. However, in order to maintain glycemic control, additional oral antidiabetic agents are often added to monotherapies resulting in dual therapy. Dual therapy can be prescribed as separate pills, or as a single pill containing two agents. Randomized controlled trials of patients requiring dual therapy, have shown fixed-dose combination therapies to have superior efficacy when compared to loose-pills combination therapies. T2DM patients treated with fixed-dose combination therapies may have better adherence, improved satisfaction, and lower direct costs, compared to those treated with loose-pill combination therapies.
