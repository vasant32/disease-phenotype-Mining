 AIMS: To determine the risk of amputation and the influencing factors for amputation for patients with type 2 diabetes with diabetic foot syndrome. METHODS: Longitudinal data from general practices in Germany (Disease Analyzer database, IMS Health) were analyzed. 3892 type 2 diabetes patients (mean age: 66.0 (SD: 10.9years), 39.1% female) with a first-time diagnosis of diabetic foot syndrome between 01/200 and 12/2004 and at least 5year follow-up documentation in the practices were included. The analyses of amputation-free survival were carried out using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. A multivariate Cox regression model was fitted with the incident of diabetes-associated amputations as the dependent variable and adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULT: The cumulative incidence of diabetes-associated lower limb amputations was 18.2%. Amputations are independently associated with higher age, male gender, higher HbA1c value and longer diabetes duration but also some other diabetes complications. DISCUSSION: The diabetic foot syndrome can but must not lead to a lower limb amputation. Due to the great medical and economic burden on the health system caused by diabetic complications, early therapeutic intervention is essential for patients with diabetic foot syndrome.
