 BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is common in hospitalized patients and is often accompanied by comorbidities; it is thus reasonable to ask whether the current standard treatments for type 2 diabetes are suitable for in-hospital use. We discuss the current glucose-lowering strategies and glycemic targets and derive practical recommendations for their application in hospitalized patients. METHODS: The pertinent literature, including clinical trials, review articles, guidelines, and manufacturers' information is selectively reviewed. RESULTS: In critically ill patients with diabetes, the glucose concentration target value should be 140 to 180 mg/dL. In stable patients, the target should be less than 140 mg/dL in the fasting state and less than 180 mg/dL after meals. Hypoglycemic episodes should be strictly avoided. Temporary treatment with insulin is indicated for most hospitalized patients with diabetes, although oral antidiabetic agents may be continued if the hospitalization is expected to be brief. Intravenous insulin is advisable in certain situations, e.g., long operations or metabolic decompensation. Glucose-lowering strategies must be chosen individually for each patient, with consideration of the relevant comorbidities (e.g. coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, renal failure) and special conditions (e.g. prolonged fasting, administration of contrast agents, high-dose glucocorticoid treatment). CONCLUSION: The treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in the hospital is very different from their treatment at home. The particular conditions and comorbidities that can arise in the hospital necessitate flexible, individualized strategies for lowering blood glucose concentration.
