 OBJECTIVE: Type 1 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) are thought to result from immune-mediated β-cell destruction. It remains unclear why LADA is clinically less severe compared to type 1 diabetes. This study aimed to compare the pro-inflammatory (interferon-γ, IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory (interleukin-13, IL-13) T-cell responses in humans with LADA and type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: IFN-γ and IL-13 T-cell responses to a panel of 16 (auto)-antigens were tested using an enzyme linked immune-spot technique and peripheral T-cells from 35 patients with type 1 diabetes, 59 patients with type 2 diabetes, 23 LADA patients, and 42 control subjects. RESULTS: LADA and type 1 diabetes patients did not display any statistically significant differences in the frequency of IFN-γ or IL-13 responses to auto-antigenic stimuli, positive control or mitogen. Overall very low T cell reactivity to autoantigens was detected in all groups. IL-13 responses but not IFN-γ responses to recall antigen tetanus toxoid were higher in healthy control subjects compared to patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or LADA (P<0.05). Diabetes, independent of type, was associated with weaker response to recall antigen tetanus toxoid. CONCLUSIONS: LADA patients are indistinguishable from type 1 diabetes patients for cellular IFN-γ and IL-13 responses upon mitogen and recall antigen stimulation. These results extend previous findings showing that systemic cytokine/chemokine and humoral responses in type 1 diabetes and LADA are similar.
