Aims  To investigate whether brachial blood pressure (BP) variables [systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) BP, pulse (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] are similar determinants of prevalent electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in sub-Saharan Africans with type 2 diabetes. Methods  The study included 420 individuals (49% men) with type 2 diabetes who were receiving chronic care in two main referral centers in the two major cities (Douala and Yaounde) of Cameroon. Logistic regressions models were used to estimate the odd ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for a standard deviation (SD) higher level of SBP (25 mmHg), DBP (13), PP (18) and MAP (20) with the risk of LVH. Discrimination was assessed and compared with c-statistics and relative integrated discrimination improvement (RIDI, %). Results  The multivariable adjusted OR (95% CI) for prevalent LVH with each SD higher pressure variable was: 1.61 (1.22-2.11) for SBP, 1.27 (0.99-1.63) for DBP, 1.62 (1.23-2.15) for PP and 1.44 (1.11-1.87) for MAP. C-statistics comparison showed no difference in the discrimination power of models with each of the BP variables (p-values>0.09). However, RIDI showed an enhancement in models' discrimination when other BP variables were replaced with PP. Such an enhancement however was marginal for SBP. Using BP combinations modestly improved discrimination. Conclusions  PP and SBP were the best predictors of prevalent LVH in this population, while DBP was the less effective predictor. These findings have implications for cardiovascular risk stratification and monitoring of risk reducing therapies.
