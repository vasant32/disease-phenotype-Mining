Liraglutide is a Glucagon like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which stimulates GLP-1 receptors and consequently leads to various cardio-metabolic and glycemic improvements in individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). It is administered once daily as a subcutaneous injection and has been extensively studied in randomized placebo and active comparator studies demonstrating favorable effects on glycemic control and weight reduction. This short review summarizes the role and practical use of this agent in the context of efficacy and safety information obtained during clinical trials.
