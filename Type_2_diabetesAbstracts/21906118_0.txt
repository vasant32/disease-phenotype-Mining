 OBJECTIVE: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of bone fractures than nondiabetics. However, the risk factors for fractures in patients with diabetes have not been fully evaluated. This study was designed to evaluate the relative frequency of fractures at different sites and the diabetes-associated factors that affect nontraumatic bone fracture in patients with type 2 diabetes. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: This retrospective case-control study recruited 144 patients with type 2 diabetes, who presented with nontraumatic fractures between March 2004 and March 2009 and 150 age-, gender-, body mass index (BMI)- and duration of diabetes-matched control subjects. Nontraumatic fractures were confirmed using patients' medical records and radiological findings. All subjects were examined for their diabetes status and associated factors for fracture, including bone mineral density (BMD). RESULTS: Of 150 reported bone fractures, the hip was the most frequent fracture site (32·7%), followed by the upper extremity (19·3%). Nontraumatic fractures were associated with diabetic retinopathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, stroke history, previous fracture and insulin treatment (P < 0·05). In multivariate analyses, independently associated factors for bone fracture were diabetic peripheral neuropathy [odds ratio (OR) = 37·3, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1·46-652·57] and previous fracture (OR = 9·54, 95% CI = 1·18-77·37; P < 0·05). CONCLUSIONS: The hip was the most frequent site of nontraumatic fracture, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy was significantly associated with an increased risk of nontraumatic fractures in patients with type 2 diabetes.
