 AIMS: We examined the possible association of the -308G/A polymorphism of the TNF-α promoter gene in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) patients and in non-diabetic subjects with and without family history of DM2. METHODS: We studied 87 non-diabetic subjects without DM2 family history in at least one of two generations, 48 non-diabetic subjects with DM2 family history and 95 DM2 patients. Genotyping was carried out by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: The frequency of TNF-α -308G/A genotype was significantly lower in non-diabetic subjects without DM2 relatives (6%) as compared to DM2 patients (24%) (odds ratio (OR)=5.24; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.9-15.8, p<0.0005), but similar to non-diabetic subjects with DM2 relatives (29%) (OR=0.77; CI=0.3-1.7, p=0.4). Logistic regression analysis showed the association of TNF-α -308G/A polymorphism with DM2 family history (OR=5.80; CI=1.77-18.98, p<0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TNF-α -308G/A polymorphism is associated with DM2 family history and is a risk factor for DM2.
