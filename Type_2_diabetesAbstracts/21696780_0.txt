Weight loss can improve metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus but the results of conventional therapy in this respect have been discouraging. Besides achieving significant and sustained weight loss, bariatric surgery can improve or resolve type 2 diabetes mellitus in the majority of patients. Anatomical modifications and changes in the secretion of intestinal hormones can explain the superiority of malabsorptive techniques. Currently, bariatric surgery offers a therapeutic alternative for type 2 diabetes patients with severe obesity and poor metabolic control under conventional therapy. Ongoing research will provide insights regarding the effect of intestinal hormones, new surgery techniques and the possible benefits of bariatric surgery in non-obese patients.
