AIMS: To investigate therapy persistence, frequency of hypoglycaemia and macrovascular outcomes among type 2 diabetes patients with DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4) and sulfonylureas (SU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 19,184 DPP-4 (mean age: 64 yrs; 56% males) and 31,110 SU users (69 yrs; 51%) with new prescriptions (index date), without additional antidiabetics except metformin, in 1,201 general practices in Germany were analysed. Therapy discontinuation (prescription gap >90 days), hypoglycemia (ICD-10), and macrovascular outcomes (ICD-10) (2 year follow-up) were compared adjusting for age, sex, diabetes duration, metformin, previous hypoglycaemia, health insurance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, antihypertensives, lipid-lowering and antithrombotic drugs, microvascular complications, and Charlson Comorbidity Score using logistic or Cox regression models. RESULTS: Two years after index date, DDP-4 (non-persistence: 39%) were associated with a lower risk of discontinuation compared to SU (49%) (adjusted Hazard ratio, HR: 0.74; 0.71-0.76). Hypoglycemias (â‰¥1) were documented in 0.18% patients with DPP-4 and in 1.00% with SU (Odds ratio: 0.21; 95%CI: 0.08-0.57). Hypoglycemias were significantly associated with incident macrovascular complications (HR: 1.6; 1.1-2.2). Risk of macrovascular events was 26% lower in DPP-4 than in SU users. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of persistence with antidiabetic therapy is frequently found in primary care patients. DPP-4 were associated with lower therapy discontinuation and a five-fold reduced frequency of patients with hypoglycemia compared to SU. The low absolute numbers of hypoglycemias are most likely due that only severe events were documented. DPP-4 treatment was associated with reduced incidence of macrovascular events relative to SU in type 2 diabetes patients in primary care practices.
