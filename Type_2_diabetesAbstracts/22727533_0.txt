Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, a novel medication for type 2 diabetes. We describe a case of pustules in a patient recently started on liraglutide. Common side effects of liraglutide are gastrointestinal disorders. Skin and tissue reactions are less well-known side effects. Liraglutide could be the cause of skin eruptions in this patient, possibly by immunogenicity.
