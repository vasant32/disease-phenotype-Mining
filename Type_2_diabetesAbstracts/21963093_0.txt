 AIM: To evaluate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Serum 25(OH)D was measured in a cross-sectional sample of 131 men and 174 women aged 30 years and over in Korea. Arterial stiffness was assessed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) obtained with a VP-2000 pulse wave unit. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, lipid profile, HbA1c, calcium, phosphorous, and HS-CRP were measured. RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was high (85.9%). Those with lower vitamin D levels had increased PWV. Using multivariate regression analysis, low 25(OH)D concentrations independently predicted PWV (p<0.001) in people with type 2 diabetes after adjustment for other risk factors such as age, smoking, hypertension, HS-CRP, diabetes duration, hypertension duration, HbA1c, and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is common in type 2 diabetes, and a low 25(OH)D level is significantly associated with increased arterial stiffness in these patients. Vitamin D may influence the development of cardiovascular disease. Clinical intervention studies are needed to clarify whether treatment with vitamin D decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.
