African Americans (AA) have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease and vitamin D deficiency compared with Caucasians. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important signaling molecule. This study examined the hypothesis that blood levels of H2S are lower in AA type 2 diabetic patients (T2D). Fasting blood was obtained from T2D and healthy controls. Results showed a significant decrease in plasma levels of cAMP and H2S in AA T2D but not in Caucasian T2D when compared with those of respective age- and race-matched healthy controls. Plasma vitamin D levels were significantly lower in AA T2D compared with Caucasians T2D. Cell culture studies demonstrate that 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D supplementation significantly increased expression of cystathionine-Î³-lyase (CSE), H2S formation and cAMP secretion, but decreased ROS in high glucose-treated U937 monocytes. This suggests that vitamin D supplementation upregulates CSE and H2S formation and decreases oxidative stress, and that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the malfunctioning of H2S signaling and thus a higher incidence of vascular inflammation in African Americans. These results lead to the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation can replenish blood concentrations of H2S and cAMP and lower oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease in AA type 2 diabetic patients.
