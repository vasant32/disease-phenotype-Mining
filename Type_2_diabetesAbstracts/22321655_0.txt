The mechanism of bone mineral density (BMD) changes in type 2 diabetes mellitus is not clear. We aimed to investigate the effect of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics on BMD. Insulin resistance was determined using the homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR). Nineteen type 2 diabetic patients with a HOMA-IR <2.7 (mean age, 51.5±9.6yr; body mass index [BMI], 27.3±5.1kg/m(2); duration of diabetes, 10.5±7.3yr) were included in Group A, and 30 BMI- and age-matched type 2 diabetic patients with a HOMA-IR ≥2.7 were included in Group B. The BMD was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Independent t-test was used for statistical analysis. The Group A values for mean fasting glucose and insulin levels were 160.1±77.0mg/dL and 4.79±2.89μU/L, respectively, whereas the Group B values were 195.1±58.9mg/dL (p>0.05) and 19.30±16.89μU/L (p=0.0001). Significantly higher total lumbar vertebra T-score (p=0.02) and total lumbar vertebra BMD in Group A were determined than Group B (p=0.033). The lumbar vertebra total Z-score was significantly lower in Group B (p=0.042). Marked insulin resistance may have a negative effect on BMD in type 2 diabetics, while the presence of hyperinsulinemia may be associated with the low BMD.
