The objective of this study is to report the vocal characteristics of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in relation to disease duration, glycemic control, and neuropathy. This is a prospective study. The setting is institutional setting. A total of 82 patients were recruited for this study, and a healthy control group matched according to age and gender was recruited. Subjects underwent acoustic analysis and perceptual evaluation using the GRABS classification where G stands for grading, R for roughness, A for asthenia, B for breathiness, and S for straining using a scale of 0â€“3 where o stands for normal and three for severe deviation from normal. There was no significant difference in any of the acoustic variables between diabetic patients and control. There was no significant difference in the mean score of any of the perceptual evaluation parameters between diabetic patients and control, despite the fact that the mean scores were all higher in the diseased group except for roughness. When looking at subgroups, we see that diabetic patients with poor glycemic control and with neuropathy had significantly higher mean score for the G overall grade of the voice compared to controls with P values of 0.005 and 0.009, respectively. What is also worth noting is that diabetic patients with poor glycemic control had more straining compared to controls, P value 0.043. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and poor glycemic control or neuropathy have a significant difference in the grade of their voice compared to controls.
