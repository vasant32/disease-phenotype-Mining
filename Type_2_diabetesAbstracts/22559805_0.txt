Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of developing cognitive impairment in comparison with the general population. Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of dementia (vascular and/or neurodegenerative). Diabetes accelerates the progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. It has been estimated that type 2 diabetes or impairment of glucose metabolism might be present in up to 80% of patients with Alzheimer disease. The cognitive dysfunction is associated with poorer ability in diabetes self-care and decreased adherence to antidiabetic treatment.
