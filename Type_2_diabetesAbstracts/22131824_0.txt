 OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of Tinospora crispa on serum glucose and insulin levels in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHOD: Serum from 10 healthy subjects and 10 diabetic participants, who had fasted overnight, were obtained every 30-60 minutes during the 3 hours of continued fasting and during the 3 hours after ingestion of 75 g of glucose with or without ingestion of 125 or 250 g of Tinospora crispa dry powder capsule. Glucose and Insulin levels were analyzed and the areas under the curve for mean serum glucose and insulin levels were calculated. RESULT: The areas under the curve of mean serum glucose and insulin levels in both healthy and diabetic participants were not significantly different between with or without Tinospora crispa dry powder capsule. In diabetic participants the area under the curve of glucose was slightly lesser when 250 mg of Tinospora crispa was ingested, but not reaching statistical significance (478 and 444 mg min/ml, resp., P = 0.57). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that Tinospora crispa ingestion cannot affect serum glucose and insulin levels in healthy subjects or patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
