Examining interpersonal (physician-patient) communication strategies for promoting walking exercise to patients with type 2 diabetes assigned to primary care clinics, the study evaluated two message design variables-frame and presentation mode-as influencers of communication and adoption success. The single-site, four-week, prospective intervention study followed a 2Ã—3 factorial, non-equivalent comparison group quasi-experimental design. Results showed frame was significantly related to steps walked; however, when including patient activation as an interaction, frame was non-significant. The model including patient activation interactions, however, detected significant mode effects on behavior. Results provide evidence that statistics are most effectively used with activated patients.
