This study examined age differences in support, BMI, and HbA1c among African American patients with type 2 diabetes. Participants were 158 African American adults with type 2 diabetes. Average HbA1c was 1% higher among patients aged 20-49 than patients 60-77, and double the number of younger patients had a BMI â‰¥35 than older patients. Younger patients reported less trust in their physician and greater disagreement with recommendations. They reported relying less on partners, greater unresolved conflict with partners around diabetes, and less church involvement. The association between age and HbA1c was partially mediated by patients' trust of their physician.
