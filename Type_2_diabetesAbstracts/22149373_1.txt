INTRODUCTION: Metformin is considered as the first-line drug therapy for the management of type 2 diabetes. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, by promoting insulin secretion and reducing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, offer new opportunities for oral therapy after failure of metformin. AREAS COVERED: An updated review of the literature demonstrates that saxagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, and metformin may be administered together, separately or in fixed-dose combination (FDC), either as saxagliptin added to metformin or as initial combination in drug-naive patients. Both compounds exert complementary pharmacodynamic actions leading to better improvement in blood glucose control (fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, HbA1c) than either compound separately. Adding saxagliptin to metformin monthotherapy results in a consistent, sustained and safe reduction in HbA1c levels. Tolerance is excellent without hypoglycemia or weight gain. EXPERT OPINION: The combination saxaglitpin plus metformin may be used as first-line or second-line therapy in the management of type 2 diabetes, especially as a valuable alternative to the classical metformin-sulfonylurea combination.
