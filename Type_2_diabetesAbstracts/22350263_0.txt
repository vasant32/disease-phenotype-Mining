Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a metabolic, vascular, and neuropathic disease with a high risk of atherosclerotic events due to dyslipidemic states. Polymorphisms in Apolipoprotein A5 gene (APOA5) have been associated with increased triglyceride levels in many different populations. This study aimed to identify the frequencies of the APOA5 -1131T>C and SW19 polymorphisms and evaluate their effects on lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Genotyping of APOA5 -1131T>C and SW19 polymorphisms was performed by PCR-RFLP in 146 diabetic patients and in controls (n = 173), from 30 to 80 years of age. Diabetic patients were divided into two groups: patients not treated with lipid lowering drugs (group G1; n = 62) and those treated with lipid lowering drugs (group G2, n = 84). Lipids and lipoproteins were determined enzymatically. Among participants not treated with lipid-lowering drugs (diabetics G1 and controls; n = 235), the -1131C was associated with lower LDLc levels (p = 0.015). In the diabetic patients, the 19W allele was associated with higher triglyceride levels (p = 0.004). In G1 diabetic patients, the combined analysis of APOA5 -1131T>C and SW19 polymorphisms showed that [TC or CC] + SS carriers presented lower total cholesterol levels than did other genotype combinations (p = 0.049). It could therefore be concluded that APOA5 -1131T>C and SW19 polymorphisms influence lipid levels in type 2 diabetic patients.
