 AIMS: Our study addressed the influence of early inflammatory stages of diabetic kidney disease: leukocyte adhesion and monocyte activation (as assessed by intercellular leukocyte adhesion molecule-ICAM-1 and monocyte chemoatractant protein-MCP-1) on the degree of albuminuria. Plasma levels of adiponectin, a possible anti-inflammatory counteracting mechanism, were also studied in correlation to the above-mentioned cytokines. METHODS: 79 consecutive type 2 diabetic outpatients and 46 controls were included. Routine laboratory analysis, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR), plasma adiponectin, plasma ICAM-1 and urinary MPC-1 were assessed. RESULTS: In multiple regression ICAM-1 (p=0.004) and adiponectin (p=0.04) were the main determinants of uACR. Plasma adiponectin positively correlated to ICAM-1 (p=0.03, r=0.24). In albuminuric patients (uACR â‰¥30 mg/g) plasma adiponectin was significantly higher compared to normoalbuminuric ones (uACR <30 mg/g). In albuminuric patients the main determinants of uACR were plasma ICAM-1 and adiponectin. In multiple regression ICAM-1 is the only one that retains statistical significance (p=0.02). Urinary MCP-1 did not correlate to uACR. CONCLUSIONS: In our type 2 diabetic patients, plasma levels of ICAM-1 and adiponectin are predictive for albuminuria. Urinary MCP-1 does not correlated to uACR. Plasma adiponectin positively correlates to adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in our cohort.
