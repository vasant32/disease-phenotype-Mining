 OBJECTIVES: To describe daytime non-severe hypoglycemic events (NSHEs), assess their impact on patient functioning and diabetes self-management, and examine if these impacts differ by diabetes type or country. METHODS: Internet survey to adults with diabetes in the US, UK, Germany, and France. RESULTS: Of 6756 screened respondents, 2439 reported a daytime NSHE in the past month. NSHEs occurred while active (e.g., running errands) (45.1%), 29.6% while not active (e.g., watching TV), and 23.8% at work. On average, it took half a day to respond and recover from NSHE. Respondents monitored their glucose 5.7 extra times on average over the following week. On the day of event, type 1 respondents tested significantly more often than type 2 (p<0.05). Type 2 were less likely to confirm NSHE with glucose test (p<0.001). Following NSHE, 12.6% of respondents reduced total insulin by an average of 7.6 units (SD=8.3). Total units and days with reduced dosing was significantly less, whilst number of additional glucose tests and time to recover was significantly longer if NSHE occurred at work (p<0.001). Type 1 decreased insulin doses more often (p<0.001); however, type 2 decreased a greater number of units (p<0.01). Compared with other countries, US respondents were more likely to eat a light or full meal and respondents in France took significantly longer than all other countries to recognize (p<0.05), respond to (p<0.001), and recover from (p<0.001) NSHE, used significantly more monitoring tests the day of (p<0.05) and over the subsequent week (p<0.001), and decreased their normal insulin dose more (p<0.001). Limitations of the study include potential recall bias and selection bias. CONCLUSIONS: NSHEs are associated with a significant impact on patient functioning and diabetes management.
