Mucormycosis is an uncommon fungal infection caused by Mucorales. It frequently occurs in patients with neutropenia, diabetes, malignancy and on corticoid therapy. However, it is rare in patients with AIDS. Clinical disease can be manifested in several forms. The case reported illustrates the rare occurrence of chromoblastomycosis and mucormycosis in an immunosuppressed patient with multibacillary leprosy, under prolonged corticosteroid and thalidomide therapy to control leprosy type 2 reaction. Neutrophil dysfunction, thalidomide therapy and work activities are some of the risk factors in this case. Chromoblastomycosis was treated by surgical excision and mucormycosis with amphotericin B. Although the prognosis of mucormycosis is generally poor, in the reported case the patient recovered successfully. This case should alert dermatologists to possible opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed patients.
