 AIMS: To examine the association between type 2 diabetes and serious psychological distress (SPD) and to assess if SPD was an independent risk factor for health risk behaviors and diabetes care among adults with diabetes. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was performed using the 2007 California Health Interview Survey with adults in California. Multiple logistic models were used to examine the associations between the multiple risk and outcome factors. RESULTS: Of the participants, 6.9% of adults had diagnoses of type 2 diabetes. SPD was present in 7.0% of adults with diabetes but only in 3.5% of adults without diabetes. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that participants with diabetes were significantly more likely than those without diabetes to experience SPD (OR=1.81; 95% CI=[1.3-2.5], p=0.0002), adjusting for other factors. In addition, participants with diabetes and SPD were more likely to report insufficient physical activity and more current cigarette smoking than participants without SPD. SPD among participants with diabetes, however, did not significantly affect good diabetes care. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that adults with diabetes are more likely to experience SPD than adults without diabetes. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms for this association among adults with both diabetes and SPD.
