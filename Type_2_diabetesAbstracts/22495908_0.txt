The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to determine the efficacy of Five-Element Gymnastics (FEG) in controlling glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) at the 8th and the 16th weeks of intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes in Taiwan. FEG consolidates several traditional Chinese exercises including Qigong, Xiang Gong, and martial arts with gymnastics. The experimental group (n = 31) practiced FEG at home for 16 weeks. The control group (n = 35) maintained usual activities. FEG was associated with decrease of HbA1C, TG, and LDL-C levels at the 8th week and continuous decrease of HbA1C through the 16th week. FEG could be an exercise choice for patients with type 2 diabetes.
