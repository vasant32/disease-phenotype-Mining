 BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the emotional approach to coping on diabetes outcomes. This study examined the relationship between emotional coping and diabetes knowledge, medication adherence and self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Data on 378 subjects with type 2 diabetes recruited from two primary care clinics in the southeastern United States were examined. Previously validated scales were used to measure coping, medication adherence, diabetes knowledge and diabetes self-care behaviors (including diet, physical activity, blood sugar testing and foot care). Multiple linear regression was used to assess the independent effect of coping through emotional approach on medication adherence and self-care behaviors while controlling for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Significant correlations were observed between emotional coping [as measured by emotional expression (EE) and emotional processing (EP)] and self-care behaviors. In the linear regression model, EP was significantly associated with medication adherence [β -0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.32 to -0.015], diabetes knowledge (β 0.76, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.24), diet (β 0.52, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.81), exercise (β 0.51, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82), blood sugar testing (β 0.54, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.91) and foot care (β 0.32, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.67). On the other hand, EE was associated with diet (β 0.38, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.64), exercise (β 0.54, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.82), blood sugar testing (β 0.42, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.76) and foot care (β 0.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.66), but it was not associated with diabetes knowledge. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that coping through an emotional approach is significantly associated with behaviors that lead to positive diabetes outcomes.
