 OBJECTIVE: Overproduction of intestinally derived apoB-48-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) (chylomicrons) has recently been described in type 2 diabetes, as is known for hepatic TRL-apoB-100 (very-low-density lipoprotein) production. Furthermore, insulin acutely inhibits both intestinal and hepatic TRL production, whereas this acute inhibitory effect on very-low-density lipoprotein production is blunted in type 2 diabetes. It is not currently known whether this acute effect on chylomicron production is similarly blunted in humans with type 2 diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effect of acute hyperinsulinemia on TRL metabolism in 18 type 2 diabetic men using stable isotope methodology. Each subject underwent 1 control (saline infusion [SAL]) lipoprotein turnover study followed by a second study, under 1 of the 3 following clamp conditions: (1) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic, (2) hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic, or (3) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic plus intralipid and heparin. TRL-apoB-48 and TRL-apoB-100 production and clearance rates were not different between SAL and clamp and between the different clamp conditions, except for significantly lower TRL-apoB-100 clearance and production rates in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic plus intralipid and heparin clamp compared with SAL. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration in individuals with type 2 diabetes that chylomicron production is resistant to the normal acute suppressive effect of insulin. This phenomenon may contribute to the highly prevalent dyslipidemia of type 2 diabetes and potentially to atherosclerosis. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.
