Background/Aims: H. pylori eradication therapy has been widely performed. In addition, the number of patients with type 2 diabetes is increasing worldwide. The aim of this study was to understand the influence of H. pylori eradication therapy on the management of type 2 diabetes. Methodology: A total of 174 patients with type 2 diabetes who did not have an active peptic ulcer or serious complications and were cured successfully of their H. pylori infection at our institute were included in this study. The time course of mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values and body mass index (BMI) during the year before and after H. pylori eradication were assessed by a paired Student's t-test. Results: No significant changes in mean HbA1c values were observed during the year before or after eradication. However, the mean BMI, which did not change during the year before eradication, increased significantly at 6 months (23.1±2.6kg/m2, p<0.05) and 12 months (23.1±2.7kg/m2, p<0.05) after eradication as compared with the time point of eradication (22.9±2.6kg/m2). Conclusions: H. pylori eradication significantly increased BMI but not HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes, despite diabetes treatment.
