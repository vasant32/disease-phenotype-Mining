 PURPOSE: Type 2 diabetes increases risk of chronic disease. The recommendations are for youth to attain at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity (PA). Fewer than 20% achieve this goal. This study examines differences between blood glucose control and PA in youth with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A1c levels and PA were tested in youth 9 to 17 years old with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes during clinic visits. Average daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was calculated. Differences in MVPA were investigated. RESULTS: Slightly more than half of youth had well-controlled diabetes. All engaged in less PA than recommended. Youth with well-controlled diabetes engaged in slightly less MVPA than those whose diabetes was not in control. There were no significant differences in minutes of MVPA by gender, race, or diabetes control. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to identify ways to increase PA among youth with type 2 diabetes.
