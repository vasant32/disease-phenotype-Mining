 BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia plays an important role in etiology of vascular complications like atherosclerosis in diabetes. Oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. The aim of the present study is to compare the antioxidant potential (AOP) of LDL in type 2 diabetic men and women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out in 80 diabetic subjects and 80 control subjects. The men (40) and women (40) in the diabetic groups were studied separately and matched for age (50-60 years), body mass index (BMI), duration of diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin, and lipid profile. LDL from the serum sample was precipitated by heparin citrate precipitation method. For the measurement of AOP in LDL, we used xanthine-xanthine oxidase method. RESULTS: Our results showed that AOP value was significantly low in diabetic women (P < 0.05) in comparison with diabetic men. CONCLUSION: It is therefore suggested that LDL from type 2 diabetic women is more prone for oxidation.
