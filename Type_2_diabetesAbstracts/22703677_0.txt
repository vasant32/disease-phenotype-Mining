Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) emerged among children, due in large measure to a strong physiological link between increased weight states and T2DM. In this article, cumulative risk factors for T2DM across childhood and its underlying mechanisms are reviewed. The points of intervention for T2DM should occur throughout childhood. The use of Halfon and Hochstein's framework enables practitioners and researchers in the nursing field to better understand a child's individual risk for T2DM. Only with this long view will prevention and interventions be successful in stemming the tide of the "twin epidemic" threatening children worldwide.
