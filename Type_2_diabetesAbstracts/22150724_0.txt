 AIMS: Systemic concentrations of adhesion molecules and chemokines are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular complications. We compared these factors between patients with Type 2 diabetes vs. Type 1 diabetes or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. METHODS: Serum concentrations of adhesion molecules sE-selectin, sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1, and chemokines CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4 were measured in 61 patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, 90 with Type 1 diabetes, 465 with Type 2 diabetes and in 41 control subjects, using multiple regression models to adjust for possible confounders. RESULTS: Patients with Type 2 diabetes exhibited greater concentrations of adhesion molecules (P < 0.02) than those with Type 1 diabetes, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and control subjects. These differences persisted upon adjustments for age, sex, BMI, blood pressure and diabetes duration (P < 0.04). Higher BMI positively correlated with concentrations of adhesion molecules in all subjects (P < 0.0001). Concentrations of sE-selectin positively related to diastolic (β = 0.31) and systolic (β = 0.28) blood pressure in the adjusted model (P < 0.04). Concentrations of the chemokines, CCL2 and CCL4, did not differ between groups, while CCL3 was higher in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and Type 1 diabetes than in those with Type 2 diabetes and control subjects (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic concentrations of adhesion molecules, but not chemokines, relate to cardiovascular risk factors, but remain higher after adjustments in Type 2 diabetes, suggesting a diabetes-type specific effect without difference between latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and Type 1 diabetes, despite their dissimilar phenotype.
