AIMS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are serious comorbidities. Effects of OSAS on diabetic microvascular complications are ongoing research subjects. We evaluated the incidence of OSAS in Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with nephropathy and with no renal involvement. METHODS: A total of 52 people with diabetes were enrolled in this study. Patients body mass indices were calculated and fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, urea, creatinine, total lipid profile, and urinary albumin excretion were evaluated. Full polysomnography was used to detect sleep disorders. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and laboratory results of the patients were similar. Meeting criteria for OSAS was detected in 35 of the 54 patients (67.3%). 25 patients (48%) had mild, six patients (11.5%) had moderate, and four patients (7.7%) had severe sleep disorders. There was no significant relationship between respiratory obstructive parameters and microalbuminuria (R=0.91, p=0.362). Substantial correlation was detected between lower values of serum triglyceride levels and lower respiratory indices (R=0.299, p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes accompanying OSAS affects glucose regulation but its effect on nephropathy development is currently a subject of research.
