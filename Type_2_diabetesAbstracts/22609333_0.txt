We examined whether the rate of eating was associated with the body mass index and glycemic control status in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (50% women, mean±SD age 59.4±7.5years). Rapid eating was significantly associated with body mass index (p=0.047). The body mass index of those who reported eating quickly was 0.8kg/m(2) higher than in individuals who reported eating at medium speed even after adjustment for known confounders. No significant association was observed between the rate of eating and HbA(1c). Our findings suggest an association between self-reported rapid eating and an elevated body mass index in patients with type 2 diabetes.
