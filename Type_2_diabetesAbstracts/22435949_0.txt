 AIMS: To determine the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic maculopathy in Japanese patients older than 65 years-of-age with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, to determine the relationship between the severity of retinopathy and maculopathy, and the risk factors for these conditions in Japanese patients with the same characteristics. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study carried out at the enrolment of patients who participated in a randomized controlled trial. A total of 960 eyes of 960 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes who were ≥ 65 years-of-age were analyzed. RESULTS: Our data showed that there was a correlation between the severity of retinopathy and the severity of maculopathy. The risk factors for the severity of retinopathy were different from the risk factors for the severity of maculopathy. The age, duration of diabetes, systemic pulse pressure, fasting insulin, insulin treatment of diabetes, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio and history of cerebrovascular disease all contributed significantly to the severity of retinopathy. The duration of diabetes, insulin treatment and microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio were correlated with the severity of maculopathy. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors related to diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged ≥ 65 years were different from that in other countries. Our data also showed that the certain risk factors for retinopathy differ from those associated with maculopathy.
