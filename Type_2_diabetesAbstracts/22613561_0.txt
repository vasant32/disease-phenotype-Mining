 AIMS: To determine genetic predispsitions for diabetic cerebral ischemia, we investigated the relationship between the -866G>A polymorphism of uncoupling protein (UCP) 2 and the risk of ischemic stroke in two cohorts of type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: A total of 844 type 2 diabetic patients with 4-year prospective study were examined using a case-control methodology. And 404 cases with ischemical stroke, 440 cases without ischemical stroke. The -866G>A polymorphism in UCP2 was genotyped by TaqMan MGB probe method. RESULTS: The -866G>A SNP in UCP2 was significantly associated with diabetic ischemical stroke (odds ratio [OR]= 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 0.68 to1.31; P < 0.037). Similar results were observed for baseline cases of IS. Stratification by sex confirmed an allelic association with IS in women, whereas no association was observed in men. CONCLUSIONS: The A allele of the -866G>A variant of UCP2 was associated with increased risk of IS in Chinese diabetic women with type 2 diabetes in a 4-year prospective study. This association was independent of other common IS risk factors.
