 UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported that microalbuminuria is an independent risk factor for the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). For this reason, the clinical significance of DR in normoalbuminuric type 2 DM patients may be overlooked. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of DR and predictors for DR in normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 DM. METHODS: A total 310 patients with type 2 DM and normoalbuminuria, who were referred to the Department of Ophthalmology for screening of DR were included in this study. DR was clinically graded according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy guidelines. The urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) was assessed via 24-hour urine collection and measured by immunoturbidimetric assay. Normoalbuminuria was defined as a UAER < 20 μg/min in 2 out of 3 consecutive tests taken within 2-3 months. RESULTS: DR of any grade was present in 64/310 (20.7 %) patients. Mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) was most prevalent in patients with DR of any grade (36/64, 56 %). The duration of diabetes (OR 1.01, 95 % CI, 1.01 - 1.02, p < 0.001), hemoglobin levels (OR 0.73, 95 % CI, 0.59 - 0.91, p = 0.004) and a higher tertile of UAER (OR 4.04, 95 % CI, 1.71 - 9.57, p = 0.001) had independently significant association with DR. NPDR as well as PDR was more prevalent in patients with higher tertile of UAER compared with those with lower tertile of UAER (NPDR, p = 0.002 and PDR, p = 0.027, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with normoalbuminuric type 2 DM also require close monitoring for the early detection of DR, especially if they have a higher UAER, longer duration of diabetes, or lower hemoglobin levels.
