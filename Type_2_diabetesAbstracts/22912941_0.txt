 BACKGROUND: Previous studies in diverse ethnic groups have reported that progressive resistance training is effective for glycemic control. However, it is unknown whether this form of exercise therapy leads to clinically meaningful changes in metabolic, cardiovascular and anthropometric parameters in Asian Indians. AIM: The study was designed to investigate the efficacy of progressive resistance training on glycemic, musculoskeletal, anthropometric and cardiovascular variables in untrained middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients living in North India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight untrained patients, 35 men and 13 women (mean ± SD age, 44.7 ± 4.2 years), with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into 2 groups: A group receiving progressive resistance training and a control group who provided participative involvement. The primary outcomes were glycemic control and muscle strength. Additionally, anthropometric and cardiovascular risk parameters were evaluated at baseline and after intervention or control program at 8 weeks. RESULTS: Mixed ANOVA revealed a significant group-by-time interaction for the main outcomes of the study. Change in glycosylated hemoglobin was mean ± SD, 0.6 ± 0.5 in progressive resistance training group compared to no change in control group (P < .001). Progressive resistance training group showed a greater improvement in upper and lower body muscle strength (P < .001), waist circumference (P = .008), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .004). However, no significant group-by-time interaction was detected on body weight, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term progressive resistance training program leads to clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control and muscle strength in untrained middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients of Asian Indian ethnicity.
