High risk of vascular complications in diabetes foundation gave the American Heart Association ranked diabetes to diseases of the cardiovascular system. More than 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes life expectancy will be reduced by the development of their coronary artery disease, diabetes was an independent factor that increases the risk of myocardial infarction (2-3 times), stroke (more than 2 times) independently of other known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and acute coronary events are characterized by the extremely serious nature against the background of pronounced coronary atherosclerosis. In the present study, a comparative assessment of the frequency of coronary vessels of different severity in patients with myocardial infarction in the presence of diabetes and without. Status of the coronary vessels were studied by means of selective coronary angiography. The study found that in patients with myocardial infarction in combination with type 2 diabetes is much more frequent multivessel disease and coronary delay the passage of contrast material than patients with MI without diabetes. These features and characteristics of coronary lesions in patients with diabetes and myocardial infarction may explain why more severe myocardial infarction with frequent development of coronary events in these patients. After analyzing the data obtained, it can be assumed relationship progression of vascular lesions with concomitant coronary glycemic decompensation.
