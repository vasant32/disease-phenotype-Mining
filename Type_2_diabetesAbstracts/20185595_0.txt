 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit an excessive cardiovascular risk and regularly receive heparin. We tested whether antibodies to the platelet factor 4-heparin complex (PF4-H-AB) contribute to outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In 1255 hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes, the German Diabetes Dialysis Study evaluated the effect of atorvastatin (20 mg/d) versus placebo. In a post hoc analysis, the association among PF4-H-ABs, biochemistry, and prespecified, centrally adjudicated end points (combined cardiovascular end point [CVE], all-cause mortality, sudden death, myocardial infarction, stroke) was investigated. RESULTS: During 4 years, 460 patients reached the CVE; 605 died, 159 of sudden death. Myocardial infarction and stroke occurred in 199 and 97 patients, respectively. Positive PF4-H-AB status was found in 231 (18.7%) of 1236 tested patients and was associated with lower albumin, higher C-reactive protein, and arrhythmia. In a multivariate model adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and biochemistry, PF4-H-ABs were associated with sudden death. No significant association between PF4-H-ABs and all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or the CVE was observed. Detecting an interaction between acetylsalicylic acid and PF4-H-ABs regarding sudden death and mortality, we found that the association between PF4-H-ABs and outcomes was restricted to patients with acetylsalicylic acid use, most likely because of indication bias. CONCLUSIONS: In hemodialysis patients who have type 2 diabetes and are treated with acetylsalicylic acid, PF4-H-ABs are associated with sudden and all-cause death. Further studies are needed to elucidate this association.
