Control of blood glucose levels and restoration of pancreatic islet function are among the goals of physicians seeking to improve outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A growing body of evidence supports the use of incretins to achieve these goals, and current guidelines recommend earlier and more frequent use of these agents. However, in patients with T2DM, treatment paradigms should always be individualized. The author discusses issues for physicians to consider when adjusting T2DM therapy, including patient comorbidities, glucose control patterns, and potential adverse effects. The importance of patient education and practical points for initiating a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist are also reviewed.
