 OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that replacement of sucrose with isomaltulose in sweet foods and beverages improves metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred ten patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive sweet foods containing either 50 g/day isomaltulose or sucrose for 12 weeks as part of their habitual diet under free-living conditions. HbA(1c) at 12 weeks was the primary outcome parameter. RESULTS: In the final analysis comprising 101 patients, isomaltulose did not significantly affect HbA(1c) at 12 weeks (sucrose: 7.39 ± 0.78%; isomaltulose: 7.24 ± 0.76%; regression coefficient [b]: 0.02 [95% CI: -0.21 to 0.25], P = 0.844). Triglycerides at 12 weeks were significantly lower in the isomaltulose versus the sucrose group (b: 34.01 [6.59-61.44], P = 0.016). Other secondary parameters did not significantly differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Isomaltulose did not influence glycemic control assessed as HbA(1c) in type 2 diabetes under free-living conditions but was associated with lower triglyceride levels.
