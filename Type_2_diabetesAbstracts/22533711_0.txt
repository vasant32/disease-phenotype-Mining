Background: The failure of therapy with oral hypoglycemic drugs leads to not only poorly regulated glycemic status, but also dyslipidemia and increased body weight and body mass index (BMI). Sulfonylureas act as insulin secretagogues by binding to the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR-1) encoded by the gene ABCC8. The aim of this study was to explore whether there is an association of ABCC8 polymorphisms SUR1 exon 16 (-3C/T), SUR-1 exon 31 (Arg1273Arg), and SUR-1 exon 33 (S1369A) with lipid concentration and BMI in type 2 diabetics on sulfonylurea therapy. Materials and Methods: This study included 251 unrelated type 2 diabetics on sulfonylurea therapy. Height and weight were measured for BMI calculation. All polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods. Lipid concentrations and BMI were measured at inclusion into the study and after 6 months of follow-up. Results: Wild-type allele carriers for the SUR-1 exon 31 polymorphism (Arg1273Arg) had a significantly higher triglyceride (TG) concentration when compared with the carriers of two variant alleles (p=0.023). Polymorphic allele carriers of the SUR-1 exon 16 (-3C/T) polymorphism were more frequent in the subgroup of patients with the TG concentration increase after 6 months (p for genotype and allelic differences: 0.024 and 0.015, respectively). Conclusion: ABCC8 polymorphisms in exon 16 and 31 are associated with the TG concentration in type 2 diabetics on sulfonylurea therapy.
