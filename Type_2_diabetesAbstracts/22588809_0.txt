 OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationships of resistin concentrations with body mass index (BMI), body fat mass, lean body mass, and body protein mass in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine,  King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from April 2008 to March 2011. A total of 229 subjects were selected for the study. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analyzer. Parameters recorded included BMI, waist hip ratio (WHR), total body water, fat, protein, and lean body masses. Blood samples were analyzed for glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and resistin levels. RESULTS: We found that BMI, WHR, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and resistin levels were significantly higher in diabetics compared to non-diabetic healthy individuals. Fat mass was significantly higher in diabetic patients compared with controls, while the difference for muscle mass and lean body mass was non-significant. A significant positive correlation was observed between plasma levels of resistin and fat mass in patients with DM (r=0.2824, p=0.0030). CONCLUSION: Type 2 DM patients have significantly higher resistin levels that are positively correlated with body fat mass supporting the evidence that resistin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity and insulin resistance.
