 AIMS: Data on glucose and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) according to insulin treatment status are lacking. We examined DM control, risk factors, and comorbidities among U.S. persons according to insulin treatment status. METHODS: In the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2003-2006, we examined in 10,637 adults aged â‰¥30 with type 2 DM the extent of control of A1c, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, and blood pressure (BP) and composite goal attainment by insulin use status. RESULTS: 6.6% (n=889, projected to 14.3 million) had type 2 DM; of these, 22.9% were insulin users and 57.2% were treated only by other diabetes medications. Overall, 58.2% had an A1c<7% (53 mmol/mol) (insulin users 33.1%, non-insulin treated 66.1%, and 77.9% of those not on medication, p<0.0001). Overall, 44.2% were at a BP goal of <130/80 mmHg, 43.8% had an LDL-C<100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L), and 13.9% a BMI<25 kg/m(2). Only 10.2% were simultaneously at A1c, LDL, and BP goals (5.4% of those on insulin). CONCLUSIONS: U.S. adults with type 2 DM, especially those treated with insulin remain inadequately controlled for A1c and CVD risk factors and have a high prevalence of comorbidities.
