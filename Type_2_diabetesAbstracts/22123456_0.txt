 OBJECTIVES: To investigate the key factors in and gap between perception and performance of daily blood glucose monitoring, regular exercise and diet control in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and to help develop patient-centric healthcare management strategies. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A focus group interview was conducted and questionnaires were collected from outpatients with type 2 diabetes. Paired sample t-tests, importance-performance gap analysis and regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: Perseverance was the key factor affecting blood glucose monitoring and regular exercise; the association was stronger in men than women. The critical factor in diet control was the desire to eat. Patients' perceived severity of diabetes and limited daily activities due to diabetes correlated with regular exercise, patients' compliance correlated with glucose monitoring, and perceived health status correlated with diet control. CONCLUSIONS: The cultivation of perseverance and strengthening psychological coping is critical. Health professionals should design tailored services, avoid didactic intervention education programmes, and develop a 'meaning-centred' rather than a 'message-centred' philosophy of exercise. Such a campaign may help to improve self-management and promote health behaviours for people with type 2 diabetes.
