Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is defined as abdominal central obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and hypertension. The rapid increasing prevalence of MetS and the consequent diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disorder, are becoming a global epidemic health problem. Despite considerable research into the etiology of this complex disease, the precise mechanism underlying MetS and the association of this complex disease with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and increased cardiovascular disease remains elusive. Therefore, researchers continue to actively search for new MetS treatments. Recent animal studies have indicated that the galanin peptide family of peptides may increase food intake, glucose intolerance, fat preference and the risk for obesity and dyslipidemia while decreasing insulin resistance and blood pressure, which diminishes the probability of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. To date, however, few papers have summarized the role of the galanin peptide family in modulating MetS. Through a summary of available papers and our recent studies, this study reviews the updated evidences of the effect that the galanin peptide family has on the clustering of MetS components, including obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hypertension. This line of research will further deepen our understanding of the relationship between the galanin peptide family and the mechanisms underlying MetS, which will help develop new therapeutic strategies for this complex disease.
