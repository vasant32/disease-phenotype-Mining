A 45-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes and multiple diabetic complications was diagnosed with hypoparathyroid hypercalcaemia. The bone scintigraphy showed Charcots arthropathy. Blood tests, computer tomography and mammography did not give any indication of malignancy, vitamin-D intoxication nor hyperthyroidism. Charcots arthropathy is not a recognized cause of hypoparathyroid hypercalcaemia, but the mechanism might be increased boneresorption. We recommend that Charcots arthropathy is considered a cause of hypoparathyroid hypercalcaemia in patients with diabetic neuropathy.
