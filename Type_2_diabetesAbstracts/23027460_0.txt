The influence of sex on the development of obesity, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and dyslipidemia is well documented, although the molecular mechanism underlying those differences reminds elusive. Ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are used as oral antidiabetics (PPARgamma agonists: thiazolidinediones, TZDs), or for the treatment of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases, due to their lipid-lowering properties (PPARalpha agonists: fibrates), as PPARs control transcription of a set of genes involved in the regulation of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Given a high prevalence of those metabolic disorders, and thus a broad use of PPAR agonists, the present review will discuss distinct aspects of sex-specific differences in antiobesity treatment using those groups of PPAR ligands.
