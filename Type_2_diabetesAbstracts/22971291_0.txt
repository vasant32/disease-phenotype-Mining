Our vision is that the opportunistic screening system will be improved in order to find patients with occult type 2 diabetes (T2D), since an early treatment based on a correct phenotyping is the goal. Individual goals for HbA1c, blood pressure and lipids must be set up, and the number of drugs used must fit with the patient's phenotype to avoid polypharmacy. A new flow chart for the organisation of T2D has been formulated giving the general practitioners the role as co-ordinators.
