 BACKGROUND: Cuban Americans have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, placing them at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and increased medical costs. Little is known regarding the lifestyle risk factors of CVD among Cuban Americans. This study investigated modifiable CVD risk factors of Cuban Americans with and without type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Sociodemographics, anthropometrics, blood pressure, physical activity, dietary intake, and biochemical parameters were collected and assessed for n=79 and n=80 Cuban Americans with and without type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Fourteen percent with diabetes and 24 percent without diabetes engaged in the recommended level of physical activity. Over 90 percent had over the recommended intake of saturated fats. Thirty-five percent were former or current smokers. DISCUSSION: Cuban Americans had several lifestyle factors that are likely to increase the risk of CVD. Their dietary factors were associated with blood cholesterol and body weight, which has been shown to impact on medical expenses. These findings may be used for designing programs for the prevention of CVD as well as type 2 diabetes for Cuban Americans.
