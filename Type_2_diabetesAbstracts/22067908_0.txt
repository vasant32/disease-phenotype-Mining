Type 2 diabetes is a key risk factor for ischemia-dependent pathology; therefore, a significant medical need exists to develop novel therapies that increase the formation of new vessels. We explored the therapeutic potential of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFRtk) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibition in impaired ischemia-induced neovascularization in type 2 diabetes. Unilateral femoral artery ligation was performed in diabetic (db(-)/db(-)) and their control (db(-)/db(+)) mice for 4 weeks, followed by treatments with EGFRtk and ERK1/2 inhibitors (AG1478, 10 mg/kg/day and U0126, 400 Î¼g/kg/day, respectively) for 3 weeks. Neovascularization, blood flow recovery, vascular and capillary density, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity were significantly impaired and were associated with enhanced EGFRtk and ERK1/2 activity in db(-)/db(-) mice. EGFRtk and ERK1/2 inhibitors did not have any effect in control mice, while in db(-)/db(-) mice there was a significant increase in neovascularization, blood flow recovery, vascular and capillary density, endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, and were associated with a decrease in EGFRtk and ERK1/2 activity. Our data demonstrated that the inhibition of EGFRtk and ERK1/2 restored ischemia-induced neovascularization and blood flow recovery in type 2 diabetic mice. Thus, EGFRtk and ERK1/2 could be possible targets to protect from ischemia-induced vascular pathology in type 2 diabetes.
