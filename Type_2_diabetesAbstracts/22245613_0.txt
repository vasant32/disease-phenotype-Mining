We investigated the relationship between BsmI/ApaI polymorphisms in vitamin D receptor gene and diabetic nephropathy in a Han Chinese population. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to test the genotype and allele frequency of BsmI and ApaI polymorphisms in 304 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM group) and 100 control individuals (ND group). The DM group was further divided into DN0 (no diabetic nephropathy), DN1 (diabetes with small amount of albuminuria), DN2 (diabetes with large amount of albuminuria), L/NDN (late-onset DN after 5 years/no DN over the whole follow-up period of 5 years) and EDN (early-onset diabetic nephropathy occurring within first year) subgroup. We found that (1) genotype and allele frequency of BsmI polymorphism had significant difference between DM and ND group; BB+Bb genotype and B allele frequency were significantly higher in DN2 group than in ND and DN0 group; the ApaI polymorphism and allele frequency did not show any difference between DM and ND group; (2) BsmI BB+Bb genotype and B allele frequency were significantly higher in EDN group than in L/NDN group; (3) among patients with nephropathy, albumin excretion rate (AER) in 24-hour urine was significantly higher in those with BB+Bb phenotype than in those with bb phenotype (P<0.01), (4) unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that BsmI BB+Bb genotype was not only correlated with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, but also correlated with early-onset type 2 diabetic nephropathy. We conclude that the allele B (BB or Bb genotype) in vitamin D receptor gene is correlated with large amount albuminuria in the Han Chinese population with type 2 diabetes, and is probably a risk factor for early-onset diabetic nephropathy.
