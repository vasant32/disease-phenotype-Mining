The aim of the present study is to investigate the antidiabetic properties of oligosaccharides of Ophiopogonis japonicus (OOJ) in experimental type 2 diabetic rats. OOJ was administered orally in doses of 225 and 450Â mg/kg body weight to high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetic rats for 3 weeks. The results showed that OOJ treatment could increase body weight, decrease organ relative weights of liver and kidney, reduce fasting blood glucose level, improve oral glucose tolerance in diabetic rats. Moreover, increased glycogen content in liver and skeletal muscle, reduced urinary protein excretion, higher hepatic GCK enzyme activity, lower hepatic PEPCK enzyme activity, enhanced GLP-1 level, decreased glucagon level and alleviated histopathological changes of pancrea occurred in OOJ-treated diabetic rats by comparison with untreated diabetic rats. This study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, that OOJ exerts remarkable antidiabetic effect in experimental type 2 diabetes mellitus, thus justifying its traditional usage.
