Evidence has been presented recently that type 2 diabetes patients have an increased level of DNA damage. This DNA damage could be associated with oxidative, inflammatory, and endothelial biomarkers and could represent a possible indication of injury in the endothelium and induction of inflammation in type 2 diabetes. To confirm this possible association, DNA strand breakage was evaluated by use of the comet assay and its association with oxidative, inflammatory, and endothelial biomarkers in type 2 diabetes patients. A case-control study (30 healthy controls and 32 subjects with type 2 diabetes) was performed to evaluate the association between DNA damage and NOx (nitrate/nitrite), interleukin-6 (IL-6), urinary albumin, fasting glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels. Type 2 diabetes patients presented higher DNA damage than control subjects, higher levels of IL-6 and urinary albumin, and lower NOx. Significant correlations between DNA damage and NOx (r=-0.303, p=0.016), IL-6 (r=0.845, p<0.001), urinary albumin (r=0.496, p<0.001), fasting glucose (r=0.449, p<0.001), and HbA(1c) (r=0.575, p<0.001) were reported. Our findings showed an increase of DNA damage in type 2 diabetes especially in those patients with poor glycemic control and associations among NOx, IL-6 and urinary albumin levels with DNA damage.
