AIMS: To investigate whether long-term mortality or clinical outcomes differed between patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and presenting with HbA(1c) within or above normal range at time of diagnosis. METHODS: Data were from a population-based sample of 1136 individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis was confirmed with a single fasting whole blood/plasma glucose â‰¥7.0/8.0mmol/l. The median time from day of diagnosis until end of follow up was 18.8years. Patients were grouped according to normal HbA(1c) and elevated HbA(1c) at diagnosis. The effect of elevated HbA(1c) on a number of clinical outcomes and all-cause mortality was assessed in Cox regression models. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 97 patients (8.5%) had an HbA(1c) level within normal range. Age (mean (SD)) at diagnosis was 64.5 (11.5) years. Both unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for the effect of HbA(1c) on mortality and other outcomes were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus by means of elevated fasting whole blood/plasma glucose but have HbA(1c) within reference range at diagnosis do not seem to have a relatively benign long-term clinical course. Therefore new diagnostic procedures should preferably be able to identify these individuals.
