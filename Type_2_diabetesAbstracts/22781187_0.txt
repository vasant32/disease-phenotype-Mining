In recent decades, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in China has increased significantly, underscoring the importance of investigating the etiological mechanisms, including genetic determinants, of the disease in Chinese populations. Numerous loci conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been identified worldwide, with most having been identified in European populations. In terms of ethnic heterogeneity in pathogenesis as well as disease predisposition, it is imperative to explore the specific genetic architecture of T2D in Han Chinese. Replication studies of European-derived susceptibility loci have been performed, validating 11 of 32 loci in Chinese populations. Genetic investigations into heritable traits related to glucose metabolism are expected to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of T2D, and such studies have already inferred some new susceptibility loci. Other than replication studies of European-derived loci, efforts have been made to identify specific susceptibility loci in Chinese populations using methods such as genome-wide association studies. These efforts have identified additional new loci for the disease. Genetic studies can facilitate the prediction of risk for T2D and also promote individualized anti-diabetic treatment. Despite many advances in the field of risk prediction and pharmacogenetics, the pace of clinical application of these findings is rather slow. As a result, more studies into the practical utility of these findings remain necessary.
