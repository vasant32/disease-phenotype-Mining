BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) seems to play an important role in the development of diabetes mellitus (DM)-associated periodontitis; however, some aspects of this issue are still scarcely known, such as the expression of AGEs in type 1 DM-associated periodontitis and the clinical factors able to affect their accumulation. This study aimed to clarify these points by evaluating the expression of AGEs in DM-associated periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen systemically and periodontally healthy subjects and 48 subjects suffering from generalized, severe, chronic periodontitis (16 with type 1 DM, 16 with type 2 DM and 16 systemically healthy subjects) were studied clinically, periodontally and metabolically. The immunohistochemical expression of AGEs in gingival tissues was also evaluated. RESULTS: Subjects affected with type 1 DM presented a significantly higher percentage of AGE-positive cells than did subjects affected with type 2 DM, not only in the epithelium, but also in vessels and fibroblasts. A positive and significant correlation was found between gingival expression of AGEs and length of time affected with DM both in type 1 and type 2 DM; glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile, body mass index and age did not correlate significantly with gingival AGEs in any of the classes of subjects studied. CONCLUSIONS: Gingival AGEs are increased in both type 1 and type 2 DM-associated periodontitis; however, the clinical parameter that determines their accumulation, and therefore their degree of influence on the development of DM-associated periodontitis, may be the duration of DM.
