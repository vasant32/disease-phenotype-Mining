Diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases globally and in the United States. Although preventable, type 2 diabetes accounts for 90Â % of all cases of diabetes worldwide and continues to be a source of increased disability, lost productivity, mortality, and amplified health-care costs. Proper disease management is crucial for achieving better diabetes-related outcomes. Evidence suggests that higher levels of social support are associated with improved clinical outcomes, reduced psychosocial symptomatology, and the adaptation of beneficial lifestyle activities; however, the role of social support in diabetes management is not well understood. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the impact of social support on outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes.
