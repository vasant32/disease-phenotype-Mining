BACKGROUND: The present study was undertaken to determine whether there were changes evident in axonal membrane function prior to the onset of neuropathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: From a cohort of 110 consecutive referrals, nerve excitability was investigated in 40 diabetic patients without clinical evidence of neuropathy (20 type 1: 20 type 2). Groups were matched for gender, disease duration and HbA1c. Studies were also undertaken in two control groups, younger controls and older controls, matched for age and gender with the diabetic cohorts. RESULTS: Subjects with type 1 diabetes demonstrated significant nerve excitability abnormalities when compared to younger normal controls. Specifically, type 1 subjects showed a significant reduction multiple time points in both depolarising and hyperpolarising threshold electrotonus. Additionally, the relative refractory period was prolonged (type 1 3.19 ms: younger normal controls 3.0 ms; p < 0.05) and superexcitability was reduced (type 1 -23.12%: younger normal controls -26.37%; p < 0.05), consistent with axonal membrane depolarisation. Correlations were identified in type 1 patients between disease duration and nerve excitability parameters, including the relative refractory period (r = -0.533, p < 0.05). In contrast, only minor non-specific changes were noted in the type 2 group. DISCUSSION: This study provides clear evidence of altered axonal function in type 1 diabetic patients in the absence of clinical neuropathy. These findings suggest that altered axonal membrane potential may precede neuropathy onset in type 1 diabetes, and as such may indicate a window of opportunity to intervene and potentially reverse axonal membrane dysfunction before the development of irreversible neuropathy.
