 OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes represents a major cardiovascular risk factor. However, few studies have addressed the impact of the disease duration on mortality. Thus, we aimed to investigate the predictive value of diabetes duration for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects undergoing coronary angiography. METHODS: We studied 2455 participants of the LUdwigshafen RIsk and Cardiovascular health study (1768 males/687 females). They had a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 63.1 ± 9.0 years (range: 40.0-79.9) and a mean ± SD body mass index of 27.7 ± 4.0 kg/m(2). 704 subjects were newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes according to the 2010 criteria of the American Diabetes Association and 446 subjects had a known history of type 2 diabetes. The mean ± SD duration of the follow-up for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was 7.4 ± 2.3 years. RESULTS: A total of 543 deaths occurred during the follow-up. Among these, 343 were accounted for by cardiovascular diseases. The duration of type 2 diabetes was strongly and positively correlated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (both P<0.001). The multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for cardiovascular mortality compared to subjects without diabetes were 1.76 (1.34-2.32), 2.86 (2.00-4.08), 2.96 (1.85-4.74), and 4.55 (3.24-6.39) for subjects with new onset type 2 diabetes and subjects with known type 2 diabetes (duration ≤ 5, >5 and ≤ 10, >10 years), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The data emphasise the need to consider the diabetes duration for the prediction of mortality in subjects at intermediate to high cardiovascular risk.
