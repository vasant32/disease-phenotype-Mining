Diminished vascular endothelial function results in decreased vasodilator  capacity and is associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) in patients  afflicted with type 2 diabetes. The current study was designed to evaluate  whether daily use of sildenafil could alter endothelial function and improve  penile rigidity in a group of patients with diabetic ED. A double-blind,  placebo-controlled, prospective trial was conducted with 24 men with type 2  diabetes who were randomized into 2 groups: one receiving daily sildenafil (50  mg, n = 12) and the other placebo (n = 12) for 10 weeks. Erectile function was  captured subjectively using the International Index of Erectile Function  (IIEF-5), and endothelial function was objectively monitored via brachial  artery flow-mediated dilation. Among the placebo and sildenafil groups, there  were no significant differences in average patient age, time from type 2  diabetes diagnosis, duration of ED, or baseline IIEF-5 scores. Past medical  histories, including smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, and  hyperlipidemia, were also similar. At the conclusion of the 10-week trial,  patients who received daily sildenafil had significantly improved erectile  rigidity as captured by IIEF-5 (P < .001) and increased  endothelial function via brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (P  < .01). Endothelial function in men with type 2 diabetes was enhanced with  daily sildenafil. Improved erectile rigidity and enhanced vascular circulation  was noted after 10 weeks of daily sildenafil use.
