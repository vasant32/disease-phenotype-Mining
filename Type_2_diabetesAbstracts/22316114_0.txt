 BACKGROUND: We compared the effects of miglitol as an add-on to bolus insulin and dose-intensified bolus insulin on postprandial glycemic excursions by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The glucose levels of 21 type 2 diabetes patients admitted for glycemic control were monitored for three consecutive days by CGM after stable glycemic control was achieved with bolus or basal-bolus insulin therapy. During the 3-day period, bolus insulin administration was continued in 11 patients on Day 1; the dose of bolus insulin in these patients was increased by 2 U before each meal on day 2, and on day 3, 50 mg of miglitol was administered before each meal in addition to the initial dose of bolus insulin given on Day 1. In the remaining 10 patients, the order of administration on Day 2 and Day 3 was reversed. RESULTS: Of the glycemic fluctuations observed during the 24-h period, postprandial glycemic excursions showed a greater reduction during treatment with dose-intensified bolus insulin and during treatment with miglitol plus bolus insulin than during treatment with bolus insulin alone; however, miglitol plus bolus insulin treatment had a more potent effect than treatment with dose-intensified bolus insulin on reducing postprandial glycemic excursions immediately after meals. Changes in area under the curve (ΔAUC) occurring within 1 h and 2 h after each meal were significantly smaller during treatment with miglitol plus bolus insulin than during treatment with dose-intensified bolus insulin, whereas ΔAUC within >2 h after each meal, except dinner, was significantly greater during treatment with miglitol plus bolus insulin than during treatment with dose-intensified bolus insulin. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that miglitol as an add-on to bolus insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes may be one of the beneficial therapeutic options that provides a more rigorous postprandial glycemic control without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia before the next meal.
