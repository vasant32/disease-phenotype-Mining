To examine the presence of CD34-positive cells and intranuclear factors in acute coronary thrombi, we compared thrombi in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM, n = 21) and without DM (n = 29). Immunohistochemical staining revealed the constitutive presence of platelets, fibrin, erythrocytes, neutrophils, extracellular high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), and histone H3 in all thrombi. There were significantly more oval or flat CD34-positive cells and significantly larger HMGB-1-positive areas in the thrombi from patients with DM. The flat CD34-positive cells expressed ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (a platelet aggregation inhibitor). The number of CD34-positive cells was negatively correlated with the serum levels of glucose and hemoglobin A1c, whereas the HMGB-1-positive area was positively correlated with the levels of serum glucose. The paucity of CD34-positive cells and the high levels of HMGB-1 expression in acute coronary thrombi from patients with type 2 DM could facilitate thrombus formation.
