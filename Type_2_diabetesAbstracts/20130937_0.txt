In addition to chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance itself has been proposed to cause a diabetic neuropathy. We evaluated the role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Eighty-six patients with type 2 diabetes were evaluated for the anthropometric and biochemical profiles, and Kitt value was calculated from insulin tolerance test to assess the insulin resistance. Various autonomic function tests, nerve conduction velocity, and quantitative sensory tests were performed to assess autonomic and peripheral neuropathy. In univariate analysis, both autonomic and peripheral neuropathy were significantly associated with glycemic exposure index (GE index), HDL-cholesterol, duration of DM, and Kitt value. In stepwise linear regression analysis, GE index was an independent predictor of autonomic and peripheral neuropathy (β = 0.643, P < 0.001; β = 0.207, P = 0.013, respectively), and Kitt value was also an independent factor for the autonomic and peripheral neuropathy (β = - 0.306, P < 0.001; β = - 0.329, P < 0.001, respectively). Low HDL-cholesterol increased the odds ratio for peripheral neuropathy. Insulin resistance is independently associated with peripheral and autonomic neuropathy in Korean Type 2 diabetic patients along with hyperglycemia and HDL-cholesterol.
