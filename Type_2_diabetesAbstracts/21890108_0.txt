 OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between glycemic subsets and clinical periodontal conditions in type 2 diabetic Brazilians with generalized chronic periodontitis. DESIGN: Ninety-one Brazilians with type 2 DM and generalized chronic periodontitis were involved in this study. The clinical examination included full-mouth assessment of plaque index (PI), bleeding on probing (BoP), probing depth (PD), suppuration (SUP), clinical attachment level (CAL) and number of remaining teeth. Blood analyses were carried out for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). The relationship between the extent of periodontitis, defined as the percentage of sites with PD and CAL≥5 mm, and glycemic parameters were also analysed. In addition, clinical parameters were compared amongst four (HbA1c levels ≤7.5%, 7.6-9%, 9.1-11% and >11%) and two (<9% and ≥9%) glycemic subsets. RESULTS: The frequency of uncontrolled diabetic subjects (HbA1c>7.5%) was higher than well-controlled subjects (HbA1c≤7.5%). Amongst the clinical parameters evaluated, only PI was positively correlated with the levels of HbA1c and FPG (p<0.05). The number of remaining teeth was negatively associated with the levels of HbA1c (p<0.05). In addition, PI was significantly higher in subjects presenting HbA1c levels >11% and ≥9% than those with HbA1c levels ≤7.5% and <9%, respectively (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Although an increased frequency of the subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis included presented type 2 uncontrolled DM, a dose-response relationship between the severity and extension of periodontitis and the glycemic control was not established in these subjects.
