Type 2 diabetes results when insulin secretion is unable to keep the plasma glucose levels as per acceptable range. This leads to chronic hyperglycemia and its associated microvascular complications such as renal impairment (diabetic nephropathy), retinal abnormalities (diabetic retinopathy), and autonomic, sensory, and motor neuropathies (diabetic neuropathy) and macrovascular disease. Historically, type 2 diabetes is well known as an adult-onset disease; however, lately, the incidence of the disease is reported to be increasing in children. Despite the wealth of information concerning type 2 diabetes in adults, data unique to the pediatric age group regarding the pathophysiology and therapy for type 2 diabetes are limited. For treatment in pediatric type 2 diabetes, metformin and insulin are the only antidiabetic agents approved currently. There are data of use of other oral antidiabetic drugs including glimepiride, rosiglitazone, and glyburide (in combination with metformin) in pediatric patients; however, formal clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy have not been conducted. This review will compare the clinical pharmacology aspects of the oral type 2 diabetic drugs in pediatric and adult populations in order to determine any differences between the two patient groups.
