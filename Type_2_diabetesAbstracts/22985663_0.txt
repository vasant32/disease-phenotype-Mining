In the last couple of years, the intensive conservative insulin treatment (basal-bolus regime) became more and more popular even in patients with type 2 diabetes. Using this insulin treatment, continuous patient education, co-operation between the medical team (diabetologist, dietician and diabetes-nurses) and the patient as well as the availability of modern insulins, pens and glucometers are of great importance. Clearly, the basal-bolus treatment with human insulin has advantages over the conservative (conventional) treatment with twice daily premix insulins. Moreover, the basal-bolus treatment with insulin-analogues proved to be superior in some aspects as compared to human insulins. The intensive insulin treatment (basal-bolus regime with insulin-analogues) approaches the optimal insulin substitution and, with its use the adequate correction of each element of the glucose triad (fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, HbA1c) should be considered feasible even in patients with type 2 diabetes.
