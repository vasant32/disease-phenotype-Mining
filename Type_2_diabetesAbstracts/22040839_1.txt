 OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetic patients. Severe vitamin D deficiency has been shown to predict cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the association among severe vitamin D deficiency, coronary calcium score (CCS), and asymptomatic CAD in type 2 diabetic patients with elevated urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) >30 mg/24 h. This was a cross-sectional study including 200 type 2 diabetic patients without a history of CAD. Severe vitamin D deficiency was defined as plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (p-25[OH]D3) <12.5 nmol/L. Patients with plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide >45.2 ng/L or CCS ≥400 were stratified as being high risk for CAD (n= 133). High-risk patients were examined by myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI; n = 109), computed tomography angiography (n = 20), or coronary angiography (CAG; n = 86). Patients' p-25(OH)D3 levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The median (range) vitamin D level was 36.9 (3.8-118.6) nmol/L. The prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency was 9.5% (19/200). MPI or CAG demonstrated significant CAD in 70 patients (35%). The prevalence of CCS ≥400 was 34% (68/200). Severe vitamin D deficiency was associated with CCS ≥400 (odds ratio [OR] 4.3, 95% CI [1.5-12.1], P = 0.005). This association persisted after adjusting for risk factors (4.6, 1.5-13.9, P = 0.007). Furthermore, severe vitamin D deficiency was associated with asymptomatic CAD (adjusted OR 2.9, 1.02-7.66, P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk type 2 diabetic patients with elevated UAER, low levels of vitamin D are associated with asymptomatic CAD.
