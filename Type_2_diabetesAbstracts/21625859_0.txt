Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A/B (CDKN2A/B) has been reported as a candidate gene of type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on its chromosomal position and its important role in β-cell function and regeneration. However, studies to date have reported inconsistent findings regarding the association between T2D and CDKN2A/B. To clarify this inconsistence, we conducted a meta-analysis based on alleles and genotypes prevalence of rs10811661 and rs564398 in CDKN2A/B. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline databases were systematically reviewed for studies published between January, 2006, and November, 2010. A total of 35 reports were collected, among of them only 16 studies (including 24,407 cases and 33,937 controls) match the inclusion criteria and were selected for the statistical test. In the meta-analysis of published data, our results suggest that the rs10811661 T allele (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.21-1.36, P < 1 × 10(-5)) and TT genotype (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22-1.43, P < 1 × 10(-5)) of CDKN2A/B were associated with type 2 diabetes respectively, but rs564398 was not (for allele only: OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88-1.05, P = 0.35). The association between rs10811661 T allele and T2D was observed both in Asia (P < 1 × 10(-4)) and Europe ethnicity groups (P = 0.002). This meta-analysis yielded evidence that rs10811661 of CDKN2A/B confers risk for T2D. Larger studies with mixed ethnicity subjects are required to validate our findings.
