 BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a serious and growing problem in Taiwan where it is the fifth leading cause of death, and health care costs are 4.3 times higher than for people without diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether participation in a motivational interview for people with type 2 diabetes would improve their self-management, psychological and glycemic outcomes. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of the motivational interviewing intervention. SETTINGS: Participants were drawn from the diabetes outpatient clinic of a large teaching hospital in South Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 250 type 2 diabetes people. METHODS: Type 2 diabetes people were randomly allocated into either the motivational interview group or the usual care group from baseline to 3 months follow-up. The intervention was based on motivational interviewing which encompassed a variety of interviewing techniques, and reflected each person's readiness stage to change. The control group was provided with usual care by nursing staff. RESULTS: A total of 250 type 2 diabetic participants were randomized. The retention rate in the intervention group was 83% (n=104). The motivational interview did improve participants significantly in self-management, self-efficacy, quality of life, and HbA1c among diabetes people with appropriate baseline value (<121.24, <174.57, <107.18, and >7.62, respectively) but not in depression, anxiety and stress (F=0.13, p=0.72) compared to the control group at 3 months follow-up. CONCLUSION: The findings provided important evidence concerning the positive effect of motivational interventions in self-management, psychological and glycemic outcomes. This research provided evidence for future clinical practices in diabetes care.
