 CONTEXT: The views of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients have not been considered in the debate on the role of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in the management of T2DM. OBJECTIVE: To assess the views of T2DM patients on SMBG. METHODS: Two previously trained research assistants used a structured pre-tested questionnaire to interview 416 T2DM patients practising SMBG in out-patient clinics in the privacy of the patients after they have consented to be interviewed. RESULTS: 79% of patients were unemployed with mean duration of diabetes of 11.8 ± 0.5 year. 94% of patients did not have health insurance policies while 86% did not belong to any diabetes support group. Although 70% of the patients identified SMBG as expensive, 94% believed it assists glycaemic control, while 89% thought it was worth the expense. CONCLUSION: Caribbean T2DM patients believe SMBG was beneficial for the management of their diabetes and empowering them may reduce diabetes complications.
