 AIM: To estimate the level of serum lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)] in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and to determine the relationship between Lp(a) in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and micro-vascular complications. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed that enrolled 144 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus above the age of 25 years attending outpatient clinic of Government Medical College, Kozhikode. Lp(a) levels were measured quantitatively in venous samples using Turbidimetric Immunoassay in all subjects. Each patient was evaluated for micro vascular complications, namely diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The relationship between Lp(a) levels and the micro vascular complications was assessed by univariate analysis. RESULTS: Mean age of cases was 53.93 ± 10.74 years with a male to female ratio of 1.3:1. Mean duration of diabetes was 9.53 ± 7.3 years. Abnormal Lp(a) levels (≥ 30 mg/dL) were observed in 38 (26.4%) diabetic subjects. Seventy-eight (54.16%) cases had diabetic nephropathy and significantly higher Lp(a) levels were found among these cases [Median 28.2 mg/dL (Interquartile range; IQR 24.4-33.5) vs 19.3 mg/dL (IQR 14.7-23.5); P < 0.05]. Retinopathy was present among 66 (45.13%) cases and peripheral neuropathy was detected among 54 (37.5%) cases. However, Lp(a) levels were not significantly different among those with or without retinopathy and neuropathy. Positive correlation was found between higher Lp(a) levels and duration of diabetes (r = 0.165, P < 0.05) but not with HbA1c values (r = - 0.083). CONCLUSION: Abnormal Lp(a) levels were found among 26.4% of diabetic subjects. Patients with diabetic nephropathy had higher Lp(a) levels. No association was found between Lp(a) levels and diabetic retinopathy or neuropathy. Longer duration of diabetes correlated with higher Lp(a) levels.
