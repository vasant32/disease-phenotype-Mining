 AIMS:   This paper is a report of a study into factors predicting complementary and alternative medicine use in people with type 2 diabetes. BACKGROUND:   The growing incidence of type 2 diabetes is emerging as a major health issue throughout the world. While the rate of complementary and alternative medicine use in this population is high, it is not clear what predicts its use, in this population. METHODS:   A cross-sectional survey, using a structured interview, was undertaken among people with type 2 diabetes attending diabetic clinics in three census regions in Taiwan, between July 2006 and February 2007. The survey instrument, derived from a review of Taiwanese and international literature, was developed using the Health Belief Model. RESULTS:   A total of 326 participants with type 2 diabetes were interviewed (87·4% response rate). In people with type 2 diabetes, complementary and alternative medicine use was associated with a history of its use, a positive attitude towards it, stronger health beliefs about diabetes and the efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine in treating diabetes, a higher degree of self-care activities by the individual and a longer duration of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS:   The results of this study indicate that complementary and alternative medicine use in people with type 2 diabetes is influenced by people's experience, beliefs, attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine, and their behaviour towards disease management rather than their demographic characteristics. Nurses and healthcare professionals should consider the patient's background, health history, health beliefs and cultural background when planning specific strategies designed to modify lifestyle.
