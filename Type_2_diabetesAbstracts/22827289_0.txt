Dyslipidemia is a prominent feature of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance that contributes to increased atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks under these conditions. Incretin-based therapies (GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors) have recently been developed and are approved for clinical use for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Besides improved glycemic control, other benefits are being increasingly appreciated, one of which is improved plasma lipid profile. This review aims to summarize the evidence and potential mechanism of such agents in humans in modulating fasting and postprandial lipoprotein metabolism.
