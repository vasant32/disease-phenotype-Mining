Several landmark studies have recently been published in nephrology. In summary, mycophenolate mofetil is superior to azathioprine in maintaining remission and preventing relapse in lupus nephritis. For patients with type I diabetes, long-term renal function is better preserved when optimal glycaemic control is obtained with intensive diabetes therapy from the onset of disease, and in patients with type 2 diabetes treatment with bardexolone may increase renal function. With respect to chronic kidney disease, the association of simvastatine and ezetimibe is effective in improving cardiovascular outcomes. There is no need to initiate dialysis in asymptomatic patients, and daily haemodialysis seems better than three times weekly hemodialysis. Finally, N-acetylcysteine does not prevent contrast nephropathy.
