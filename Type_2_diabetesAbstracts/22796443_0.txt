Copy number variations (CNVs) have been shown to be associated with several diseases. They can cause deviation of genotypes from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). Genetic case-control association studies in Thais revealed that genotype distribution of CAPN10 Indel19 was deviated from HWE after correction of genotyping error. Therefore, we aim to identify CNVs within CAPN10 Indel19 region. The semi-quantitative denaturating high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) method was used to detect CNVs in the region of CAPN10 Indel19 marker in cohort of 305 patients with type 2 diabetes and 250 control subjects without diabetes. CNVs in the region of CAPN10 Indel19 was successfully detected by DHPLC. After correction of genotype calling based on the status of identified CNVs, CAPN10 Indel19 genotypes were well-fitted for HWE (p>0.05). However, we did not find association between CNV genotypes and risk of type 2 diabetes in our population. CNVs in CAPN10 have been identified in Thais. These CNVs lead to deviation from HWE of CAPN10 Indel19 genotypes. After excluding identified CNVs from the analysis, CAPN10 Indel19 was associated with type 2 diabetes. The information obtained from our study would be helpful for genotyping accuracies of SNPs residing in the CNVs region.
