Arterial hypertension is commonly observed in patients with type 2 diabetes and aggravates cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Lowering blood pressure is thus a key objective in this population. However, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels to be reached remain controversial and targets should probably be adjusted according to patient's individual characteristics ("personalized medicine"). This clinical case summarizes the main arguments for selecting blood pressure targets, as far as benefits/risks ratio is concerned, in type 2 diabetic patients with a metabolic syndrome but without complications, with a nephropathy, or with coronary artery disease.
