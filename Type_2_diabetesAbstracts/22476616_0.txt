 BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure are considered to be at high risk for hypoglycaemic complications. There is a considerable uncertainty with respect to the appropriate choice of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and comorbid heart failure. Little is known about comorbidity, hypoglycaemia rates and selected pharmacotherapy in diabetic patients with heart failure in clinical practice. METHODS: DiaRegis is a prospective registry in Germany including 3,810 patients with type 2 diabetes receiving antidiabetic treatment with oral mono or oral dual combination therapy in 2009/2010. Only patients for which adjustment of pharmacotherapy (including the introduction of insulin and GLP-1 analogues) was deemed necessary were enrolled. We examined the differences in comorbidity, hypoglycaemia and choice of anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy between diabetics with and without clinical heart failure in clinical practice in Germany. RESULTS: For 3,746 patients, data on the presence of heart failure were available, median (IQR) age 65.9 (57.6-72.8) years and 46.8% were female. Patients with heart failure (n = 370; 9.9%) were older, had a higher BMI, were less physically active, and had more cardiovascular risk factors and a substantial comorbidity. Glycaemic control was comparable between groups. Of the patients with heart failure, 76.8% received metformin, 32.7% sulfonylureas, 2.2% glucosidase inhibitors, 4.3% glinides, 6.2% glitazones and 7.3% DPP-4 inhibitors at baseline before adjustment of therapy. In multivariate analyses, patients with heart failure received less metformin (odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-0.79) and sulfonylureas (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.52-0.95) but not thiazolidinediones (OR 1.22, 95%CI 0.82-1.81) or other antidiabetic drugs. Hypoglycaemia was considerably more frequent in diabetic patients with heart failure than in those without (OR 1.96, 95%CI 1.47-2.61). CONCLUSION: Patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure had a substantially increased comorbidity burden compared to patients without heart failure. They more often suffered from episodes of hypoglycaemia, especially those requiring medical assistance. The diagnosis of heart failure did not impact the choice of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. There was no differential use of thiazolidinediones despite evidence discouraging their use in patients with heart failure.
