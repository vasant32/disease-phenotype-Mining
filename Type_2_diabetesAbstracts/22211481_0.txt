 BACKGROUND:   Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (LpPLA2) is a lipoprotein-bound enzyme involved in inflammation and atherosclerosis. In a post hoc analysis of a controlled trial with atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on haemodialysis, we examined the association between baseline and change by measuring baseline LpPLA2 activity on cardiovascular events (CVE) and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS:   LpPLA2 activity was available of 1202 patients at baseline and 6 months after randomisation from 1255 patients in the German Diabetes Dialysis Study. During the 4-year follow-up, 445 patients (37%) suffered from CVE and 583 patients (49%) died. The highest quartile of LpPLA2 activity (≥615 U/L) was associated with elevated risk for CVE [HR 1·35 (1·02-1·87); P = 0·035]. This association was mainly driven by the placebo group [HR 1·51 (1·01-2·25); P = 0·046]. Receiver-operating characteristics analysis revealed that including LpPLA2 activity in an already adjusted model increased the area under the curve (AUC) for CVE from 0·586 (0·553-0·620) to 0·632 (0·599-0·664; P = 0·020) and for death from 0·704 (0·674-0·733) to 0·708 (0·679-0·737; P = 0·026). In atorvastatin-treated patients, the decrease in LpPLA2 was associated with reduced fatal risk [HR per standard deviation 0·74 (0·62-0·90); P = 0·002], an effect not seen in the placebo group. In contrast, those patients in the placebo group presenting a > 25% decrease in LpPLA2 activity (n = 33) had a more than doubled risk of dying [HR 2·48 (1·56-3·95); P < 0·001]. CONCLUSION:   LpPLA2 activity is predictive for cardiovascular outcome and total mortality. Reducing LpPLA2 by atorvastatin was associated with reduced mortality in patients with T2D on haemodialysis.
