A case study in the development of online educational material for a patient with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is presented in this paper. Analysis of an interview of a patient with T2DM was conducted and analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Emerging themes were identified and used as the basis for the development of online educational material and the online platform for hosting this material is discussed. The method presented in this paper for the development of online learning environments for one patient with T2DM is considered to be one way of developing authentic and patient-centred educational resources.
