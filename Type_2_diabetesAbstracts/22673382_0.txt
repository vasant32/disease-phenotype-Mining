A Cochrane analysis concluded that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues were effective for the improvement of glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. What is the significance for the treatment of Danish patients with type 2 diabetes? In Denmark, two drugs exist, exenatid and liraglutid, and they both reduce HbA1c with approx. 1%. Compared with sulfonylurea and insulin, the advantage of GLP-1 analogues is not only that they rarely induce hypoglycaemia, but also that body weight is reduced. On the other hand, no long-term results exist with regard to impact on the cardiovascular system, and no complete overview of possible side effects has been presented either.
