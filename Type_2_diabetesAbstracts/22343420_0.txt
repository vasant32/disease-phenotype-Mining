Inflammation, oxidative stress, and platelet activation are involved in type 2 diabetes and its complications. Soluble CD36 (sCD36) has been proposed to early identify diabetics at risk of accelerated atherothrombosis. We aimed at characterizing the platelet contribution to sCD36 in diabetes, by correlating its concentration with the extent of platelet-mediated inflammation and in vivo lipid peroxidation and investigating the effects of low-dose aspirin on these processes. A cross-sectional comparison of sCD36, soluble CD40L (sCD40L) reflecting platelet-mediated inflammation, urinary 11-dehydro-TxB(2), and 8-iso-PGF(2α), in vivo markers of platelet activation and lipid peroxidation, was performed among 200 diabetic patients (94 of them on aspirin 100mg/day) and 47 healthy controls. sCD36 levels (median [IQR]: 0.72 [0.31-1.47] vs 0.26 [0.2-0.37], P=0.003) and urinary 11-dehydro-TxB(2) levels (666 [293-1336] vs 279 [160-396], P≤0.0001) were significantly higher in diabetic patients not on aspirin (n=106) than in healthy subjects. These variables were significantly lower in aspirin-treated diabetics than untreated patients (P<0.0001). Among patients not on aspirin, those with long-standing diabetes (>1 year) had significantly higher sCD36 levels in comparison to patients with diabetes duration <1 year (1.01 [0.62-1.86] vs 0.44 [0.22-1.21], P=0.001). sCD36 linearly correlated with sCD40L (rho=0.447; P=0.0001). On multiple regression analysis, 11-dehydro-TxB(2) (β=0.360; SEM=0.0001, P=0.001), 8-iso-PGF(2α) (β=0.469; SEM=0.0001, P<0.0001), and diabetes duration (β=0.244; SEM=0.207, P=0.017) independently predicted sCD36 levels. sCD36, platelet activation, inflammation, and oxidative stress are increased in type 2 diabetes. Future studies are needed to elucidate if the incomplete down-regulation of sCD36 by low-dose aspirin implies that sCD36 may be derived from tissues other than platelets or if additional antiplatelet strategies in diabetes are necessary to interrupt CD36-dependent platelet activation.
