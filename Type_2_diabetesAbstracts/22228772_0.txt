Gender differences in cardiovascular outcomes were compared in asymptomatic men and women with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics (DIAD) study. Of 1123 participants, 290 men and 271 women were randomised to screening with stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI); 311 men and 251 women were randomised to no screening. Follow-up was 4.8Â±0.9 years for the occurrence of cardiac events (CE; cardiac death or non-fatal myocardial infarction). The frequency of abnormal screening was similar in men (24%) and women (19%), (p=0.2), although women trended to have smaller MPI abnormalities. CE rates were lower in women than men (1.7% vs. 3.8%, p=0.04). No CEs occurred in 17 high-risk (UKPDS risk engine) women, whereas 14 (11.2%) occurred in 125 high-risk men. Asymptomatic women with T2DM have significantly better cardiac outcomes than their male counterparts and represent a subgroup for which screening for coronary artery disease does not appear warranted.
