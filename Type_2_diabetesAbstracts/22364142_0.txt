Because of the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, basal insulin alone may not be able to provide sufficient glycemic control over the long term, and thus insulin regimens will typically need to be intensified--especially for controlling postprandial glucose excursions. In patients with type 2 diabetes requiring more intensive intervention, insulin analog premix formulations can offer a simple, effective, and convenient option for tighter management of hyperglycemia in lieu of a traditional basal-bolus regimen.
