 PURPOSE: To review the early diagnosis and early effective treatment of type 2 diabetes and its role in reducing the risk of complications. This article discusses the diagnosis of T2D and the initial stages of disease management with oral monotherapy. DATA SOURCES: Extensive literature review of textbooks and clinical, medical, and nursing journals. CONCLUSIONS: There are clear evidence-based recommendations for disease management in the early stages of T2D, with therapy focusing on implementation of lifestyle changes and use of pharmacologic monotherapy. A vital part of early T2D treatment is patient education, which can lay the foundation for treatment throughout the disease continuum. The lifestyle changes recommended for management of T2D can be difficult for patients to sustain, and treatment regimens are often complex. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive disease, associated with a long-term risk of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is important that treatment is individualized, and that ongoing support is provided to maximize the possibility of achieving treatment goals. Current standards for T2D treatment are designed for a patient-centered treatment approach managed by team of healthcare practitioners, in which the nurse practitioner (NP) is central.
