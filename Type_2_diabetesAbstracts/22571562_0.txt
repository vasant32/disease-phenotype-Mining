There is accumulating evidence showing a relationship between psoriasis and an increased risk of developing cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes mellitus type 2 and ischemic heart disease. Our aim was to investigate if there is any difference in the diabetes risk profile among psoriatic patients based on clinical findings. To test this, we carried out a prospective and descriptive hospital-based study. Our results suggest that the highest risk of suffering from diabetes mellitus type 2 among psoriatic patients is in patients suffering from non-familial and late-onset disease and in patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis.
