Introduction: We present data from the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2008-2009 on the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D] status and type 2 diabetes in a representative sample of the adult Korean population. Methods: This study was based on data obtained from the KNHANES 2008-2009, which was conducted for 3 years (2007-2009) using a rolling sampling design that involved a complex, stratified, multistage, probability-cluster survey of a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population of South Korea. Results: We showed that serum 25(OH)D concentration is inversely associated with type 2 diabetes in the Korean general population. In particular, low serum 25(OH)D concentration was associated with an increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes in young women and old men. The present study showed that 25(OH)D has a significant negative association with fasting insulin and insulin resistance. Conclusion: The age- and gender-specific association between low 25(OH)D level and type 2 diabetes may be related to interactions between vitamin D, sex hormone concentrations, and type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, we showed that low 25(OH)D concentration is associated with type 2 diabetes in the Korean general population in an age- and gender-specific pattern.
