Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the major health problems of the elderly. Developed countries face an epidemic of Type 2 DM. Healthcare providers should be aware of the frequent coexistence of psychiatric conditions in elderly patients with DM. Dementia, depression, and anxiety are commonly seen in addition to other psychiatric conditions. The relationship between diabetes and psychiatric disorders is complex. Evidence suggests that common mechanisms may play a role in both the pathogenesis of DM and several psychiatric illnesses. Possible mechanisms, diagnosis, and management options are reviewed and discussed. Common mechanisms of psychiatric illness involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin resistance, and inflammatory cytokines are throwing new light that these psychiatric illnesses could be due to the complications of Type 2 DM. Periodic screening should be done in DM patients to identify the psychiatric complications. Healthcare professionals should routinely screen for psychiatric complications of DM in addition to the microvascular and macrovascular complications of DM. It is important to screen all diabetic elderly patients for mental health issues as these may interfere with self-care and the overall management of DM. Recognition and management of psychiatric disorders will help to optimize the diabetes management. Good diabetes control can also reduce the mental health complications in these patients.
