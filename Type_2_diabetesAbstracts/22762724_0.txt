INTRODUCTION: Dysregulation of metabolic pathways, caused by imbalances in energy homeostasis, leads to type 2 diabetes characterized by high glucose concentration in the blood due to insulin resistance which is a major disorder in developed countries. AREAS COVERED: One of the recent treatment strategies is using activators of SIRT1, which has been in clinical trials. Many of the cellular processes including insulin secretion, cell cycle, and apoptosis are imperatively regulated by a family of mediators called sirtuins. First known mammalian sirtuin, SIRT1 is a positive regulator of insulin secretion, which triggers glucose uptake and utilization. Since the past decade, a major outstanding question is whether SIRT1 activation is a safe therapy for human diseases such as type 2 diabetes? This review summarizes and discusses the advances of the past decade and the challenges that will brazen out perplexity about homeostasis and metabolic pathways linked to SIRT1 and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, we described the interlink between SIRT1 metabolic pathways of various tissues such as pancreas, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver. EXPERT OPINION: However be the complexity of the pathways involved, T2DM regulated by SIRT1 affected metabolism is dropping down progressively due to profound research. In the context of interlinking all the SIRT1 pathways in T2DM we found various crucial intermediaries in metabolic tissues, which can also be targeted for future prospects.
