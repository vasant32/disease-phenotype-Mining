Several environmental and genetic factors are believed to influence the onset of diabetes and its complications. It has also been established that cytokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have revealed that the polymorphism at the stromal-derived factor 1β (SDF-1β) 3'A regulates the expression of SDF-1 (CXCL12). This study was aimed to explore this polymorphism in parallel with SDF-1 serum levels in type 2 diabetic patients. In this assessment, peripheral blood samples were collected from 200 type 2 diabetic patients and 200 healthy controls. DNA was extracted, and a PCR-RFLP screening was applied to examine the SDF-1β 3'A polymorphism. We also applied the ELISA technique to measure serum levels of SDF-1. Our results showed that there were no significant correlations between SDF-1β 3'Α polymorphism in type 2 diabetic patients when compared to controls. However, our results showed that the serum levels of SDF-1 were significantly increased in the patients when compared to controls. Based on the results of this study, we concluded that SDF-1β 3'Α polymorphism does not play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes but that elevated serum levels of SDF-1 may be important for the etiology of type 2 diabetes but are unrelated to the SDF-1β 3'Α polymorphism.
