A chemical investigation of plant Satureja hortensis L. - garden savory (GS) has been carried out. It is established that the GS is rich in phenolic compounds. Flavonoids apigenin, luteolin, cinaroside, luteolin-glucuronide, luteolin-rutinoside, isoroifolin and phenylcarbonic acids - chlorogenic acid and rosmarinic acid were isolated from the leaves of the plant. The total content of flavonoids and phenylcarbonic acids in GS is 1,6-1,7%. The leaves of GS contain up to 1% essential oil consisting mainly of thymol and methyl carvacrol. Dry aqueous extract of GS leaves, which retains the full range of substances of raw plant material has been obtained. Pharmacological investigation of the GS extract was carried out on intact animals and animals with experimental alloxan diabetes. Antidiabetic Arfasetine was chosen as a reference drug. The study revealed that the GS extract exhibits hypoglycemic activity significantly reducing blood sugar levels and is safe in the long run. Drug dosage form named saturin - capsules containing 0,33 g of dried aqueous extract of GS leaves, has been developed. Clinical trials of Saturin confirmed its effiacy in diabetes mellitus type 2. The drug is registered by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Welfare of Georgia (Registration Certificate â„–003658) and approved for use in type 2 diabetes either independently or in combination with other hypoglycemic agents. Saturin is manufactured at the Experimental and Production Facility of the Institute of Pharmacochemistry.
