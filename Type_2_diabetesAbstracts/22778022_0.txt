 BACKGROUND: The co-occurrence of schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been well documented. Recent genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses have shown robust associations of the solute carrier family 30 member 8 (SLC30A8) gene variants with T2DM in various populations. We examined the involvement of the SLC30A8 in the susceptibility to schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population. METHODS: The SLC30A8 rs13266634 gene polymorphism was genotyped in 837 chronic schizophrenic and 1109 unrelated healthy controls by using a case control design. We also assessed clinical symptoms. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the rs13266634 genotype (χ(2)  = 1.95, df = 2, p = 0.38) and allele (χ(2)  = 0.47, df = 1, p = 0.50) distributions between the patient and control groups. There was no association between rs13266634 and clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: The SLC30A8 gene variation does not appear to contribute a genetic basis for the co-occurrence of schizophrenia and T2DM.
