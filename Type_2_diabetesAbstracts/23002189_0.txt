BACKGROUND: Metabolic alterations and endothelial dysfunction are interrelated processes in type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that often develop in parallel. We assessed the association of vasoactive precursor peptides (VPPs) with MetS and type 2 diabetes. DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma levels of pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET-1) and proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) were measured by novel sensitive assays in 1590 participants of the population-based KORA F4 study. The association of the VPPs with type 2 diabetes, MetS defined by IDF criteria, the components of MetS, and insulin resistance (IR) was assessed in logistic regression models. RESULTS: Elevated levels of CT-proET1 and MR-proADM were associated with type 2 diabetes, MetS and insulin resistance (IR) in age-sex adjusted models. After adjustment for age, sex, former vascular complications, lifestyle factors, hsCRP and serum creatinine significant associations with MetS were found for MR-proADM (OR=5.94 95%-CI 3.78-9.33) and CT-proET-1 (OR=5.18, 95%-CI 3.48-7.71) (top quartile versus bottom quartile). MR-proADM and CT-proET-1 were strongly associated with all components of MetS as defined by IDF criteria. After multivariable adjustment, association of MR-proADM and CT-proET-1 with pathological glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes disappeared and a borderline association with IR was found only for CT-proET1 (OR=1.34, 95%-CI: 0.96-1.87). CONCLUSIONS: We here demonstrate for the first time that plasma levels of CT-proET-1 and MR-proADM are both related to MetS and its components, thus suggesting that they possibly have a role as surrogate biomarker for the disease and its complications.
