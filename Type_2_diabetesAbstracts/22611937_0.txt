 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of L-arabinose on glucose and Organ and islet in type 2 diabetic rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fed high-sugar and high-fat diet after 8 weeks, then inject streptozotocin intraperitoneally according to 25 mg/kgbw dose to establish animal models of type 2 diabetes, and fed L-arabinose according to a low dose (50 mg/kgbw ), medium dose (150 mg/kgbw) and high dose (500 mg/kgbw) ,the animal be fed acarbose (20 mg/kgbw) as a positive control, the use of L-arabinose and acarbose were prepared in the dextrin (0.36 g/ml) and sucrose (0.04 g/ml) of the suspension, free to eat water. OGTT after 4 weeks, After animal death, rat liver, epididymal fat and cecum were weighed and calculate the ratio of organ weight. Results compared with model group, low, animals with L-arabinose-intervention those blood glucose response had a significant impact, 30 min, 60 min, 120 min blood glucose values and AUC were significantly lower than the model group (P < 0.05), of which medium dose is most significant (P < 0.01). L-arabinose intervention increased cecal weight and showed protective effect on beta-cell. CONCLUSION: L-arabinose long-term intervention can improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetic rats, this effect may be related to L-arabinose inhibition of digestive enzymes and the protective effect on beta-cell.
