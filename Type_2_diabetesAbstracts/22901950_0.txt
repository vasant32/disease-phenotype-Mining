Purpose of the Review: The purpose of this review is to understand new modalities available to treat and manage type 1 and type 2 diabetes during pregnancy. Recent Findings: The use of new insulin analogs and oral agents, as well as new technologies to deliver insulin and monitor glucose during pregnancy remains controversial. This review will outline the advantages and disadvantages, as well as the safety profiles of these new medications and therapeutic options. Summary: There are many effective treatments for diabetes during pregnancy. New insulin analogs seem to be safe to use in pregnancy and offer the potential for better glycemic control compared with older agents. Oral hypoglycemic medications also seem to be safe and may be an option for a select group of pregnant patients with type 2 diabetes. Insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems may be beneficial in certain patients, but adequate data are not yet available in terms of outcomes and cost-effectiveness to support widespread use. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After participating in this CME activity, physicians should be better able to revise glycemic goals for pregnant patients with pregestational diabetes to be in line with our current understanding of glycemic profiles in normal pregnant women. Use new insulin analogs to treat pregnant women with abnormalities in glucose homeostasis and choose which patients will benefit from advanced technologies for diabetes management, such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring systems.
