OBJECTIVETo examine, for the first time, the association between a novel inflammatory cytokine, angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) 2, and the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSA total of 2,164 community-dwelling Japanese individuals aged 40 to 79 years without diabetes were followed up for 7 years. Serum ANGPTL2 levels were divided into quartile categories at baseline: <2.15, 2.16-2.71, 2.72-3.40, and â‰¥3.41 ng/mL. During follow-up, 221 participants developed T2DM.RESULTSIn multivariate analyses, after adjusting for comprehensive risk factors and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, the risk of developing T2DM was significantly higher in the highest ANGPTL2 quartile than in the lowest quartile (hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.14-2.85; P = 0.01).CONCLUSIONSElevated serum ANGPTL2 levels were positively associated with the development of T2DM in a general population, independent of other risk factors including hs-CRP levels.
