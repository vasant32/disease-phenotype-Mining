Observations on the association between the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene polymorphism and nephropathy have been inconsistent, which might be due to ethnic and geographical variations. Furthermore, the relationship between +405 G/C polymorphism and albuminuria in the diabetic population has not been sufficiently studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate for the first time the possible association between +405 G/C polymorphism and albuminuria in an population from Tehran of Iran. A total of 255 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (Group A) and 235 patients with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria (Group B) were included. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) were used to detect the VEGF alleles. In univariate analysis, the groups were statistically similar in all variables except for HbA1c (8.53 ± 1.7 in Group A vs. 8.2 ± 1.73 in Group B; P = 0.034), 24-h urinary albumin (201.33 ± 84.8 in Group A vs. 22.88 ± 3.5 in Group B; P < 0.001), and the frequency of GG genotype (31% in Group A vs. 18.7% in Group B; P = 0.006). The GG genotype was the independent predictor of albuminuria [P = 0.014, OR = 1.771, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.124-2.790]. Our study showed that the G allele was not associated with albuminuria, but the GG genotype in the VEGF gene is independently associated with development of nephropathy in the our diabetic population.
