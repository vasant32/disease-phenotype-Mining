 AIM: This study evaluated the effect of sitagliptin versus glibenclamide on arterial stiffness, blood pressure, lipid profile, oxidative stress, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty diabetes patients, inadequately controlled on metformin, were randomly assigned to either sitagliptin (100 mg/day) or glibenclamide (5 mg/day) for 3 months. Following a 1-month washout period, a crossover switch from glibenclamide to sitagliptin and vice versa was performed for an additional 3 months. Arterial stiffness, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, lipids, hsCRP, glycated hemoglobin, fasting glucose, STAT-8-isoprostane (a measure of oxidative stress), body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference were measured at baseline and at 3 months with each of the study drugs. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients completed the study. Glibenclamide had a better glucose-lowering effect than sitagliptin, but this was associated with more hypoglycemic events. BMI increased following glibenclamide treatment, whereas sitagliptin proved weight-neutral. Mean BMI gain was +0.5±1.0 kg/m(2) for glibenclamide versus -0.01±0.9 kg/m(2) for sitagliptin (P<0.001). Triglyceride levels significantly dropped following sitagliptin, although they remained unaltered after glibenclamide treatment. Mean triglyceride decrease was -18.4±45 mg/mL after sitagliptin but -0.2±57 mg/dL following glibenclamide treatment (P=0.018). There was no change in low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, arterial stiffness, blood pressure monitoring, hsCRP, or STAT-8-isoprostane with each of the study drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin, but not glibenclamide, demonstrated a significant beneficial effect on BMI and triglyceride levels. However, arterial stiffness, blood pressure, oxidative stress, and inflammatory status were not significantly affected by adding sitagliptin or glibenclamide to metformin-treated type 2 diabetes patients.
