 BACKGROUND: The treatment goals recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus include hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) <7.0%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) <100 mg/dL, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) <130 mmHg. Only 10% of conventionally treated patients reach these goals as a composite endpoint. The efficacy of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in meeting this composite endpoint has not been reported. METHODS: We compared our database of patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing RYGB to a database of patients with medically managed type 2 diabetes and at least 2 years of follow-up data. RESULTS: Ultimately, 152 RYGB patients were compared to 115 routine medical management (RMM) patients for whom data on the composite endpoint were available over 2 years. The results show significant decrease in body mass index (kilograms per square meter) in the RYGB group compared to the RMM group (P < 0.001). HbA1C, LDL cholesterol, and SBP all significantly improved in the RYGB group (all P ≤ 0.01) and did not demonstrate any significant change in the RMM group. Over 2 years, when evaluating all three endpoints, the RYGB group (10.5% to 38.2%, P < 0.001) demonstrated increased achievement of the ADA goals compared to the RMM group (13.9% to 17.4%, P = 0.47). There was a significant decrease in medication use in the RYGB cohort; however, discontinuation of medications was sometimes inappropriate. CONCLUSIONS: RYGB achieves the ADA composite endpoint more frequently than conventional therapy and with less medication.
