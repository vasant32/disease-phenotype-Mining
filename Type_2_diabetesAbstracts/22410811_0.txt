 OBJECTIVE: To determine tissue factor procoagulant activity (TF-PCA) in patients with type 1 diabetes and to examine effects of hyperglycemia and hyperglycemia plus hyperinsulinemia on TF-PCA. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We have determined circulating TF-PCA and other coagulation factors under basal (hyperglycemic) conditions, after acute correction of hyperglycemia, in response to 24 h of selective hyperglycemia, and in response to 24 h of hyperglycemia plus hyperinsulinemia in nine type 1 diabetic patients and in seven nondiabetic control subjects. RESULTS: As shown previously in patients with type 2 diabetes, basal TF-PCA and plasma coagulation factor VIIa (FVIIa) were higher in patients with type 1 diabetes than in nondiabetic control subjects. However, in contrast with type 2 diabetes, normalizing glucose did not decrease the elevated TF-PCA levels, and raising glucose or glucose plus insulin levels did not increase TF-PCA. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 1 diabetes have elevated circulating TF-PCA and FVIIa levels and are in a procoagulant state that may predispose them to acute cardiovascular events. The mechanisms regulating TF-PCA in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are different and should be further explored.
