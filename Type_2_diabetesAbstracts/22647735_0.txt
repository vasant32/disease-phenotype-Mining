OBJECTIVES: Circulating levels of YKL-40 and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to evaluate YKL-40 levels in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) with and without secondary diabetes mellitus (DM) to investigate whether elevated plasma YKL-40 could play a primary role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes or rather represent a consequence of the diabetic state. METHODS: Plasma levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test in 8 patients with CP and secondary DM, 8 patients with CP and normal glucose tolerance (NGT), and 8 healthy control subjects (CTRLs). RESULTS: Plasma YKL-40 and IL-6 were significantly higher in patients with CP and secondary DM (YKL-40, mean [95% confidence interval], 113 [60-215 ng/mL]; IL-6, 4.6 [2.3-9.1 pg/mL]) compared to patients with CP and NGT (YKL-40, 42 [28-63 ng/mL]; IL-6, 1.4 [0.8-2.4 pg/mL]) and healthy control subjects (YKL-40, 46 [31-69 ng/mL]; IL-6, 1.4 [0.8-2.4 pg/mL]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CP and secondary DM have elevated levels of YKL-40 and IL-6 compared to CP patients with NGT and healthy subjects, suggesting that YKL-40 is not a primary mediator of DM but a consequence of the diabetic state.
