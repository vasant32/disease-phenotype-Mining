The Spontaneously Diabetic Torii-Lepr (fa) (SDT-fa/fa) rat is a new model of obese type 2 diabetes. The SDT-fa/fa rat shows obesity and hyperglycemia at a young age compared to the Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT-+/+) rat; however, bone abnormalities in the SDT-fa/fa rat have not been investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of obese type 2 diabetes on bone turnover, bone mass, and bone strength in the SDT-fa/fa rat. Sprague-Dawley rats were used as control animals, and SDT-+/+ rats were used as non-obese type 2 diabetic rats. Serum osteocalcin and urine deoxypyridinoline levels were decreased in SDT-fa/fa rats compared to control rats at a young age. SDT-fa/fa rats showed decreases in bone mineral density and bone mineral content of the whole tibia, and shortening of the tibia and femur compared to control and SDT-+/+ rats. Deterioration in bone geometrical properties of the femur midshaft such as cortical thickness and minimum moment of inertia, was observed in SDT-fa/fa rats compared to control and SDT-+/+ rats. Furthermore, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur was decreased in SDT-fa/fa rats compared to control rats. These negative effects on bone in SDT-fa/fa rats caused severe decreases in maximum load, stiffness, and energy absorption of the femur. In addition, serum levels of homocysteine, a candidate for bone fragility markers, were elevated in SDT-fa/fa rats compared to control and SDT-+/+ rats. In conclusion, the SDT-fa/fa rat may be a useful model to investigate bone abnormalities in obese type 2 diabetes.
