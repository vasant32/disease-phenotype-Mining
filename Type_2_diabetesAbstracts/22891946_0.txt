OBJECTIVES: Apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) is an anti-atherogenic and anti-oxidative plasma glycoprotein involved in reverse cholesterol transport. The aim of this study was to examine the association between apoA-IV and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular endpoints and parameters of protein-energy wasting and nutrition in haemodialysis patients. METHODS: This post hoc analysis was performed in the German Diabetes Dialysis Study (4D Study) evaluating atorvastatin in 1255 haemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus followed for a median of 4 years. The association between apoA-IV and relevant outcomes was analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Body mass index (BMI) was used as a marker of protein-energy wasting. Additionally, a definition of extended wasting was applied, combining median values of BMI, serum albumin, creatinine and sensitive C-reactive protein, to classify patients. RESULTS: Mean (±SD) apoA-IV concentration was 49.8±14.2 mg/dL. Age- and sex-adjusted apoA-IV concentrations were strongly associated with the presence of congestive heart failure at baseline [odds ratio=0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.88 per 10 mg/dL increase; P<0.001). During the prospective follow-up, the strongest association was found for all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR)=0.89, 95% CI 0.85-0.95, P=0.001), which was mainly due to patients with BMI >23 kg/m² (HR=0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.94, P<0.001) and those in the non-wasting group according to the extended definition (HR=0.89, 95% CI 0.84-0.96, P=0.001). This association remained significant after additionally adjusting for parameters associated with apoA-IV at baseline. Further associations were observed for sudden cardiac death. ApoA-IV was less strongly associated with atherogenic events such as myocardial infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Low apoA-IV levels seem to be a risk predictor of all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death. This association might be modified by nutritional status. © 2012 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.
