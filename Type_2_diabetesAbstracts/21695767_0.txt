 BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been shown to result in medical complications on several organ systems including the kidneys, eyes, cardiovascular system, and most recently described the brain, including the hippocampus. There is also evidence that females are disproportionately affected by these medical complications. Brain volume reductions have also been associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and dyslipidaemia. This study investigated the relationships among T2DM, gender, inflammation, dyslipidaemia, and hippocampal volumes. METHOD: Participant groups consisted of 40 obese adults with T2DM and 47 lean adults, group-matched on age, gender, race, and education. Each participant underwent medical examination including a standard panel of blood tests, a magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive evaluation. RESULTS: We show that there is a gender difference in the association of T2DM and hippocampal volumes: diabetic women are most affected despite having better glucose control than their male counterparts. Although females with T2DM had disproportionately lower high density lipoprotein as well as better haemoglobin A1c, neither of these results explained why females with T2DM had the smallest hippocampal volumes. CONCLUSIONS: These important findings indicate that in addition to the higher rate of traditional medical complication, females with T2DM are likely to suffer more brain complications than males. These observations, if supported by larger studies, suggest that in the future gender could be considered when customizing diabetes treatment.
