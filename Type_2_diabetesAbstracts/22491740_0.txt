 BACKGROUND: In normal platelets, insulin inhibits agonist-induced Ca(2+) mobilization by raising cyclic AMP. Platelet from patients with type 2 diabetes are resistant to insulin and show increased Ca(2+) mobilization, aggregation and procoagulant activity. We searched for the cause of this insulin resistance. DESIGN AND METHODS: Platelets, the megakaryocytic cell line CHRF-288-11 and primary megakaryocytes were incubated with adipokines and with plasma from individuals with a disturbed adipokine profile. Thrombin-induced Ca(2+) mobilization and signaling through the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 were measured. Abnormalities induced by adipokines were compared with abnormalities found in platelets from patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Resistin, leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and retinol binding protein 4 left platelets unchanged but induced insulin resistance in CHRF-288-11 cells. Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-Î± and visfatin had no effect. These results were confirmed in primary megakaryocytes. Contact with adipokines for 2 hours disturbed insulin receptor substrate 1 Ser(307)-phosphorylation, while contact for 72 hours caused insulin receptor substrate 1 degradation. Plasma with a disturbed adipokine profile also made CHRF-288-11 cells insulin-resistant. Platelets from patients with type 2 diabetes showed decreased insulin receptor substrate 1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Adipokines resistin, leptin, plasminogen activator-1 and retinol binding protein 4 disturb insulin receptor substrate 1 activity and expression in megakaryocytes. This might be a cause of the insulin resistance observed in platelets from patients with type 2 diabetes.
