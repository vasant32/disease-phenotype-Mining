 BACKGROUND: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is regarded as one of the most important regulatory systems for cardiovascular homeostasis. In this study, we investigated associations of the five genetic polymorphisms in the RAS and presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. We used the generalised multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) method to identify gene-gene interactions. RESULTS: The D allele in the ACE gene was significantly more frequent in type 2 diabetic patients with CAD (p = 0.04). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the DD genotype was associated with a significantly increased risk of CAD (p = 0.044). 1675G/A variant in the AT2R gene was found to be associated with CAD in female subjects with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.025). The three other polymorphisms of the RAS do not seem to influence the development of CAD in type 2 diabetes. No significant gene-gene interaction for any combinations of genotypes was found in the GMDR method. CONCLUSION: The DD variant of the ACE gene polymorphism is associated with increased risk of developing CAD in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. A slight impact of AT2R 1675G/A polymorphism on CAD was found only in female diabetic patients.
