 OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between sleep quality and glucose level, diabetic complications in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A total of 130 hospitalized elderly type 2 diabetes in our hospital were included in the study. Questionnaires and other related clinical data were collected within one week after admission. Patients were divided into two groups: poor-sleeper group and good-sleeper group according to Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS: Sixty percent (78/130) of these patients were poor sleepers. The following parameters differed in the two groups: the duration of diabetes [(7.9 ± 1.8) years vs (7.2 ± 1.5) years, t = 2.318], systolic blood pressure [(148 ± 30) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) vs (138 ± 23) mm Hg, t = 2.037], fasting plasma glucose (FPG) [(10.7 ± 2.2) mmol/L vs (9.8 ± 1.9) mmol/L, t = 2.410], hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) [(8.6 ± 2.2)% vs (7.8 ± 2.1)%, t = 2.068], high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) [(5.27 ± 2.34) mg/L vs (4.44 ± 1.76) mg/L, t = 2.179], ratio of diabetic complications (61% vs 32%, χ(2) = 4.257), percentage of depression (20% vs 8%, χ(2) = 3.722), score of life quality [(98 ± 19) scores vs (89 ± 13) scores, t = 2.980], and proportion of patients treated with insulin (32% vs 12%, χ(2) = 4.489). All the above parameters were significantly higher in poor-sleeper group than the good-sleeper group (all P value < 0.05). Multiple correlation analysis showed that the factors affecting sleep quality were FPG, HbA1c, duration of diabetes, diabetic complications, depression, life quality and insulin application (r = 0.213, 0.257, 0.223, 0.335, 0.422, 0.3451, 0.231, respectively; all P value < 0.05). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, the followings were found: FPG (β = 1.29, P < 0.05) and PSQI (β = 1.07, P < 0.05) were found to be correlated with HbA1c. With increasing of PSQI, FPG, HbA1c, diabetic complications and life quality were changed significantly (all P value < 0.05). The independent risk factors of diabetic complications were duration of diabetes (OR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.01 - 2.01), HbA1c (OR = 2.01, 95%CI 1.63 - 2.67), hs-CRP (OR = 1.12, 95%CI 1.08 - 1.21) and PSQI (OR = 1.71, 95%CI 1.58 - 2.02). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus are usually poor sleepers. Sleep quality probably affects blood glucose regulation, and is closely correlated with the occurrence of complications. In addition, poor sleep quality results in poor life quality.
