 OBJECTIVE: In order to explore the pathological feature in the progression of cataract with type 2 diabetes, we compared the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and vimentin in lens epithelial cells (LECs) of cataract patients with and without type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The indirect immunoperoxidase technique was performed on anterior capsules obtained from 25 patients with type 2 diabetes (DM group) and 25 patients without diabetes (control group). Immunohistochemical difference in the expression of PCNA, ICAM-1, and vimentin in LECs between the 2 groups was investigated. RESULTS: PCNA expression was decreased (P=0.036) but ICAM-1 expression was significantly increased (P<0.0001) in the DM group as compared with that in the control group. No difference was noted in the expression of vimentin between the 2 groups (P=0.264). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased proliferation of LECs and increased expression of ICAM-1 in LECs might play an important role in the progression of cataract with type 2 diabetes.
