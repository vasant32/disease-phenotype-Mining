Major depression, depressive symptoms, distress with diabetes and psychological adjustment to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are somehow overlapping constructs with shared covariance. Nevertheless, diabetes distress remains the most prevalent long-lasting factor associated with hyperglycemia in T2DM. This ought to be taken on account when treatment is planned, namely when one is looking for metabolic control and emotional distress integrative care. Temperament or other long-term individual characteristics may support the interplay of distress, psychological adjustment and depressive states in T2DM. Depressive temperament may constitute a vulnerability factor to behavioral or biological T2DM outcome or even a potential risk factor to T2DM later incidence.
