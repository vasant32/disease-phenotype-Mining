To look at the prevalence of phonatory symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The correlation between these symptoms with duration of the disease, glycemic control, and neuropathy will be described. A total of 105 consecutive patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus by their primary endocrinologist were evaluated. A control group consisting of 33 healthy subjects was recruited for this study. Demographic data included: age, gender, allergy, smoking, duration of the disease, glycemic control, and presence or absence of neuropathy. Subjects were also asked about the presence or absence of the following symptoms: hoarseness, vocal tiring or fatigue, vocal straining, and aphonia or complete loss of voice. Patients were also asked to fill out the Voice Handicap Index 10. The mean age of patients with diabetes was 53.21 + 9.68 years with male-to-female ratio of 2/3. The most common phonatory symptoms were vocal tiring or fatigue and hoarseness (34.3 and 33.3 %). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of hoarseness and vocal straining (p value 0.045 and 0.015, respectively) compared to controls. There was a significant correlation between glycemic control, neuropathy, and hoarseness (p value 0.030 and 0.001, respectively). Vocal straining and aphonia also correlated significantly with the presence of neuropathy. Close to 16 % of diabetic patients had a VHI-10 above or equal to 7. Diabetic patients are more likely to have phonatory symptoms compared to controls, namely straining and hoarseness. One out of seven patients with diabetes has reported that phonatory symptoms had a significant impact on their quality of life. The presence of neuropathy and poor glycemic control should alert the treating physician to these vocal complaints.
