Adipocytes play pivotal roles in regulating metabolism through secretion of a variety of adipokines, which in turn is regulated by other metabolic factors (e.g., insulin). Understanding the regulations of adipokine secretion is important because adipokines are implicated with metabolic disorders, such as, obesity and diabetes mellitus. Here, we investigated the regulatory roles of angiotensin II (AngII) on the secretion of apelin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and distinct signaling pathways mediated by AngII receptor type 1 (AT₁) and type 2 (AT₂) were revealed. It was found that activation of AT₁ receptors stimulates apelin secretion in Ca²⁺, protein kinase C, and MAPK kinase dependent ways while activation of AT₂ receptors inhibits apelin secretion through cAMP and cGMP dependent pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of apelin receptor (APJ) is also similarly regulated by AT₁ and AT₂ receptors. Finally, a detailed AngII signaling map is proposed.
