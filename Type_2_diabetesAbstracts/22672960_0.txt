The management of type 2 diabetes continues to evolve as new data emerge. Although glycaemic control is still important, other risk factors - such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and obesity - must also be addressed in order to reduce the long-term risks of cardiovascular complications and mortality. In this context, targeting the incretin system, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in particular, has generated much interest. GLP-1 is released from the gut in response to food ingestion and plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis. GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the heart and vasculature, prompting evaluation of their physiological role and pharmacological stimulation, both in healthy and disease states. These studies indicate that GLP-1 and GLP-1-based therapies appear to have direct, beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, in addition to their glucose-lowering properties, such as modulation of blood pressure, endothelial function, and myocardial contractility. Intriguingly, some of these effects appear to be independent of GLP-1 receptor signalling. Data from clinical studies of the GLP-1 receptor agonists, exenatide and liraglutide on cardiovascular risk factors, in patients with type 2 diabetes are also promising and the results from prospective studies to assess cardiovascular outcomes are eagerly awaited.
