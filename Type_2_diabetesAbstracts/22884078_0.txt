Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a mature procedure in treating patients with coronary artery diseases. We report a patient undergoing CABG had history of esophageal cancer and multiple underlying diseases: hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. A CABG with midline sternotomy was safely performed in the presence of thyroid replacement therapy and intensive control of blood pressure and blood glucose. The patient recovered postoperatively with supportive care.
