 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis are at high cardiovascular risk. Lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins reduces the incidence rate of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. In contrast, two randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled trials have been completed in hemodialysis patients that showed no significant effects of statins on cardiovascular outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A post hoc analysis was conducted of the 4D (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyze) study to investigate whether LDL-cholesterol at baseline is predictive of cardiovascular events and whether the effect of atorvastatin on clinical outcomes depends on LDL-cholesterol at baseline. RESULTS: High concentrations of LDL-cholesterol by tendency increased the risks of cardiac endpoints and all-cause mortality. Concordantly, atorvastatin significantly reduced the rates of adverse outcomes in the highest quartile of LDL-cholesterol (â‰¥145 mg/dl, 3.76 mmol/L). The hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 0.69 (0.48 to 1.00) for the composite primary endpoint, 0.58 (0.34 to 0.99) for cardiac death, 0.48 (0.25 to 0.94) for sudden cardiac death, 0.62 (0.33 to 1.17) for nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.68 (0.47 to 0.98) for all cardiac events combined, and 0.72 (0.52 to 0.99) for death from all causes, respectively. No such decrease was seen in any of the other quartiles of LDL-cholesterol at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis, atorvastatin significantly reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiac events and death from any cause if pretreatment LDL-cholesterol is >145 mg/dl (3.76 mmol/L).
