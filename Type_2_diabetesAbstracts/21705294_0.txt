 AIMS: To determine whether pioglitazone 30 mg daily reduces levels of ADMA in adult patients with diabetes, and whether there is improvement in markers of oxidative stress. METHODS: Prospective randomized cross-over placebo-controlled study of 36 adults age 40-75 years with type 2 diabetes recruited from a single academic health center. Intervention was for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week wash-out period, followed by a second 12-week cross-over treatment period. The main outcome was comparison of the change in ADMA levels in the two treatment periods. Secondary outcomes included change in NOx and F2-isoprostanes. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled in the study, 31 completed the protocol; the study enrollment met the sample size required to detect a change of 18% in levels. There were no differences in ADMA, NOx and F2-isoprostanes levels in the two treatment periods. Non-study medication changes or changes in dose were infrequent, and a statin was added during the study period in only one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Despite previous animal data that showed an effect of pioglitazone on ADMA, the current study in human patients did not demonstrate any differences in ADMA, NOx, or F2-isoprostane levels. The results do not favor that pioglitazone has a significant impact on ADMA levels in human patients with diabetes.
