Abstract Background: This study investigated the incidence of β-cell dysfunction and the clinical and biochemical factors affecting that in patients with type 2 diabetes having more than 3 years of follow-up. Subjects and Methods: β-Cell dysfunction was assessed by measuring changes in the fasting serum C-peptide concentrations. Patients were classified into two groups: cases showing a decreased (Group D) or an unchanged or increased (Group I) C-peptide concentration from the baseline. Results: Of the 504 patients included in this study, 259 (51%) showed decreased C-peptide concentrations, of whom 20% showed a decrease of ≥50%. Most patients, however, had a final C-peptide concentration of ≥1 ng/mL, with only 18 (4%) individuals having a level <0.6 ng/mL. Patients in Group D had a longer duration of diabetes, higher initial hemoglobin A1c concentration, and longer treatment durations with sulfonylurea and insulin compared with Group I. After adjusting for diabetes duration and C-peptide follow-up period, the duration of sulfonylurea treatment was found to be the only factor independently associated with decreases in the C-peptide concentration. Conclusions: Although β-cell function deteriorates over time in patients with type 2 diabetes, these cases mainly have fasting serum C-peptide concentrations of ≥1 ng/mL. A longer treatment duration with sulfonylurea is associated with a more rapid decline in the C-peptide concentration.
