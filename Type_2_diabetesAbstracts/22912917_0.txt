Inflammation induces insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia due to elevation of serum cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-Î± and interleukins. Chronic myeloproliferative diseases including myelofibrosis show higher serum interleukin levels than healthy subjects, which has been suggested to be the useful markers for disease activity. However, an association between myelofibrosis and insulin resistance has not ever been discussed anywhere. Here we report a case of type 2 diabetes showing remarkable hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance possibly due to myelofibrosis.
