 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence and associated factors of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with type 2 diabetes in the diabetes clinic at Chandrubeksa Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A cross-sectional study was performed on 261 type 2 diabetic patients at Chandrubeksa Hospital on January 2011. They all underwent fundus examination by ophthalmologists using indirect ophthalmoscope to check for any signs of DR. RESULTS: Retinopathy was presented in 67 (25.70%) patients who were categorized into non-proliferative and proliferative types, 23.4% and 2.3% respectively. The patients who received insulin treatment were more likely to have DR than those who had not (OR 3.95, 95% CI 1.86, 8.39). Those who had had diabetes for more than 5 years were more likely to have diabetic retinopathy than those with diabetes for a lesser amount of time (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.28, 4.33). CONCLUSION: Insulin treatment and the duration of diabetes are the significant associated factors for developing diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients. The authors emphasize the necessity of regular eye check-ups which can provide the patients with early detection so that treatment can begin before much damage occurs.
