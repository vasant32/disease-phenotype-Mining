Incretin based therapies have been introduced into the treatment options of type 2 diabetes a few years ago. Among them, the orally active DPP-4 inhibitors have established themselves as insulinotropic agents. Their advantage is the glucose-dependent insulinotropic action without an intrinsic risk for causing hypoglycemia. Additionally DPP-4 inhibitors have a glucose dependent glucagonostatic action contributing to improved glucose control. They are weight neutral and show a good safety and tolerability profile with comparable efficacy to sulfonylureas. Linagliptin is a novel DPP-4 inhibitor with a distinct pharmacological profile. In contrast to the other approved DPP-4 inhibitors it is eliminated by a hepatic/biliary route rather than a renal route. Therefore no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes and renal impairment. In clinical studies, it has been shown to be non-inferior to sulfonylurea treatment regarding glycemic parameters, but to possess favourable safety advantages regarding hypoglycemia frequency, body weight development and effects on cardioavascular parameters. This article gives an overview on the pharmacology of linagliptin as well as on the clinical data available.
