Metabolic diseases are associated with activation of the innate immune system in various tissues and characterised by elevated inflammatory factors and the presence of immune cells. Type 2 diabetes develops when islet beta-cells are deficient in producing sufficient insulin to overcome peripheral insulin resistance. Intra-islet IL-1β activity diminishes beta-cell function and survival and governs islet inflammation. Targeting the IL-1 system with the IL-1 receptor antagonist IL1Ra improved insulin secretion, glycemia and reduced systemic inflammation in a proof of concept study with patients with type 2 diabetes. Currently, long lasting and specific IL-1β blocking antibodies are evaluated in clinical trials and this may lead to a novel cytokine-based treatment for type 2 diabetes. © 2012 The Authors.
