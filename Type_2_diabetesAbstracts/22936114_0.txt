BACKGROUND: Legume consumption has been associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the type of legume is a modifier of its effect. Two Spanish dry bean varieties-white ('Almonga') and cream ('Curruquilla')-were analyzed and used in a postprandial study in type 2 diabetics to assess glucose, insulin and triacylglycerol in blood. RESULTS: 'Curruquilla' variety had higher total galactoside (stachyose, mainly), trypsin inhibitors and lectin content than 'Almonga'. The canning liquid was discarded prior to the analysis and the bean consumption by the subjects. The canning process reduced the total α-galactoside content (>50%), practically eliminated trypsin inhibitors, and no lectin content was found. After bean consumption, maximum glucose was obtained at 60 min and was three times lower than that in bread. After bean intake, maximum insulin was produced 60 min with 'Almonga' and occurred later (90 min) with 'Curruquilla' and bread. After 'Almonga' intake, the area under the curve response of triglycerides was 14% lower compared to bread (P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: 'Almonga' and 'Curruquilla' are similar in the content of the nutritional but not in that of the antinutritional components. Both beans showed similar effects on blood glucose and insulin in type 2 diabetics and marked differences compared to those of bread in terms of magnitude and time course, but only 'Almonga' rendered a significant reduction in the triglyceridemic response.
