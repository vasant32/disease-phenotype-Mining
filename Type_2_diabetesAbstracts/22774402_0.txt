 BACKGROUND: Aspirin reduces the odds of an arterial thrombotic event in high-risk patients. However, 10%-20% of patients with an arterial thrombotic event who are treated with aspirin have a recurrent arterial thrombotic event during long-term followup. Aspirin resistance has been described in some patient populations such as those with an acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent, stent re-stenosis, and diabetes mellitus (DM). The aim of this study was to assess aspirin resistance and to compare it to the use of oral anti-diabetic drugs and insulin in patients with diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Platelet aggregation was measured after aspirin treatment in 101 diabetic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Two patient populations were included in the investigation: use of insulin (group 1) and use of oral anti-diabetic agents (OAD) (group 2) in diabetic patients. Platelet aggregation was determined using a multichannel Multiplate analyzer. Among group 1 patients, 4.7% were aspirin non-responders and among group 2 patients, 8.6% were aspirin non-responders. Statistical differences were not found between the groups (p = 0.359). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that there was no significant difference in aspirin resistance between type 2 diabetes mellitus patients on insulin treatment and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients on OAD treatment.
