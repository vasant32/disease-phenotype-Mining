 OBJECTIVE: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene, especially the common rs9939609 (A/T) SNP, are associated with body mass index (BMI), diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes and has been associated with chronic diabetic complications. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate possible associations of the scarcely investigated rs7204609 (C/T) polymorphism, as well as the rs9939609 (A/T) polymorphism, with MetS and chronic diabetic complications in type 2 diabetic patients from Southern Brazil. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 236 patients with type 2 diabetes (age: 60.0 ± 10.3 years; diabetes duration: 12.7 ± 8.2 years; 53.4% women) were genotyped for the FTO rs7204609 and rs9939609 polymorphisms (ABI PRISM 7000 Real-Time PCR System). Patients underwent clinical, laboratory, and nutritional evaluation. MetS was defined according to the 2009-Joint Interim Statement. RESULTS: Carriers of C allele of the rs7204609 polymorphism (CT/CC genotypes, n = 35) were at increased risk for the presence of MetS (odds ratio [OR] = 4.56; 95% CI: 1.04 to 19.9), elevated waist circumference (OR = 8.66; 95% CI: 1.12 to 66.7), BMI: ≥ 30 kg/m(2) (OR = 3.71; 95% CI: 1.71 to 8.02), and microalbuminuria (OR = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.88), adjusted for gender and diabetes duration (P < .05 for all models). The rs9939609 polymorphism was not associated with MetS, elevated waist circumference or BMI, or diabetic complications. Daily energy and nutrient intakes did not differ according to the presence of the polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: The C allele of the rs7204609 polymorphism in the FTO gene increased the chance for the presence of MetS, especially central obesity, and microalbuminuria, independently of energy and nutrient intakes in this sample of type 2 diabetic patients from Southern Brazil.
