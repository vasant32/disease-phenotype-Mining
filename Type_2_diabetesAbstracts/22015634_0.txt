The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-4) inactivates the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 has therapeutic effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, but its potential is limited by a short half-life, DPP-4 inhibition is a promising approach to diabetes treatment. This study examined chronic (once-a-day dosing for 8 weeks) effects of the DPP-4 inhibitor PKF-275-055 (1, 3, and 10mg/kg) on β-cell regeneration and plasma DPP-IV activity, intact GLP-1, glucose, and insulin after an oral glucose load in neonatal wistar rats injected with streptozotocin (STZ) (n2-STZ model), a recognized model of type 2 diabetes. In streptozotocin induced diabetic rats, PKF-275-055 (3, and 10mg/kg) significantly reduced glucose excursion during the oral glucose tolerance test conducted 2h and 10h after administration, with increases in plasma insulin and active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels and significantly inhibited (> 50% inhibition) plasma DPP-IV activity during both the 1st and 2nd OGTT in diabetic rats. In contrast, PKF-275-055 (1-10mg/kg) did not cause hypoglycemia in fasted normal rats. Furthermore, PKF-275-055 significantly inhibited advance glycation end product (HbA1c), HOMA-Index, gastric emptying and small intestinal transit rates, with significance at doses of 1mg/kg or higher. Immunological staining showed PKF-275-055 stimulates β-cell regeneration and reduces pancreatic cell apoptosis in diabetic treated rats. The present preclinical studies indicate that PKF-275-055 is a novel selective DPP-IV inhibitor with long-acting antidiabetic effect that might be a potential agent for type 2 diabetes.
