The 21st century has the most diabetogenic environment in human history with the number of people with diabetes worldwide increasing to 380 million by 2025. The fastest rate of increase will be in developing countries. Diabetes is now the major cause of end-stage kidney disease globally; 20%-40% of people on dialysis are diabetic. In Australia, the number of people with type 2 diabetes starting dialysis increased fivefold between 1993 and 2007. We must act now at local, national and international levels to prevent type 2 diabetes; screen for early diabetic kidney disease; increase public awareness of kidney disease; treat with medications proven to reduce kidney disease progression; and promote research into and trialling of new therapies. The problem is global yet requires local action. World Kidney Day on 11 March 2010 is a time to intensify action on diabetic kidney disease and to continue to do so until this huge but largely preventable health burden is controlled.
