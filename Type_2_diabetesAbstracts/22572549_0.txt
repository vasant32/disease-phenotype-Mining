The aim of this study was to evaluate the glyco-metabolic profile among type 2 diabetic patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). We evaluated 88 type 2 diabetic males, aged 62.78 Â± 9.26 years. We administered patients the IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function) questionnaire to assess erectile function, organ function, sexual desire, and satisfaction level during and after the sexual intercourse and the SAS (self-rating anxiety scale) and SDS (self-rating depression scale) questionnaires to evaluate anxiety and depression. We evaluated: BMI, abdominal circumference, glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), HOMA index, lipid profile, testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The IIEF questionnaire showed that in the examined sample there were 50 patients (56.8%) affected by ED, and 38 patients (43.2%) without ED. Comparing the two groups, 57.9% of patients without ED, and 70.0% of patients with ED were smokers, and the difference between the two groups was significant (p<0.05). Furthermore, 23.7% of patients without ED, and 38.0% of patients with ED had a history of chronic ischemic heart disease (p<0.05 between the two groups). Patients with ED were older, and, surprisingly, had lower levels of HbA(1c). Furthermore, patients with ED had higher levels of FPI, and lower levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. The prevalence of ED in Italian type 2 diabetic males with mean age of 62 years is about 56% and it is linked to higher levels of FPI, but lower levels of HbA(1c), free testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.
