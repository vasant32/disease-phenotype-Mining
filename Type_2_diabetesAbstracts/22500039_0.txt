The increasing prevalence of diabetes is a pressing issue in Korea. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between duration of diabetes and self-reported participation in diabetes education among diabetic patients in Korea. This study used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2005. A total of 1405 respondents older than 19 years and having diabetes were included in the analyses. The relationship between these variables was assessed using logistic regression after adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic status. The authors observed that duration of diabetes was associated with having never attended diabetes education programs (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% confidence interval = 0.93-0.96; P < .001), with the greatest risk of not attending seen in recently diagnosed patients. In addition, having lower educational attainment and living in non-Metro Seoul regions were independent factors for never attending diabetes education programs among diabetic patients in Korea. This finding suggests the need for developing effective education programs to encourage diabetic patients, particularly recently diagnosed patients, to participate. Such programs could help deliver appropriate information for diabetes management to all diabetic patients in Korea.
