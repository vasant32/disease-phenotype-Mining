Dyslipidaemia is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease in diabetes mellitus. Lipid changes associated with diabetes mellitus are attributed to increases in free fatty acid flux, secondary to insulin resistance. In the present study, we have investigated the beneficial effects of swertiamarin on dyslipidaemic conditions associated with type 2 diabetes in streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic rats. Swertiamarin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) administered once a day for 6 weeks resulted in significant (p < 0.001) reductions in serum triglycerides, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels in diabetic animals as compared with diabetic control animals. Serum fasting glucose was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased, moreover, the insulin sensitivity index was significantly (p < 0.05) increased in swertiamarin treated animals. Overall the data suggest that swertiamarin has beneficial effects on diabetic associated complications such as dyslipidaemia.
