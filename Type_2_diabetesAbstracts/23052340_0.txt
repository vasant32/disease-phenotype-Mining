Diabetic mouse models created via random mutagenesis or genetic modification are essential tools to unravel the mechanisms involved in the development of diabetes mellitus and associated diseases. Three diabetic mutant mouse lines derived from the Munich N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mouse mutagenesis project and one transgenic mouse line were analyzed with respect to diabetes-relevant clinical, pathomorphological and therapeutic aspects. An Ins2 mutation and two Gck mutations were identified as the cause of diabetes mellitus in the mutant lines. Heterozygous Ins2 and homozygous Gck mutants serve as model for permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) and heterozygous Gck mutants develop maturity onset diabetes of the young typeÂ 2. Dominant-negative glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR(dn)) transgenic mice exhibit defective postnatal islet growth, develop PNDM and progressive diabetes-associated kidney lesions. The mutant and transgenic diabetic mouse models analyzed in the study were shown to represent valuable models to study the pathogenesis of monogenic diabetes and to establish novel treatment strategies.
