 BACKGROUND: A higher increase in intracellular Na(+) via Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE) during ischemia has been reported in type 2 diabetic mouse hearts. We investigated the role of NHE in inducing changes in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) and alterations in ventricular function during ischemia-reperfusion in type 2 diabetic mouse hearts. METHODS: Hearts from male type 2 diabetic db/db (12-15 weeks old) and age-matched control db/+ mice were subjected to Langendorff perfusion and loaded with 4 Î¼M of the Ca(2+) indicator fura-2. The hearts were exposed to no-flow ischemia for 15 minutes and then reperfused. [Ca(2+)](i) was measured by monitoring fura-2 fluorescence at 500 nm (excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm), while left ventricular (LV) pressure was simultaneously measured. RESULTS: db/db hearts exhibited a lower recovery of LV developed pressure than db/+ hearts during reperfusion following ischemia. Diastolic [Ca(2+)](i) was increased to a greater level in diabetic hearts than in the control hearts during ischemia and reperfusion. Such an increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) overload during ischemia-reperfusion in diabetic hearts was markedly reduced in the presence of the NHE inhibitor cariporide. This was accompanied by a significantly improved recovery of ventricular function on reperfusion, as shown by a lower increase in diastolic pressure and increased recovery of developed pressure. CONCLUSION: NHE plays a key role in enhancing cytoplasmic Ca(2+) overload during ischemia-reperfusion and severely impairing post-ischemic cardiac function in hearts from type 2 diabetic db/db mice.
