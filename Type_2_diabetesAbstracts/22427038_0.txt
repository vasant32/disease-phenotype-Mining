Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye  disease, occurring in about 60% of type 2 diabetic patients. Other than known  clinical risk factors, the influence of genes has been suggested as part of the  development of diabetic retinopathy. We investigated the association of  Gly82Ser, 1704G/T and 2184A/G polymorphisms in the RAGE gene with retinopathy  in type 2 diabetic patients in Malaysia. Ninety-eight unrelated retinopathy  patients and 185 unrelated healthy controls from all over Malaysia were  recruited in this study. The allele and genotype frequencies of the three gene  polymorphisms were investigated using PCR-RFLP. The allele frequency of the  three polymorphisms did not differ significantly between the control and the  retinopathy group (P > 0.05). Analysis of the frequency of GA+AA, GT+TT and  AG+GG in the retinopathy group did not reveal significant differences (P >  0.05) compared to the control group. We conclude that RAGE gene Gly82Ser,  1704G/T and 2184A/G polymorphisms are not associated with retinopathy  development in the Malaysian population.
