 AIM: To explore the potential risk factors related to gastrointestinal cancer in northern China. METHODS: A total of 3314 cases of gastrointestinal cancer (esophageal, gastric, pancreatic and biliary) and 2223 controls (including healthy individuals, glioma and thyroid cancer) were analyzed by case-control study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the association between different cancers and hepatitis B surface antigen, sex, age, blood type, diabetes, or family history of cancer. RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes was significantly associated with gastric, biliary and pancreatic cancer with an OR of 2.0-3.0. Blood type B was significantly associated with esophageal cancer [odd ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-2.14] and biliary cancer (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.09-2.05). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was significantly higher in gastric, biliary and pancreatic cancers compared with other groups, with ORs ranging between 2.0 and 3.0. Family history of cancer was strongly associated with gastrointestinal compared with other cancers. CONCLUSION: Blood type B individuals are susceptible to esophageal and biliary cancer. Type 2 diabetes is significantly associated with gastric, biliary and especially pancreatic cancer.
