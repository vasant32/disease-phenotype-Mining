BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation, increasing the risk for various adverse health outcomes. PURPOSE: Our objective was to investigate the association between C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker for systemic inflammation, and lifestyle factors in a national sample of people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This study analyzed data from 1,086 men and women with diabetes, who completed the 1999-2004 NHANES. Lifestyle factors included diet quality, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and physical activity. RESULTS: Stratified logistic regression showed that for both men and women, BMI was a strong predictor of elevated CRP after adjusting for age, energy intake, race/ethnicity, medications, diabetes duration, and glycosylated hemoglobin. However, among men, but not among women, the likelihood of elevated CRP increased with lower diet quality and physical inactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Among people with type 2 diabetes, higher levels of CRP were associated with lower diet quality and physical inactivity among men, and with obesity among both men and women.
