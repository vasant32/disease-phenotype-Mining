 PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship of circulating levels of soluble form of LR11 (sLR11; also called SorLA or SORL1), with the progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Fifty-four patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were divided into 2 sex- and age-matched groups: one with PDR (n = 29) and the other with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (n = 25). The serum sLR11 levels were measured with an immunodetection system followed by chemifluorescence quantification. RESULTS: The serum sLR11 levels were higher in the PDR group than in the nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy group (5.8 ± 1.2 U vs 3.7 ± 1.3 U; P < .01). A multivariate regression analysis showed that circulating sLR11 is a factor contributing to the prediction of PDR independent of other classical risk factors, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the sensitivity and the specificity were equivalent to or more than those of other factors. Among the classical risk factors for PDR, glycosylated hemoglobin levels showed the highest correlation coefficient (P < .01) for the sLR11 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Serum sLR11 concentration may reflect the progression of PDR in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. sLR11, released from immature vascular cells and indicating the development of atherosclerosis, is expected to be a novel candidate biomarker indicating diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
