 AIM: The purpose of the study was to determine factors of ankle-brachial index (ABI) in a population of patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 370 patients (mean age 60.3±8.3 years and diabetes duration 8.6±6.2 years) with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease were enrolled in a cross sectional study during 2006-2007. Multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors of ABI, considering systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, glycemia, urea, creatinin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol. RESULTS: Peripheral arterial disease was detected in 82.35% (280 pts). Mean ABI value of 0.97±0.33, and its minimal value of 0.95±0.38 was detected in this study population. Regression analysis demonstrated that mean and minimal values of ABI were independently associated with diabetes duration (β 0.120, 95% CI -0.014, -0.001) and blood urea level (β -0.126, 95% CI -0.020, -0.002). CONCLUSION: Results might have clinical implications for patients with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease in defining those with a long diabetes duration and a higher blood urea level to have greater probability of detecting pathological ankle-brachial index.
