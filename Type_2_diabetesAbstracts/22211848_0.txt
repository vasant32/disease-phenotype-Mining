Late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) or age-associated testosterone deficiency syndrome is defined as a clinical and biochemical syndrome associated with advancing age and characterised by symptoms and a deficiency in serum testosterone levels. This condition may result in significant detriment in the quality of life and adversely affect the function of multiple organ systems. It has been suggested that sex steroid hormones may play a causal role in the development of insulin resistance and type II diabetes. This comparative study was aimed at determining the prevalence of LOH in diabetic men with erectile dysfunction and investigating the effect of testosterone replacement therapy on erectile function and on glycaemic control.
