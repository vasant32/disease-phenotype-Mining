 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesised that diabetic patients would differ from those without diabetes in regard to the handling of glucose-derived reactive metabolites, evidenced by triosephosphate intermediates (TP(INT)) and methylglyoxal (MG), irrespective of the type of diabetes, plasma glucose level or HbA(1c) value. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, erythrocytes were isolated from patients with type 1 (n = 12) and type 2 (n = 12) diabetes with varying blood glucose and HbA(1c) levels. These were then compared with erythrocytes isolated from individuals without diabetes (n = 10), with respect to MG, as determined by HPLC, and TP(INT), as determined by endpoint enzymatic assays. RESULTS: The concentrations of intracellular TP(INT) and MG were significantly elevated in erythrocytes from diabetic patients. Normalisation of either TP(INT) or MG to intracellular glucose concentration (nmol glucose/mgHb) confirmed that erythrocytes from diabetic patients accumulated more reactive metabolites than did those from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetic patients can be characterised by an increased formation of TP(INT) and MG. The 25-fold increase of MG in type 1 and the 15-fold increase in type 2 diabetes, together with a several-fold increase in TP(INT) and decreased glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity even under normal glucose conditions, imply that normalising glucose level cannot completely prevent late diabetic complications until this acquired error of metabolism has been restored.
