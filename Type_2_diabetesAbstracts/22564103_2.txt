 PURPOSE: To discuss the role of nurse practitioners (NPs) in motivating and guiding patients with type 2 diabetes to self-manage their disease, achieve their treatment goals, and have a more positive treatment experience. DATA SOURCES: Personal experience; clinical studies. CONCLUSIONS: NPs play a key role in educating patients and helping them understand the need for, and benefits of, improved diabetes control. Yet, achieving improved diabetes control goes far beyond sharing information. The NP can be pivotal in helping to motivate patients to be active players in their own diabetes management. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: NPs can improve the treatment experience of patients with diabetes by educating and motivating them to make beneficial lifestyle changes and commit to treatments tailored to their individual needs and expectations.
