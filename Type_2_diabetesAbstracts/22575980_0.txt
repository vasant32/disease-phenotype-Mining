 OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation of lipid ratios and individual lipid indexes of patients with type 2 diabetes with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)). METHODS: Samples were collected from 128 type 2 diabetic patients (aged 19-90 years; male 72, female 56). The sera were analyzed for HbA(1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). According to the HbA(1c) level, the patients were divided into three groups, group A (HbA(1c) <7%, n=31), group B (7%≤HbA(1c)≤10%, n=48), and group C (HbA(1c) >10%, n=49). The correlation of HbA(1c) with lipid ratios & individual lipid indexes were analyzed. RESULTS: With the increased level of HbA(1c), LDL-C had a significantly increasing trend (P<0.05); whereas TC went up with the increased HbA(1c), without any significant differences between three groups. There was no significant correlation between HbA(1c) and TG or HDL-C. With the increased level of HbA(1c), TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C ratios were gradually increased, with significant differences among groups (P<0.05). The lipid ratios, especially LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was more susceptible to impaired lipid metabolism in T2DM patients than individual lipid. CONCLUSIONS: LDL-C/HDL-C ratio is helpful in assessing and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease caused by impaired lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic patients.
