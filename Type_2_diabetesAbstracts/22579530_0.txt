AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the polymorphism of DDAH2 is associated with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in Korean population. METHODS: Total 605 subjects were included in this study: 403 patients with type 2 diabetes and 202 non-diabetic control subjects. The SNP rs805304 and rs2272592 in DDAH2 were analyzed. We examined the association of SNP rs805304 and rs2272592 in DDAH2 with type 2 diabetes and hypertension. RESULTS: SNP rs2272592 was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (P<0.001) while SNP rs805304 was not (P=0.716). We observed that the prevalence of the AG+GG genotypes were significantly greater than AA homozygotes in type 2 diabetes (AA vs AG+GG; OR 20.74, 95% CI 6.48-66.35, P<0.001). Significance was maintained after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, DBP and BUN (OR 21.03, 95% CI 2.83-151.14, P=0.003). Both SNP rs805304 and rs2272592 in DDAH2 were not significantly associated with hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we found that SNP rs2272592 in DDAH2 is associated with type 2 diabetes but SNP rs805304 in DDAH2 is not. DDAH2 SNP rs2272592 AG+GG genotypes are associated with genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in Korean population.
