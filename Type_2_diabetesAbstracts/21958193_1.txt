 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship of plasma fetuin-A levels with markers of bone turnover in male and female type 2 diabetic subjects. BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A, which is a serum protein produced by the liver and promotes bone mineralization, is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, whilst type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased incidence of osteoporosis or fractures. It is not known how fetuin-A levels relate to parameters of bone metabolism in type 2 diabetes. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Eighty patients with type 2 diabetes [40 men and 40 women matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and time since diagnosis of diabetes] were studied. Fetuin-A together with metabolic parameters and levels of serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (C-telopeptide), osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP), bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and sex hormones was determined in all participants. RESULTS: Fetuin-A levels did not differ significantly between male and female diabetic subjects. In a model adjusted for age, BMI, fatty liver index (FLI), time since diagnosis of diabetes, HbA(1c) , antidiabetic and lipid-lowering drug therapies, smoking, total serum protein, creatinine, gamma glutamyl-transferase, parathyroid hormone, C-reactive protein, glomerular filtration rate, and presence of micro-, cardio-, and peripheral vascular diabetic complications, fetuin-A showed a significant positive association with levels of bone ALP (r = 0路71, P = 0路006) in men. In women, fetuin-A was significantly negatively associated with C-telopeptide (r = -0路60, P = 0路03) levels. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest an independent association of fetuin-A levels with markers of bone turnover in male and female patients with type 2 diabetes. More studies are needed to determine whether fetuin-A could serve as a new marker for fracture risk or osteoporosis in type 2 diabetes and to explore its potential sexually dimorphic effects.
