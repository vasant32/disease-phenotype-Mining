Objective:  To assess misperception about the lifestyles of patients with type 2 diabetes and its effect on readiness to change. Methods:  Nine hundred and forty patients [with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration greater than 7% and a body mass index greater than 25 kg/m(2) ] from 57 general practices participated in a cross-sectional survey. Misperception of lifestyles (fruit, vegetable, and fat consumption and physical activity) and readiness to change were determined with validated questionnaires. Logistic regression analysis calculated the association of misperception with readiness to change. Results:  The response rate was 55.4%. Misperception existed for all lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, 41.5%; and consumption of fruit, 40.1%; vegetables, 69.2%; and fat, 21.6%). Misperception significantly affected the readiness to change the relevant lifestyles [odd ratios from 2.67 (1.68-4.23) to 1.80 (1.16-2.79)] except for fruit consumption. The degree of misperception varied greatly between the different lifestyle behaviors and was somewhat larger (1% to 10%) than that in the Dutch general population. Conclusions:  Patients with type 2 diabetes misperceive their lifestyle behaviors, which hinders lifestyle changes. The variations in misperception and readiness to change show that diversity should be considered in lifestyle counseling for patients with type 2 diabetes.
