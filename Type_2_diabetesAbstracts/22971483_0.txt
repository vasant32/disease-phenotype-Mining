 OBJECTIVE: To investigate relationships between serum levels of retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and clinical and metabolic variables in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A total of 513 patients (286 males/227 females) provided clinical and lifestyle data and  blood and urine samples for analysis. Patients were stratified into four quartile groups according to serum RBP4 concentrations. RESULTS: RBP4 concentration was independently associated with gender, systolic blood pressure, serum triglyceride and creatinine levels, and estimated glomerular  filtration rate (eGFR). Hypertension, dyslipidaemia, micro albuminuria and impaired eGFR (< 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) were significantly more prevalent in patients with the highest RBP4 levels than in those with the lowest levels. Increased serum RBP4 was associated with increased  risk of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, micro albuminuria and impaired eGFR after adjusting for gender, age, body mass index and duration of diabetes. CONCLUSION: Serum RBP4 may be a useful marker of overall metabolic control in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
