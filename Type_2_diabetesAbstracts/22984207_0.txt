Objective. The aim of the current study was to compare obese and nonobese type 2 diabetes patients at baseline and after participating in an existing self-management intervention (i.e., Beyond Good Intentions) on cognitive, self-care, and behavioral measures to examine whether both groups are equally prepared and able to adopt self-management approaches. Methods. A total of 94 type 2 diabetes patients were included, of whom 64 (59% male) completed the study. The final sample consisted of 27 obese (33% male) and 37 nonobese (78% male) patients. The intervention comprised one individual and four group sessions and aimed to improve self-management behavior by enhancing proactive coping skills (i.e., setting concrete goals, identifying barriers, coping with difficult situations, action planning, and progress evaluation). Cognitive (i.e., proactive coping, self-control, self-efficacy), self-care (i.e., adherence to lifestyle recommendations), and behavioral (i.e., diet, exercise) measures were assessed at baseline and after completing the intervention. Results. At baseline, obese patients reported to possess lower cognitive skills and lower adherence to lifestyle recommendations compared with nonobese patients. The intervention was effective in improving cognitive skills, self-care activities, as well as dietary and exercise behaviors. Improvements were equal for obese and nonobese patients. However, obese patients were more likely to drop out. Conclusions. Although obese type 2 diabetes patients were found to possess limited skills at baseline compared with nonobese patients, the self-management course proved to be equally effective for both groups.
