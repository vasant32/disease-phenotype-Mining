AIMS: To determine the prevalence of inadequate glycemic control and its correlates in a large multicenter survey of Venezuelan patients with diabetes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in a sample of adult patients with diabetes, attending health centers in Venezuela. Information about diabetes, current medications, complications, and diet were obtained by trained interviewers, using a standardized questionnaire. HbA(1c) was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in a central laboratory. Patients with HbA(1c) >or=7% were considered to have inadequate glycemic control. RESULTS: Overall 4075 patients were surveyed, 349(8.6%) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 3726(91.4%) with type 2 diabetes(T2D). Subjects' mean age was 58 years, and 65% were female. The prevalence of inadequate glycemic control was 76%. Poor glycemic control was more common in T1D patients (87%) than in those with T2D(75%), p<10(-4). Satisfaction with current diabetes treatment was associated with improved glycemic control among non-insulin-treated patients with T2D, but gender, multi-professional care, and participation in a diabetes education program were not. CONCLUSIONS: Despite clinical evidence supporting tight control of diabetes, few diabetic patients in Venezuela met recommended glycemic control targets. This may contribute to increased rates of diabetic complications. Our findings support the public health message of implementation of early, aggressive management of diabetes.
