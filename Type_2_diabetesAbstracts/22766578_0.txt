 AIMS: Continuous glucose measurement systems are an established tool to support diabetes therapy. Because of different technical solutions one can propose different potential limitations in daily practice. So we tried to identify the accuracy of two different devices head to head in daily routine to point out individual characteristics. METHODS: We included 24 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to wear the GlucoDay and the MiniMed continuous glucose measurement system at the same time for 48Â h. We examined the mean differences in simultaneous glucose measurements, the confidence intervals were calculated by standard methods based on the t-distribution. RESULTS: Comparison of glucose levels of both continuous glucose measurement systems showed that there was a tendency for higher glucose levels measured by the GlucoDay device. These differences were dependent on the time of the day. The absolute difference between two consecutive glucose measurements was higher for the GlucoDay system what means a somehow higher fluctuation of the GlucoDay measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in intraindividual comparison of the GlucoDay and the MiniMed continuous glucose measurement systems in type 2 diabetic patients may be taken into account when using different systems for detection of nocturnal hypoglycemia and the observation of trends used for therapeutic decisions.
