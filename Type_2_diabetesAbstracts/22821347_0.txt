Efficacy of ischemic preconditioning is decreased in animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus while the responses in humans with diabetes are contradictory. It is unknown whether attenuation is related to decreased release of a mediating humoral cardioprotective factor or reduced ability to respond in the target tissue. The aim of the present study was to investigate the release and effect of a circulating cardioprotective factor in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Blood samples were drawn from nine non-diabetic subjects, eight diabetic patients without peripheral neuropathy, and eight diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy before (control) and after a remote ischemic preconditioning (rIPC) stimulus. Blood samples were dialyzed against Krebs-Henseleit buffer and the cardioprotective effects of the dialysates were tested in rabbit hearts mounted on a Langendorff model and subjected to 30-min global ischemia and 120-min reperfusion. rIPC dialysate from non-diabetic and diabetic subjects without peripheral neuropathy reduced infarct size and improved hemodynamic recovery compared to control dialysate from non-diabetic and diabetic subjects. However, in the subgroup of diabetic patients with neuropathy the cardioprotective effect was attenuated. These findings indicate that the release mechanism involves neural pathways.
