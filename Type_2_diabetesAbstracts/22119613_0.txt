We investigated the association of CDKAL1 (rs7754840 and rs7756992) and CDKN2A/2B (rs10811661) variants with T2DM. Higher MAF of rs7754840 and rs7756992 were seen in patients, and both were associated with T2DM under additive, dominant, and recessive models. CDKAL1 rs7754840 and rs7756992, but not CDKN2A/2B rs10811661, are associated with T2DM in Lebanese.
