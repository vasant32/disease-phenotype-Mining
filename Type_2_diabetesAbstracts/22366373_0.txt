 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes are highly associated with an abnormal lipoprotein profile, which may be generated and accentuated by high cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. Given the difficulty in measuring CETP activity, the aim was to identify simple biochemical predictors of high CETP activity. DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty five subjects at risk for type 2 diabetes were classified according to the presence of MS. Lipoprotein profile, HOMA-IR and endogenous CETP activity were evaluated. RESULTS: As expected, MS patients presented higher concentration of glucose, insulin, triglycerides and non-HDL-C and lower HDL-C levels. Moreover, MS patients exhibited increased HOMA-IR and CETP activity. Employing a ROC curve for MS, high CETP activity was defined as >250%ml⁻¹ h⁻¹. The predictive variables of high CETP were non-HDL-C≥160mg/dl (OR=11.1;95%IC=3.3-38.2;p<0.001) and HOMA-IR>2.1 (OR=4.4;95%IC=1.3-14.8;p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High non-HDL-C and insulin resistance were predictors for increased CETP activity which measurement is not accessible for clinical laboratories.
