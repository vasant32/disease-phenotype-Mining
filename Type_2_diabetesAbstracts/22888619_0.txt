The distinction between diabetic nephropathy lesions and non-diabetic renal lesions is not always obvious and is often based on renal biopsy. This study evaluated the prevalence and predictors of nondiabetic renal disease in people with type 2 diabetes. The study was conducted between January 2008 and October 2010 in the nephrology department of the military hospital in Rabat. The study included 16 patients with type 2 diabetes in whom renal biopsy was indicated. Non-diabetic renal disease was found in 6 of the patients (37.5%); IgA nephropathy was the most frequent non-diabetic renal disease (half of non-diabetic renal diseases). Hypertension was significantly less frequent in the non-diabetic renal disease group than the diabetic nephropathy group (16.7% versus 80.0%, P = 0024), duration of diabetes was a shorter (4.5 versus 15.5 years, P = 0.022) and diabetic retinopathy was absent (100% versus 40%, P = 0.026). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in relation to age, sex, creatinine level, 24-hour proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and microscopic haematuria.
