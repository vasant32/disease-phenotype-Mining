The variable pathogenesis and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes emphasise the need for new antidiabetic treatments. The long acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have improved the treatment. Novel approaches include inhibitors of sodium glucose co-transporter 2, which increase renal glucose elimination, G-protein-coupled receptor agonists, which potentiate insulin and incretin hormone secretion. Proof of principle has been shown for glucagon receptor agonists, glucokinase activators and treatment with dual intestinal peptides, which all induce weight loss and improve glucose tolerance.
