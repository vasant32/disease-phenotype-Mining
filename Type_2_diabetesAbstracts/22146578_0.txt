Platelet dysfunction contributes to the increased risk of thromboischemic complications after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), particularly in type 2 diabetes. Little is known about the effects of glycemic control on platelet reactivity. We assessed adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and flow cytometric expression of P-selectin in 90 patients (56 diabetic and 34 nondiabetic patients) undergoing coronary stent implantation after administration of clopidogrel as a potential predictor of poststent complications and its relation to glycemic control. Posttreatment platelet reactivity was significantly elevated in diabetic compared with nondiabetic participants and was associated with smoking, hypercholesterolemia, overweight, and cardiovascular ischemic events. A linear relationship was found between hemoglobin A1c in diabetic patients and platelet reactivity. Both methods (standard aggregometry and P-selectin expression) used for assessment of platelet function were positively correlated. Low responsiveness to clopidogrel detected by posttreatment platelet reactivity is a risk factor for ischemic events after PCI in diabetic patients.
