Since the late 1970s, self-monitoring of blood glucose has been the standard for assessing daily glycemic control. The first continuous glucose monitor became available in 1999. Numerous clinical trials have documented the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the data supporting the use of CGM in type 2 DM patients are less substantial. This review article examines the clinical evidence for using CGM in patients with type 2 DM. An extensive literature search was performed to identify relevant studies for this review. Articles published in English from 2000 to May 2010 were identified through searches of PubMed and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases using the search terms type 2 DM and continuous glucose monitoring. Relevant references were examined for additional articles. The literature search revealed 27 original articles and reviews, 12 of which were included in this review. Five out of the 12 studies reviewed showed a decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin using CGM in patients with type 2 DM. The use of CGM in patients with type 2 DM can improve glycemic control, but other benefits include modification of diet and exercise, detection of unrecognized hypoglycemia, and identification of hyperglycemia excursions.
