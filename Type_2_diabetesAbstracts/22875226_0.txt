OBJECTIVETo determine the effect of statin use on progression of vascular calcification in type 2 diabetes (T2DM).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSProgression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and abdominal aortic artery calcification (AAC) was assessed according to the frequency of statin use in 197 participants with T2DM.RESULTSAfter adjustment for baseline CAC and other confounders, progression of CAC was significantly higher in more frequent statin users than in less frequent users (mean ± SE, 8.2 ± 0.5 mm(3) vs. 4.2 ± 1.1 mm(3); P < 0.01). AAC progression was in general not significantly increased with more frequent statin use; in a subgroup of participants initially not receiving statins, however, progression of both CAC and AAC was significantly increased in frequent statin users.CONCLUSIONMore frequent statin use is associated with accelerated coronary artery calcification in T2DM patients with advanced atherosclerosis.
