 BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed the use of new oral anti-diabetic agents in Asian populations. This study assesses the efficacy and safety of saxagliptin versus placebo in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five hundred sixty-eight drug-naïve adult patients with T2DM and glycated haemoglobin levels (HbA(1c)) of 7.0-10.0% (53-86 mmol/mol) were randomized 1 : 1 to receive saxagliptin 5 mg daily or placebo. Efficacy endpoints included changes from baseline to week 24 in HbA(1c) , fasting plasma glucose (FPG), post-prandial glucose area under the curve from 0 to 180 min (PPG AUC(0-180)), and the proportion of patients achieving HbA(1c) <7.0% (53 mmol/mol). Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were evaluated. RESULTS: Saxagliptin provided statistically significant adjusted mean decreases from baseline to week 24 compared with placebo, respectively, in HbA(1c) (-0.84% [-9 mmol/mol] versus -0.34% [-4 mmol/mol]; p < 0.0001), FPG (-0.90 versus -0.17 mmol/L; p < 0.0001), and PPG AUC(0-180) (-417 versus -235 mmol · min/L; p = 0.0010). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved a therapeutic glycaemic response (HbA(1c) <7.0% [53 mmol/mol]) with saxagliptin (45.8%) versus placebo (28.8%; p < 0.0001). The proportions of patients who experienced ≥1 AE (excluding hypoglycaemia) was 43.3% for saxagliptin and 35.6% for placebo. Few patients in either treatment group experienced an SAE (2.8%, saxagliptin; 1.4%, placebo). A low proportion of patients reported hypoglycaemic events (1.8%, saxagliptin; 0.7%, placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Saxagliptin improved glycaemic control and was well tolerated in drug-naïve Asian patients with T2DM.
