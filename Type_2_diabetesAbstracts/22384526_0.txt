 INTRODUCTION: Non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is the most common type of diabetes. Genetic factors, lipid profiles, hypertension are potential risk factors for diabetes mellitus. Adenosine binding cassette transporter proteins 1 (ABCA1) plays a role in cholesterol metabolism, especially high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol). There are multiple mechanisms by which HDL-cholesterol can be atheroprotective, it is clear that the relative activity of ABCA1 plays a major role. We aimed to investigate association of ABCA1 C69T gene polymorphism with lipid levels in Turkish type 2 diabetic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After isolation of DNA by ethanol precipitation we determined ABCA1 gene polymorphism by using polimerase chain reaction--restriction fragment lenght polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method in 107 type 2 diabetic patients and 50 healthy controls. RESULTS: We have observed that the frequency of TT genotype is significantly higher in healthy controls compared to patients (14% vs. 3%; P = 0.008). Also frequency of T allele was higher in controls than in patients (34% vs. 21%; P = 0.020; OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.30-0.88)). There was no association of lipid levels and ABCA1 C69T polymorphism subgroups. CONCLUSION: We have found significantly higher frequency of both T allele and genotype in control group when compared to patients that made us think that T allele may be a protective factor against diabetes mellitus. But, we could not find a relationship between genotypes and lipid concentrations in our two groups. Larger studies will help us to understand the relationship between ABCA1 C69T genotype and lipid parameters in diabetes mellitus.
