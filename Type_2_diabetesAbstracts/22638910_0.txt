OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to explore sleep quality as a potential mediator between depression symptoms and diabetes quality of life (DQOL), and anxiety symptoms and DQOL. METHOD: Participants were 83 male and 3 female veterans with type 2 diabetes (M(age) = 62.4). Self-report measures were completed during the baseline assessment of a larger intervention study conducted at the VA Boston Healthcare System. RESULTS: Depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep quality were all associated with DQOL. Additionally, sleep quality had a partial indirect effect on the relationships between depression symptoms and DQOL, and between anxiety symptoms and DQOL. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that sleep quality may have an important role in the way that psychological distress affects diabetes quality of life. Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Clin.
