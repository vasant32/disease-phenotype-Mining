 AIMS: The progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and other long-term cardiometabolic risks in Chinese women with prior history of gestational diabetes (GD) was studied at 15 years postpartum. METHODS: 139 Chinese women (45 with GD and 94 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at the index pregnancy) who had their insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell functions examined at 8 years postpartum were again followed up at 15 years for the investigation of the rate of type 2 DM, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: Women with prior history of GD had a significantly higher rate of hypertension (35.6% vs. 16.0%, p = 0.01), type 2 DM (24.4% vs. 5.3%, p < 0.001) and impaired glucose regulation (26.6% vs. 14.9%, p < 0.001) than women with NGT during the index pregnancy. The Matsuda insulin sensitivity index and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index at 8 years postpartum were independent predictors of both DM and metabolic syndrome at 15 years postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: The conversion rate of type 2 DM increased at an average rate of 1.6% per year after a pregnancy affected by GD. Insulin resistance at 8 years postpartum could refine a future diabetic risk in women with prior history of GD.
