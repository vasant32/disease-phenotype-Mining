Abstract   Introduction: Sleep deficits associated with sleep apnea and insomnia increase the risk of vascular inflammation and insulin resistance. This study examined the hypothesis that inflammation markers are higher in those diabetic patients who experience sleep deficits compared with those without any history of a sleep disorder.   Methods: Fasting blood was obtained after written informed consent, and sleep disorder histories were obtained from type 2 diabetic patients (n=81) attending clinics of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center.   Results: There was a significant correlation between body weight and leptin, and leptin in turn was significantly correlated with 10-kDa interferon-Î³-induced protein (IP-10) levels and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients. Fasting blood levels of leptin, IP-10, and insulin resistance were significantly elevated in patients with sleep deficits compared with diabetics with normal sleep patterns. There were no differences in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) or fasting glucose in patients with sleep deficits compared with those with normal sleep patterns. Sleep deficits increase circulating levels of leptin, IP-10, and insulin resistance compared to levels seen in patients with diabetes who reported no difficulty with sleep. Patients with sleep apnea had significantly lower hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) levels compared with patients with normal sleep patterns or patients with insomnia. Low levels of circulating H(2)S could contribute to higher vascular inflammation in patients with sleep apnea.   Conclusions: These results suggest that sleep apnea is associated with a decrease in circulating H(2)S and sleep disorders increase the risk of inflammation and insulin resistance, which can contribute to the increased risk of vascular disease in subjects with type 2 diabetes.
