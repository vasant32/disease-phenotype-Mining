 INTRODUCTION: To examine the efficacy of sitagliptin and miglitol when added to ongoing insulin treatment in a patient with type 2 diabetes who had undergone partial gastrectomy. METHODS: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was performed and either sitagliptin or miglitol, or both, were added to fixed-dose insulin therapy. Blood was drawn at 0, 30, 60, and 120Â min after breakfast, and C-peptide, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) were measured. RESULTS: CGM showed that compared to insulin alone, the addition of either sitagliptin or miglitol, or both, to insulin achieved better glucose control. Compared to insulin alone, early postprandial increments in plasma C-peptide levels and suppressed glucagon levels were observed when sitagliptin was added. Glucagon suppression was even more prominent when both sitagliptin and miglitol were added. Compared to insulin alone, GLP-1 levels were higher during the early postprandial stage when sitagliptin or miglitol was added and even higher when both were added. GIP levels decreased when sitagliptin or miglitol, or both, were added to insulin therapy. CONCLUSION: The authors showed that the addition of sitagliptin or miglitol, or both, was effective in this insulin-treated patient with diabetes who had undergone gastrectomy.
