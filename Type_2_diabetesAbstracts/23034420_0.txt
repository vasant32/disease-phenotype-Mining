Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic potential of one-stage, full-mouth, ultrasonic debridement (FMUD) as a treatment for type 2 diabetic patients with generalized severe chronic periodontitis. Method and Materials: Sixteen patients diagnosed with generalized severe chronic periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus were allocated to the diabetic group; another 15 subjects with periodontitis but without metabolic disorders were placed in the nondiabetic group. Both groups were treated using the FMUD protocol, a unique 45-minute session of ultrasonic debridement of all sites presenting periodontal disease. Patients were analyzed for the following parameters: plaque and bleeding indices, gingival recession, probing depth, and clinical attachment level. Further, diabetic subjects were assessed using fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) tests. Patients were evaluated at 3 and 6 months for all parameters. ANOVA and the Tukey test were used for data analysis (P < .05). Results: Both groups showed improved periodontal health after treatment. There were no significant differences between the groups for any of the parameters assessed (P > .05). Diabetic subjects treated with FMUD had a clinical response similar to that of nondiabetic subjects at all pocket depths. No adverse effects or medical disturbances were observed in either group during treatment. FPG and HbA1c levels remained unaltered after treatment. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, FMUD promoted clinical improvements in patients with type 2 uncontrolled diabetes and generalized severe chronic periodontitis.
