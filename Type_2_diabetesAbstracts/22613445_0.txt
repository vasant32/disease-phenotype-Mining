 OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of ezetimibe, an inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption, on early phase diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: A total of 32 hypercholesterolaemic type 2 diabetes patients with microalbuminuria, defined as a urinary albumin excretion (UAE)  30 but < 300 mg/g creatinine, were enrolled. Various clinical and laboratory parameters were determined at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with 10 mg/day ezetimibe. RESULTS: Ezetimibe treatment significantly decreased glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol  (LDL-C), triglycerides and UAE, and significantly increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and albumin. It also decreased the serum level of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), but this difference was not statistically significant. Univariate analyses showed a correlation between  UAE and body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, HbA(1c), LDL-C, estimated glomerular filtration rate (inverse), creatinine and MCP-1. Since these parameters may be closely correlated with each other, multiple stepwise regression analysis was performed and demonstrated  that HbA(1c) and MCP-1 were independent determinants of UAE. CONCLUSIONS: Ezetimibe may be a promising therapeutic strategy for improving albumin excretion, partly through its anti-inflammatory properties, and for reducing LDL-C in hypercholesterolaemic type 2 diabetes patients with  microalbuminuria.
