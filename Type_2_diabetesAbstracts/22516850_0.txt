 BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that qigong therapy has physiological benefits for adults with type 2 diabetes; however, information about the psychological benefits of qigong therapy in this population is limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research project was to identify psychological responses to qigong vs control interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: The research team designed a randomized, controlled, three-arm clinical trial comparing 12 weeks of Yi Ren Medical Qigong (YRMQ), progressive resistance training (PRT), and standard care. SETTING: The study was performed at Bastyr University Research Institute, Kenmore, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 13 men and 19 women (N=32) with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, a mean age of 56.3 Â± 8.1 (standard deviation) years, glycated hemoglobin > 7.5%, and fasting blood glucose > 7 mmol/dL (126 mg/dL). INTERVENTION: For 12 weeks, participants in the YRMQ and PRT group attended a 1-hour weekly group session that a certified instructor led and were instructed to practice at least twice a week for 30 minutes. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team used the Perceived Stress Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory scores to analyze the data. RESULTS: YRMQ decreased perceived-stress scores by 29.3% (P < .05) and depression scores by 14.3% (not significant [NS]). The active control group, PRT, also decreased stress scores by 18.6% (NS) and decreased depression scores by 50% (P < .03). Stress and depression measures remained unchanged in the standard care group. CONCLUSION: YRMQ and PRT may be beneficial in reducing perceived stress and improving depression in patients with type 2 diabetes, although verification of the clinical significance of these findings requires a longer study with a larger sample size.
