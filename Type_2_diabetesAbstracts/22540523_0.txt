Objective:  To evaluate the effects of nutrition education program on cardiovascular risks among elderly with type 2 diabetes. Method:  97 elderly patients with type 2 diabetes completed this randomized controlled educational trial study. Patients were divided to intervention and control groups. BASNEF (Belief, Attitude, Subjective Norm, Enabling Factors) educational model was used to design the educational intervention. Control group received usual care during the study. Anthropometric data, lipid profiles and blood pressure measurements were collected at baseline and week 12 in each group. Results:  The intervention group showed a significant decline in body weight (-1.3±1.06 vs. 0.11±0.58 kg), body mass index (-0.48±0.37 vs. 0.05± 0.22 kg/m(2) ) and serum triglyceride levels (18.25±32.15 vs. -3.67±22.61 mg/dl) compared to the control diet (P<0.05 for all). Waist to hip ratio reduced significantly in the intervention group (P=0.03). There was no significant decline in High- density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol) (-1.02±4.35 vs. -1.10±6.93 mg/dl, P = 0.9) and Low- density lipoprotein (LDL- cholesterol) (-4.04±11.64 vs. -1.08±4.35 mg/dl, P =0.2) in the intervention group compared to the control one. Conclusions:  Short-term nutrition education based on BASNEF educational model can improve serum triglyceride level and anthropometric indices of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. Significant findings of the study:  Nutrition education based on BASNEF educational model could reduce body weight, body mass index, waist to hip ratio and serum triglyceride level.
