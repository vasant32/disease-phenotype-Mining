Individuals with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of acquiring melioidosis,             a disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei infection. Although up to half of             melioidosis patients have underlying diabetes, the mechanisms involved in this increased             susceptibility are unknown. We found that B. pseudomallei-infected PBMCs             from diabetic patients were impaired in IL-12p70 production, which resulted in decreased             IFN-γ induction and poor bacterial killing. The defect was specific to the             IL-12-IFN-γ axis. Defective IL-12 production was also observed             during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, in which diabetes is likewise known to be a             strong risk factor. In contrast, IL-12 production in diabetic cells was not affected             upon Salmonella enterica infection or in response to TLR2, -3, -4, and -5 ligands. Poor             IL-12 production correlated with a deficiency in intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH)             concentrations in diabetic patients. Addition of GSH or N-acetylcysteine to PBMCs             selectively restored IL-12 and IFN-γ production and improved bacterial             killing. Furthermore, the depletion of GSH in mice led to increased susceptibility to             melioidosis, reduced production of IL-12p70, and poorer disease outcome. Our data thus             establish a link between GSH deficiency in diabetes and increased susceptibility to             melioidosis that may open up new therapeutic avenues to protect diabetic patients             against some intracellular bacterial pathogens.
