Objectives:  To estimate the incidence of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) among type 2 diabetic subjects in Bangladesh. Methods:  Random samples of 977 patients with diabetes type 2 were recruited retrospectively in 2008 from the naïve patients with diabetes type 2 attended BIRDEM in the year 1993. Baseline information of the cohort was collected in 1993 from hospital record system. Mean time of developing DR in naive diabetic patient was calculated through survival analysis.. Cox proportional hazard model was developed for assessing the confounder for time to event for DR. Results:  The cumulative incidence of DR is 50.6 (CI: 47.5-53.8) over the period of 15 year. Incidence density was 4.1 per 100 person-year (CI: 3.7- 4.5). In male it was 4.2 per 100 person-year (CI: 3.7- 4.7) and in female 4.1 per 100 person-year (CI: 3.6- 4.6). Mean time to develop DR was: 9.72 (CI: 9.38, 10.06). The time was almost similar in male 9.8 (CI: 9.3-10.3) and female 9.6 (CI: 9.5-10.1). Age, sex, Hypertension, lipid profile, HbA1c and serum creatinine were entered into the model simultaneously. Only age (HR 0.75 CI 0.61, 0.92) and HbA1c (HR 0.52, CI 0.33, 0.82) appeared to have significant effect on time to event for developing DR. Conclusions:  Glucose deregulation is the most important factor for the development of DR.
