Pharmacogenetic studies revealed that variants in genes related to the pharmacokinetics of metformin were associated with glucose-lowering effect of metformin. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible associations of the variants in genes encoding organic cationic transporters (SLC22A1, SLC22A2 and SLC47A1) with response to metformin in type 2 diabetes. 148 drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the study. Genotyping for SLC22A1 rs622342, SLC22A2 rs316019 and SLC47A1 rs2289669 variants was done using real-time PCR with subsequent melting-curve analysis. SLC47A1 rs2289669 genotype was significantly associated with the reduction in HbA(1c) after 6 months. 20% of patients with diabetes that are homozygous for A-allele of SLC47A1 had twofold reduction in HbA(1c) in comparison with the patients carrying G-allele (GG+GA: 0.55±0.09% vs. AA: 1.10±0.18%, p=0.018). In conclusion, the results of the present study might have in future practical implication in personalised treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes.
