Objective: This study was designed to assess sexual dysfunction in women suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subjects and Methods: Forty-five type 2 diabetic, non-menopausal married women, aged 20-55 years, who were referred to Shahid Labbafinejad Clinics from March 2008 to June 2009 were included in this study. They were compared to 91 non-diabetic volunteers. Sexual function was evaluated by the sexual function questionnaire. Genitourinary examination was performed in all subjects. Blood sample tests were requested for fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A(1c), 2-hour postprandial glucose and lipid profile measurements. Ophthalmologic and neurologic examinations (checking deep tendon reflexes) were done for cases. Results: The mean age of cases and controls was 42.17± 5.91 and 34.96 ± 8.30 years, respectively (p < 0.001). The prevalence of a high probability of female sexual dysfunction in 6 domains including desire, arousal sensation, arousal lubrication, orgasm, pain and enjoyment was 71.1, 84.4, 55.6, 71.1, 8.9 and 66.7% in the diabetes mellitus women and 56.6, 67.0, 59.3, 57.1, 25.3 and 53.8% in the non-diabetic volunteers, respectively. Differences were statistically significant in the 3 domains of desire, arousal sensation and pain (p < 0.05). Deep tendon reflexes were normal in all and 12.5% showed diabetic retinopathy. Conclusions: Sexual dysfunction in cases as well as in controls was high; however, further studies with a higher number of patients are needed to confirm the results.
