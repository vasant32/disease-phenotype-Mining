Background/Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of modified Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methodology: Forty-five type 2 diabetes mellitus patients underwent modified Roux-en-Y gastric bypass at WeiFang People's Hospital. Data on patient demographics, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body mass index (BMI), medication use, remission and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were prospectively collected and analyzed. Results: At 6 months after surgery, all of these 45 patients obtained remission or a marked improvement. FPG was in the normal range in 39 (86.7%) patients stopping medicine treatment for their diabetes. Six patients (13.3%) had an obvious reduced abnormal FPG and they only required lower drug dosage. No statistically significant differences were found between the obese or non-obese groups (p=0.311). The mean BMI dropped from 28.9±3.0kg/m2 to 27.4±2.8kg/m2 (p=0.000) at the third month and 26.3±2.5kg/m2 (p=0.000) at the sixth month. HbA1c decreased from their preoperative values of 7.4%±2.2% to 6.3%±1.5% (p=0.000) at the third month and 5.1%±0.9% (p=0.000) at the sixth month. Conclusions: Modified Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was effective in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus, independent of body mass index.
