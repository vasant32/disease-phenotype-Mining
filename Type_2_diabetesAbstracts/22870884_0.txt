Efficacy of Kalpaamruthaa (KA) on the modulation of inflammatory markers in cardiovascular disease (CVD) induced by type 2 diabetes mellitus in experimental rats has been investigated in this study. Oxidative stress in hyperglycemia develops CVD by increasing the inflammatory markers. Administration of KA reduced the blood glucose level towards baseline in rats with diabetes induced CVD. Plasma C-reactive protein was elevated in CVD, while its level was markedly reduced upon KA treatment. Inducible nitric oxide synthase and cycloxygenase-2 expressions in immunoblots, interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 expressions in reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α and nuclear factor-κB were increased in CVD-induced rats. KA renders its protection by decreasing these inflammatory markers in CVD-induced rats. Histochemical analysis of mast cell was studied. KA treated rats showed reduced count of mast cell in CVD-induced rat myocardium. This study provides the evidence of cardiovascular protective effect of KA in type 2 diabetes mellitus through its anti-inflammatory property.
