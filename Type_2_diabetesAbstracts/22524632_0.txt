 OBJECTIVE: Our previous study showed there was a gender difference in plasma lactate concentrations in subjects with type 2 diabetes. This study investigated the effect of sex hormone levels on plasma lactic acid (LA) levels in type 2 diabetes with and without metformin therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fasting whole blood specimens of 392 type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin (n=199) or not (n=193) were collected. LA was measured with an enzyme-electrode assay. Levels of sex hormones, including testosterone (T) and estradiol (E(2)), were measured with a chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay. Spearman's or Pearson's correlation and logistic regression analysis were performed for the factors associated with LA. RESULTS: The LA level in the metformin group was significantly higher than that in the non-metformin group (1.26±0.43 vs. 1.14±0.49 mmol/L, P<0.001), and LA levels of females were significantly higher than those of males (P<0.001). LA concentrations were positively correlated with E(2) level but negatively correlated with metformin and T levels (P<0.01). The logistic regression analysis showed that gender, creatinine, E(2), metformin, and T were independent factors influencing lactate levels. Analysis of subgroups demonstrated that the LA concentrations increased with the elevation of E(2) level (P<0.05) but decreased with the rising of T level (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sex hormones play an important role on regulating plasma lactate levels in diabetes patients treated with metformin. E(2) up-regulates but T tend to down-regulate lactate levels.
