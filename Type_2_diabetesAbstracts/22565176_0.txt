Screening for diabetic nephropathy is usually done by albuminuria/24h and the use of creatinine clearance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the renal function in Type 2 diabetes by using different formulas of creatinine clearance and to assess the contribution of cystatin C; 83 adults with type 2 diabetes (23 men and 60 women) and 83 adult controls (40 men and 43 women) were studied. Biochemical parameters were determinated on Coba 6000â„¢ (Roche diagnostics). Diabetics showed a significant increase in blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDLc, the ApoB, Lp(a), urea, uric acid, creatinine and cystatin C and lower HDLc. Cystatin was increased in patients with degenerative complications and in hypertensive patients. We found strong correlations of cystatin C with creatinine (r = 0.9454), urea (r = 0.8999) and uric acid (r = 0.8325). We found a significant exponentially increase of creatinine and cystatin C from one stage to another. Cystatin C has a strong association with MDRD (r = 0.8086) and CG (r = 0.7915) and a low one with creatinine clearance (r = 0.1044). In conclusion, the use of cystatin C for screening and early treatment of incipient diabetic nephropathy appears to be adequate. CG and MDRD formulas still hold their place, in regards to the classical determination of creatinine clearance, to monitor patients.
