OBJECTIVE: Elevated YKL-40 concentrations have been observed in both coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes. Thus, YKL-40 may play a role in pathogenesis of CHD in patients with diabetes. We evaluated whether plasma YKL-40 concentration can predict all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: This is a prospective, observational study PATIENTS: 628 subjects with type 2 diabetes were recruited between July 1996 and June 2003. Plasma YKL-40 concentrations were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cohort was followed-up until 31 December 2008, when vital status and causes of death were obtained. Survival analysis and concordance statistics were performed. All-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were documented. RESULTS: There were 153 (24.36%) mortalities, including 48 participants (7.64%) who died from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Participants with higher plasma YKL-40 (defied with a level above the median of 87.5 μg/l) had an increased risk of mortality. After adjusting for confounding variables, the hazard ratios for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in participants with higher plasma YKL-40 were 1.97 (95% CI: 1.31-2.95, P < 0.01) and 2.45 (95% CI: 1.11-5.37, P < 0.05). The results remained similar after adjustment for age. Concordance statistics revealed that plasma YKL-40 concentration significantly increases the predictive power for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in different models. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma YKL-40 concentration is an independent predictor of 10-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Further investigations on the role of YKL-40 in the pathogenesis of CVD are required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
