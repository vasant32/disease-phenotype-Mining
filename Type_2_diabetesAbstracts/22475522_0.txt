A meta-analysis was performed to assess the associations of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) gene polymorphisms [Gly82Ser (rs2070600), 1704G/T (rs184003), 429T/C (rs1800625)] with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic nephropathy (DN). A comprehensive research was conducted to identify all case-control or cohort studies. The fixed or random effect pooled measure was selected based on the homogeneity test among studies that was evaluated with I(2). Meta-regression was used to explore the potential sources of between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias was estimated using Peters test. Twenty-nine articles were included. Overall, after excluding articles deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls and sensitive analysis, no significant association was found between RAGE gene polymorphisms (Gly82Ser, 1704G/T, 429T/C) and any of T2DM, DR and DN risk, respectively. Subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity (Asian and Caucasian) also found no significant association between the above-mentioned three polymorphisms and T2DM risk, respectively. This meta-analysis suggested that there might be no association of RAGE gene polymorphisms (Gly82Ser, 1704G/T, 429T/C) with T2DM, DR and DN risk.
