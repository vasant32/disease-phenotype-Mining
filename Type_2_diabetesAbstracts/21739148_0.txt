Taurine acts as antioxidant, cell osmolyte, modulator of glucose metabolism, and plays a role in the retinal function. It is 10(3)-fold more concentrated in the intracellular than in the extracellular milieu due to a specific taurine-Na-dependent transporter (TauT), which is upregulated by hypertonicity, low extracellular taurine, or oxidative stress and acutely downregulated 'in vitro' by high glucose concentrations. Aim of this study was to investigate whether TauT expression was modified in mononuclear peripheral blood cells (MPC) of type 2 diabetic patients with or without micro/macrovascular complications. Plasma taurine, as well as other sulphur-containing aminoacids (assayed by HPLC) and TauT gene expression (assayed by real-time PCR analysis) were measured in MPC of 45 controls and of 81 age-and-sex matched type 2 diabetic patients with or without micro/macrovascular complications. Median value (interquartile range) of plasma taurine was significantly lower in diabetic patients than in controls [28.7 (13.7) μmol/l vs. 46.5 (20.3) μmol/l; P<0.05], while median TauT expression, in arbitrary units, was significantly higher in diabetics than in controls [3.8 (3.9) vs. 1 (1.3); P<0.05) and was related to HbA1c only in controls (r=0.34; P<0.05). Patients with retinopathy (n=25) had lower TauT expression than those who were unaffected [3.1 (2.8) vs. 4.1 (3.4); P<0.05], while persistent micro/macroalbuminuria was associated with unchanged TauT expression. A trend toward reduction in TauT expression was observed in patients with macroangiopathy [n=27; 3.3 (2.5) vs. 4 [3.7]; P=NS]. In conclusion, TauT gene is overexpressed in MPC of type 2 diabetic patients, while presence of retinopathy is specifically associated with a drop in TauT overexpression, suggesting its possible involvement in this microangiopathic lesion.
