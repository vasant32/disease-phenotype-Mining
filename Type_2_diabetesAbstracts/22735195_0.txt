PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine the association of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) to weight loss and A1C among participants in a behavioral weight loss intervention.METHODS: Multivariate analyses were employed to evaluate the relationship between SMBG and changes in patient weight and A1C levels. Bootstrapping was used to determine whether there was an indirect effect of SMBG on weight loss through diet adherence and an indirect effect of SMBG on A1C through weight loss.RESULTS: The relationship between increased SMBG and greater weight loss was mediated by better adherence to diet. The relationship of increased SMBG and greater reductions in A1C were mediated by greater weight loss.CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study were consistent with the hypothesis that SMBG leads to an increased adherence to dietary recommendations. For patients who are taught to use their diet to lose weight, increased adherence to dietary recommendations is associated with increased weight loss and subsequently better glucose control. SMBG may be of value as an adjunctive intervention in behavioral programs for type 2 diabetes.
