We measured circulating S100A8/A9 (MRP8/14) complex levels before and after 3-month treatment with pioglitazone in type 2 diabetic patients. The results showed that pioglitazone reduced circulating S100A8/A9 complex levels, without changing body mass index, in type 2 diabetic patients with abdominal obesity.
