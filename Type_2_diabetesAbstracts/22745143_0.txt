 AIM: to investigate the association among ACE gene polymorphism, serum ACE level and atherosclerotic lesion in offspring of type 2 diabetes in Jakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: a cross sectional study was conducted among 73 nondiabetic and normotensive offspring of type 2 diabetes subjects. Each subject underwent medical history taking, physical examination, laboratory examination (oral glucose tolerance test, lipid profile, ace gene polymorphism, serum ace level) and atherosclerotic lesions (carotid intima media thickness or atherosclerosis plaque) examination using B-mode USG. RESULTS: among 73 subjects, the proportions of genotype DD, ID and II are 10, 38, and 52% respectively. There is association between ACE gene polymorphism and serum ACE level (p=0.000). Among 3 genotypes, II has the lowest value of serum ace level which is statistically significant. The prevalence of atherosclerotic lesion in this study is 45.2%. There is no correlation between ACE gene polymorphism and atherosclerotic lesion. CONCLUSION: the insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene was associated with serum ACE level but not with atherosclerotic lesion in carotid arteries among offspring of type 2 diabetes subjects.
