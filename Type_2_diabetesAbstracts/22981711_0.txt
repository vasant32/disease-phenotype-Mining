Type 2 diabetes mellitus has emerged as a major non-communicable chronic diseases in many countries. The importance of exercise in the prevention and management of this disease is evident. This paper briefly reviews the effects of combining aerobic and resistance exercises on glycemic control, and details the training and characteristics of various interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Literature searches were performed using electronic databases between the 1st of January 1950 and the 15th of September 2011. Of the 403 articles retrieved, 28 studies met our inclusion criteria. Combined exercise protocols seem to improve glycemic control to a greater extent than isolated forms of exercise. Nevertheless, length, duration, intensity, mode, number of exercises, sets and repetitions varied markedly among studies. Supervised training sessions, recommended structured exercises, and splitting aerobic and resistance training in separate sessions may be relevant for best results. Future studies should analyze the effects of different aerobic and resistance training modes, different training and progression methods, and whether one type of exercise is optimal, as these issues are likely to convey greater knowledge on type 2 diabetes mellitus management through combined exercise.
