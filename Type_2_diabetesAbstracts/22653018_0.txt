Secondary osteoporosis is caused by various disorders, metabolic derangements, and drug administration. Among causative disorders, primary hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease are prevalent ones. Fractures in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease tend to result from the reduction in bone quality rather than that in bone mass.
