 AIMS: To determine the prevalence and distribution of abnormal plasma liver enzymes in a representative sample of older adults with Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and γ-glutamyltransferase were measured in a randomly selected, population-based cohort of 1066 men and women aged 60-75 years with Type 2 diabetes (the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study). RESULTS: Overall, 29.1% (95% CI 26.1-31.8) of patients had one or more plasma liver enzymes above the upper limit of the normal reference range. Only 10.1% of these patients had a prior history of liver disease and a further 12.4% reported alcohol intake above recommended limits. Alanine aminotransferase was the most commonly raised liver enzyme (23.1% of patients). The prevalence of abnormal liver enzymes was significantly higher in men (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.83), in the youngest 5-year age band (odds ratio 2.02, 95% CI 1.44-2.84), in patients with diabetes duration < 5 years (odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.90), plasma HbA(1c) ≥ 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) (odds ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.88), obese BMI (odds ratio 2.84, 95% CI 1.59-3.06) and secondary care management for their diabetes (odds ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.05-1.87). However, all these factors combined accounted for only 7.6% of the variation in liver enzyme abnormality. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of elevated liver enzymes in people with Type 2 diabetes is high, with only modest variation between clinically defined patient groups. Further research is required to determine the prognostic value of raised, routinely measured liver enzymes to inform decisions on appropriate follow-up investigations.
