Oral repaglinide (GlucoNorm®; NovoNorm®; Prandin®; Surepost®) is a rapid-acting insulin secretagogue that lowers postprandial glucose (PPG) excursions by targeting early-phase insulin release, with reductions in PPG considered to be important in reducing long-term cardiovascular complications of diabetes mellitus. Repaglinide, a carbamoylbenzoic acid derivative, is chemically related to the meglitinide class of insulin secretagogues, but unrelated to the sulfonylurea insulin secretagogues. Meglitinides, including repaglinide, have a distinct binding site at the β-cell membrane, which differs from that of sulfonylureas, and corresponds to greater insulinotropic effects with repaglinide than with glibenclamide and/or glimepiride and a more rapid onset of action in in vitro and in vivo studies. This article reviews the clinical efficacy and tolerability of oral repaglinide in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and provides an overview of its pharmacological properties. In well designed clinical trials of up to 52 weeks' duration and in the clinical practice setting, recommended dosages of repaglinide (0.5-4 mg three times daily up to 30 minutes prior to a meal) provided effective glycaemic control and were generally well tolerated in treatment-naive or -experienced adult patients with type 2 diabetes, including elderly patients and those with renal impairment. Furthermore, as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs, repaglinide was at least as effective as other oral antihyperglycaemic drugs at improving or maintaining glycaemic control, with a tolerability profile that was generally similar to that of sulfonylurea drugs and nateglinide. Thus, repaglinide remains an effective option for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes.
