 OBJECTIVE: To summarize and evaluate the available literature assessing the efficacy and safety of exenatide once weekly for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. DATA SOURCES: PubMed (1966-January 2012) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1969-January 2012) were searched using the term exenatide once weekly. Abstracts presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting in 2011 and reference citations from publications were reviewed for inclusion. Eli Lilly and Company and Amylin Pharmaceuticals were contacted for additional unpublished information. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles and abstracts were evaluated for inclusion. All randomized controlled trials were included in the review. DATA SYNTHESIS: The efficacy and safety of exenatide once weekly has been evaluated as initial monotherapy and as add-on therapy to metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes for up to 3 years. Results from 6 randomized, comparator-controlled studies in over 3000 patients indicate that treatment with exenatide once weekly results in significant glycemic improvements and weight loss. Gastrointestinal adverse effects and injection site reactions are common, but rarely lead to drug discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide once weekly holds promise as a convenient, efficacious, and well-tolerated antihyperglycemic agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Studies evaluating outcomes such as cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality with exenatide once weekly are lacking.
