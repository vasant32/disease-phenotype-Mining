Although blood pressure control has undoubtedly proven its benefits in reducing the high cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it still remains unclear whether intensive antihypertensive treatment in old age (> 75 years) is beneficial. Many of the current guidelines recommend a systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mmHg or lower, unless patients are at high risk for possible adverse events such as postural hypotension (1,2). This perspective aims to get a discussion started on the appropriate target SBP value for patients with T2DM aged older than 75 years.We would like to propose the less stringent value of< 160 mmHg in this specific population.
