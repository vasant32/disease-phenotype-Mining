ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Weight loss is often difficult to achieve in individuals with type 2 diabetes and anti-obesity drugs are often advocated to support dietary intervention. Despite the extensive use of centrally acting anti-obesity drugs, there is little evidence of how they affect dietary composition. We investigated changes in energy intake and dietary composition of macro- and micronutrients following therapy with the endocannabinoid receptor blocker, rimonabant. METHODS: 20 obese patients with type 2 diabetes were studied before and after 6 months dietary intervention with rimonabant. Dietary intervention was supervised by a diabetes dietician. Five-day food diaries were completed at baseline and at 6 months and dietary analysis was performed using computer software (Dietplan 6). RESULTS: After 6 months, (compared with baseline) there were reductions in weight (107+/-21Kg versus 112+/-21, p<0.001, 4% body weight reduction), and improvements in HbA1c (7.4+/-1.7 versus 8.0+/-1.6%, p<0.05) and HDL cholesterol. Intake of energy (1589+/-384 versus 2225+/-1109kcal, p<0.01), carbohydrate (199+/-74 versus 273+/-194g, p<0.05), protein (78+/-23 versus 98+/-36g, p<0.05), fats (55+/-18 versus 84+/-39g, p<0.01) and several micronutrients were reduced. However, relative macronutrient composition of the diet was unchanged. Improvement in blood glucose was strongly correlated with a reduction in carbohydrate intake (r = 0.76, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, rimonabant in combination with dietary intervention led to reduced intake of energy and most macronutrients. Despite this, macronutrient composition of the diet was unaltered. These dietary changes (especially carbohydrate restriction) were associated with weight loss and favourable metabolic effects.
