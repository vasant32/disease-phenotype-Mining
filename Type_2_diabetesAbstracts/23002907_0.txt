Recently published guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommend using a two-stage approach to identify those at high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes: screening using a validated self-assessment questionnaire or computer-based risk assessment tool, followed (in those with a high risk score) by a blood test for either HbA(1c) or fasting glucose [1]. The presence of a fasting glucose level of 5.5-6.9 mmol/l or HbA(1c) 42-47 mmol/mol categorizes a person as high risk for progression to Type 2 diabetes. We assessed the practical impact of this screening strategy in a cohort of 2253 participants aged over 40 years, and not known to have diabetes, recruited from the Exeter 10000 study. © 2012 The Authors.
