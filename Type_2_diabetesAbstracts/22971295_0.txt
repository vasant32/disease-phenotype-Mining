Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end stage renal disease in the Western world. 30-35% of the patients with type 2 diabetes will have micro- or macroalbuminuria, warranting yearly screening. Treatment to prevent diabetic nephropathy is multifactorial, adressing known progression promoters such as blood pressure, glycaemia, dyslipidaemia and smoking and includes antithrombotic prophylaxis. Although progress has been made over the last few decades, there is still an unmet need for improved screening, prevention and treatment since both cardiac and renal morbidity and mortality remains severe in this group of patients.
