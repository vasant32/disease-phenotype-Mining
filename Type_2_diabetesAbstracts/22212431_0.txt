 AIM: AVE8134 is a structurally novel potent PPARα agonist. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of AVE8134 on lipid profile and glucose metabolism in dyslipidemic mice and type 2 diabetic rats. METHODS: A cell based PPAR Gal4 transactivation assay was constructed for testing the activities of AVE8134 at 3 different PPAR isoforms in vitro. Transgenic human Apo A1 (hApo A1) mice and insulin-resistant ZDF rats were used to evaluate the effects of AVE8134 in vivo. RESULTS: AVE8134 was a full PPARα dominated PPAR agonist (the values of EC(50) for human and rodent PPARα receptor were 0.01 and 0.3 μmol/L, respectively). AVE8134 was not active at PPARδ receptor. In female hApo A1 mice, AVE8134 (1-30 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), po for 12 d) dose-dependently lowered the plasma triglycerides, and increased the serum HDL-cholesterol, hApo A1 and mouse Apo E levels. In female ZDF rats, AVE8134 (3-30 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 2 weeks) improved insulin-sensitivity index. In pre-diabetic male ZDF rats (at the age of 7 weeks), AVE8134 (10 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 8 weeks) produced an anti-diabetic action comparable to rosiglitazone, without the PPARγ mediated adverse effects on body weight and heart weight. In male ZDF rats (at the age of 6 weeks), AVE8134 (20 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1) for 12 weeks) increased mRNA levels of the target genes LPL and PDK4 about 20 fold in the liver, and there was no relevant effect with rosiglitazone. CONCLUSION: AVE8134 improves lipid profile and glucose metabolism in dyslipidemic mice and type 2 diabetic rats.
