This study on individuals with type 2 diabetes living in Japan aimed to examine work-related factors that influence self-care and psychological health among people. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 121 working adults with type 2 diabetes. A self-report questionnaire assessed demographics, work characteristics, self-disclosure of diabetes, support in the workplace, work-related difficulties due to diabetes, and workplace conformity. Dietary self-care, exercise, depression, and emotional distress were also evaluated. The results indicated statistically significant influence of working night shifts, self-disclosure of diabetes, and workplace conformity on dietary self-care. Work-related difficulties due to diabetes had negative effects on depression and emotional distress, and job control and support in the workplace were found to be correlated with emotional distress. These findings suggest that work-related factors have an impact on some forms of self-care activities and psychological health and that it is important to increase understanding of these issues and provide appropriate support for workers through education and counseling and adjustments in the workplace.
