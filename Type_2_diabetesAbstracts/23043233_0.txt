Introduction: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic and progressive disease, and ultimately, most patients will require insulin therapy for the optimization of their glycemic control. Areas covered: We review the recent literature investigating the efficacy and safety of the insulin analogue lispro in type 2 diabetes. Relevant publications were identified by means of a PubMed literature search in the period January 1990 to May 2012. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which included at least one arm evaluating insulin lispro in type 2 diabetes. Expert opinion: Insulin is the most effective therapy for reducing hyperglycemia: when the desired decrease of HbA1c is â‰¥ 1.5%, it is unlikely than any other antidiabetes drug may work as better as insulin. The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of lispro analogues offer discrete advantage over human insulin. The preliminary results of comparative RCTs versus insulin glargine or insulin detemir indicate that insulin lispro protamine suspension (ILPS) has a similar effect on glucose control and the risk of hypoglycemia while using lower doses when injected once a day. Lispro/ILPS premixed formulations can be injected immediately before a meal because they are absorbed more rapidly than premixed human insulin, thus allowing more flexibility with insulin therapy.
