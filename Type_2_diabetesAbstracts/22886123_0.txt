 OBJECTIVE: To determine the occurrence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as to assess the relationship between the occurrence of symptoms of anxiety and depression, quality of life, and level of acceptance of illness of  patients in northeastern Poland. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 126 patients with type 2 diabetes in the Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Internal Diseases,    Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland from February 2010 to March 2011. Three questionnaires were administered: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Acceptance of Illness Scale, and SF-36v2 Scale. RESULTS: Symptoms of anxiety were found in 30.4% of  patients and depression in 32%, more often in women than men (20.6% versus 10.3% for anxiety and 22.2% versus 10.3% for depression). Multiple regression analysis revealed that 50% of variance on the illness acceptance scale affected the quality of life in relation to the general health PCS and MCS. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of anxiety and depression adversely affect the degree of acceptance of illness and significantly lower the quality of life in patients with diabetes. Lowered quality of life is an important predictor of worse acceptance of illness by patients.
