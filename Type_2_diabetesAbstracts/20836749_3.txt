We hypothesised that the correlation between autoantibody specificity for the ZnT8 Arg325Trp isoforms and the type 2 diabetes-associated rs13266634 may affect β-cell function at type 1 diabetes (T1D) onset. To study this, we tested 482 newly diagnosed diabetic probands and 478 healthy siblings from the Danish population-based T1D registry for autoantibodies to ZnT8 (ZnT8A) in addition to GAD65 and IA-2. The prevalence and titres of autoantibodies were correlated with genotypes for rs13266634 and HLA-DQB1, age at diagnosis (AAD) and insulin dose-adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c), as a proxy for residual β-cell function. We replicated the correlation between rs13266634 genotypes and specificity for the ZnT8-Argenine (ZnT8R) and ZnT8-Tryptophan (ZnT8W) isoforms previously reported. ZnT8A overlapped substantially with autoantibodies to glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GADA) and IA-2 (IA-2A) and correlated significantly with IA-2A prevalence (p < 2e-16). No effect on IDAA1c was demonstrated for ZnT8A or rs13266634. We found a correlation between ZnT8R positivity and HLA-DQB1*0302 genotypes (p = 0.016), which has not been shown previously. Furthermore, significantly lower ZnT8R and GADA prevalence and titres was found among probands with AAD < 5 years (prevalence: p = 0.004 and p = 0.0001; titres: p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). The same trend was observed for IA-2A and ZnT8W; however, the difference was non-significant. Our study confirms ZnT8 as a major target for autoantibodies at disease onset in our Danish T1D cohort of children and adolescents, and we have further characterised the relationship between autoantibody specificity for the ZnT8 Arg325Trp epitopes and rs13266634 in relation to established autoantibodies, AAD, measures of β-cell function and HLA-DQB1 genotypes in T1D.
