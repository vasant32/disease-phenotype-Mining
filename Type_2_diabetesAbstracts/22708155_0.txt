 AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the views of older people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes on the care they received from healthcare professionals. METHOD: Twenty five people aged between 72 and 84 with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes participated in telephone interviews. FINDINGS: Data analysis identified four main themes: healthcare professionals' consideration of patients' financial difficulties; being treated like an individual; healthcare professionals' understanding of the type of diabetes experienced by patients; and how impaired cognitive function affects diabetes self-management. CONCLUSION: Older people with diabetes should be treated as individuals by staff. Care should take into consideration: the patient's knowledge of the condition; the type of diabetes experienced and its duration; and identify any problems the patient may have with self-management.
