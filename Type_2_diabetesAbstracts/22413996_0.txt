Diabet. Med. 29, 1253-1259 (2012) ABSTRACT: Aims  Vitamin D levels are inversely related to blood pressure. Given that low sun exposure can create a greater reliance on dietary sources of vitamin D, we aimed to determine whether dietary vitamin D and blood pressure associations differ between periods of low and high sun exposure. Methods  Dietary intake, vitamin supplementation, blood pressure, and anthropometric parameters were assessed each season for 1 year (174 adults with Type 2 diabetes). Separate linear regression models were constructed for high and low sun exposure periods to examine associations of systolic blood pressure with dietary vitamin D intake and vitamin supplement use (adjusted for age, gender, BMI, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, antihypertensive medication and nutrient intake). Robustness of findings was confirmed with within-subject repeated measures analysis, including an interaction term for sun exposure period. Results  Vitamin D intake from food sources was low year-round and no conclusive association with blood pressure was identified during either period. Systolic blood pressure was 5.1 mmHg lower during the low sun exposure period (95% CI 0.5-9.7) in daily supplement users compared with non-users. The interaction term between supplement use and sun exposure period was significant (low sun exposure* no supplement, P = 0.02). Systolic blood pressure was relatively stable in users (low and high sun exposure periods, respectively, mean ± SE: 135.2 ± 2.6 mmHg and 134.2 ± 2.5 mmHg), but not in non-users (140.2 ± 2.7 mmHg and 130.5 ± 2.5 mmHg). Conclusions  Vitamin supplementation may stabilize systolic blood pressure in adults with Type 2 diabetes across seasons.
