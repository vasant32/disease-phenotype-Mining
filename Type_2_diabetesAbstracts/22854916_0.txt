We hypothesized that the influence of metabolic parameters depends on metabolic syndrome (MetS) status. The clinical and metabolic implications of postprandial triglyceride (ppTG) in Korean type 2 diabetes were investigated in the presence or absence of MetS, MetS+, or MetS-. To investigate the relationship between ppTG and metabolic parameters, we analyzed plasma TG levels in 126 newly diagnosed, drug-naïve diabetic patients after ingestion of a standardized low calorie and fat (500 kcal, 17.5 g fat) liquid meal formula. We report that MetS+ patients have significantly higher BMI, waist/hip ratio, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β, but insignificantly higher fasting TG, ppTG, and ΔTG than MetS- patients. In the MetS+ patients, ppTG correlated with fasting TG and non-HDL, but was not related to HOMA-IR. In MetS- patients, ppTG correlated with fasting TG, non-HDL, blood pressure, waist/hip ratio, fasting C-peptide and insulin levels, and HOMA-IR. Multivariate analysis showed HOMA-IR to be a predictive factor for ppTG in MetS- patients but not in MetS+ patients. ppTG correlated with IR in MetS- type 2 diabetic patients but not in MetS+. This unexpected result implies that MetS+ diabetic patients already have high fasting TG and that IR influences fasting TG more dominantly than ppTG.
