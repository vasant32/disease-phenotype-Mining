 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the levels of plasma CD146 and P-selectin in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy at different stages. METHODS: A total of 80 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled in the present study. According to 24h urinary albumin excretion ratio and renal function, they were further divided into group of diabetes without microalbuminuria (DN0, n=20), microalbuminuria group (DN1, n=20), macroalbuminuria group (DN2, n=20) and renal insufficiency group (DN3, n=20). Another 20 healthy subjects were enrolled as control group (non-DM). Plasma CD146 and P-selectin were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Plasma CD146 and P-selectin were significantly increased in patients with type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria (DN1) compared with health control (CD146: 415.3±29.0 vs. 243.5±14.7 ng/ml, P<0.05; P-selectin: 66.8±3.4 vs. 45.3±2.7 ng/ml, P<0.001). With the development of diabetic nephropathy, both plasma CD146 and P-selectin level progressively rise, with the highest levels in patients with significant renal insufficiency (DN3: 515.9±36.9 and 81.5±5.1 ng/ml respectively, P<0.001). Moreover, the increase in CD146 is positively co-related to the rise of P-selectin in patients with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: Expression of CD146 and P-selectin in patients with type 2 diabetes is elevated, and they are positively correlated with severity of diabetic nephropathy.
