 PURPOSE: Little research has been conducted on the epidemiology of urinary incontinence in individuals with type 2 diabetes. We examined prevalence, incidence and risk factors for urinary incontinence among women with type 2 diabetes in the NHS (Nurses' Health Study) and NHS II. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained urinary incontinence information at study baseline (2000 in NHS and 2001 in NHS II) and 2 followup periods (2002 and 2004 in the NHS, and 2003 and 2005 in the NHS II). Among women with type 2 diabetes we calculated the prevalence of urinary incontinence for 9,994 women with baseline urinary incontinence information, and urinary incontinence incidence rates for 4,331 women with no urinary incontinence at baseline and urinary incontinence information during followup. Multivariable adjusted odds ratios and relative risks were estimated for associations between possible risk factors and urinary incontinence. RESULTS: The prevalence of at least monthly urinary incontinence was 48% and at least weekly urinary incontinence was 29% among women with type 2 diabetes, and the corresponding incidence rates were 9.1 and 3.4 per 100 person-years, respectively. White race, higher body mass index, higher parity, lower physical activity, current postmenopausal hormone use and diuretic use were risk factors for prevalent and incident urinary incontinence in this study, and hysterectomy, vascular disease and longer duration of diabetes were associated with increased odds of prevalent urinary incontinence only. Increasing age and microvascular complications were associated with a greater risk of frequent urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary incontinence was common in this study of women with type 2 diabetes. We identified multiple risk factors for urinary incontinence in these women, several of which suggest ways to reduce urinary incontinence.
