We write with respect to the recent publication by Nandakoban et al. [1] describing a case of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis in a patient treated with exenatide. Of interest, a recent manuscript by Pendergrass et al. [2] described no association between exenatide and acute renal failure in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Exenatide has been widely used in the UK over the past 4 years to treat Type 2 diabetes in combination with metformin and/or sulphonylurea in patients with inadequate glycaemic control. © 2012 The Authors.
