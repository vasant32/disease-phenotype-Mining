Novel biomarkers predicting onset or progression of nephropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes have been recently identified. We performed a systematic review to assess the validity of biomarkers predicting onset or progression of nephropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes in longitudinal studies. The methodological quality of the studies was scored using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) criteria and the independent predictive value of the biomarkers beyond conventional risk factors was scored according to the adjustment for these risk factors. Validity of the biomarkers was determined by summarizing the methodological quality and the adjustment score. We identified 15 studies describing 27 biomarkers. Six studies had sufficient methodological quality. These studies identified 13 valid and significant markers for nephropathy in diabetes: serum interleukin 18, plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine; and urinary ceruloplasmin, immunoglobulin G and transferrin were considered valid markers predicting onset of nephropathy. Plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, interleukin 6, von Willebrand factor and intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 were considered valid biomarkers predicting progression of nephropathy. Plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, E-selectin, tissue-type plasminogen activator, von Willebrand factor and triglycerides were considered valid markers predicting onset and progression of nephropathy. Several novel biomarkers for prediction of nephropathy in diabetes have been published, which can potentially be applied in clinical practice and research in future. Because of the heterogeneous quality of biomarker studies in this field, a more rigorous evaluation of these biomarkers and validation in larger trials are advocated.
