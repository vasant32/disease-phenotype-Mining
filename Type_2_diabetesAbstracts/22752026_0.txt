 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance are often associated with the co-occurrence of coronary atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction. The aim of this study was to define the independent relationships between left ventricular dysfunction or ischaemia and patterns of myocardial perfusion and metabolism in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Twenty-four type 2 diabetic patients--12 with coronary artery disease (CAD) and preserved left ventricular function and 12 with non-ischaemic heart failure (HF)--were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to assess myocardial blood flow (MBF) at rest, after pharmacological stress and under euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia. Insulin-mediated myocardial glucose disposal was determined with 2-deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoroglucose PET. RESULTS: There was no difference in myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) between the healthy myocardium of CAD patients and the dysfunctional myocardium of HF patients. MGU was strongly influenced by levels of systemic insulin resistance in both groups (CAD, r = 0.85, p = 0.005; HF, r = 0.77, p = 0.01). In HF patients, there was an inverse association between MGU and the coronary flow reserve (r = -0.434, p = 0.0115). A similar relationship was observed in non-ischaemic segments of CAD patients. Hyperinsulinaemia increased MBF to a similar extent in the non-ischaemic myocardial of CAD and HF patients. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In type 2 diabetes, similar metabolic and perfusion patterns can be detected in the non-ischaemic regions of CAD patients with normal cardiac function and in the dysfunctional non-ischaemic myocardium of HF patients. This suggests that insulin resistance, rather than diagnosis of ischaemia or left ventricular dysfunction, affects the metabolism and perfusion features of patients with type 2 diabetes.
