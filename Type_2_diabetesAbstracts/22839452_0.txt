ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the risk of developing common cancers in the Chinese population. METHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study was carried out in the Nan-Hu district of Jiaxing city, Zhejiang province, China. The incidence of cancer cases among type 2 diabetic patients from January 2002 to June 2008 was identified through record-linkage of the Diabetic Surveillance and Registry Database with the Cancer Database. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and its 95% CI (confidence interval) were used to estimate the risk of cancer among the patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: The overall incidence of cancer was 1083.6 x 105 in male T2DM patients and 870.2 x 105 in females. Increased risk of developing cancer was found in both male and female T2DM patients with an SIR of 1.331 (95% CI=1.143-1.518) and 1.737 (95% CI=1.478-1.997), respectively. With regard to cancer subtypes, both male and female T2DM patients had a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer with the SIRs of 2.973 (95% CI=1.731-4.21.) and 2.687 (1.445-3.928), respectively. Elevated risk of liver and kidney cancers was only found in male T2DM patients with SIRs of 1.538 (1.005-2.072) and 4.091 (1.418-6.764), respectively. Increased risk of developing breast cancer (SIR: 2.209 [1.487-2.93]) and leukemia (SIR: 4.167 [1.584- 6.749]) was found in female patients. CONCLUSIONS: These finding indicated that patients with T2DM have an increased risk of developing cancer. Additional cancer screening should be employed in the management of patients with T2DM.
