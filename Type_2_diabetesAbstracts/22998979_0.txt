Ginseng polysaccharide is known to have anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects in vivo and its precise mechanism of action is not clear. A urinary metabolomics method based on rapid-resolution liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (RRLC/MS) was developed to investigate the effect of water-soluble ginseng polysaccharide (WGP) on type 2 diabetes in rats. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out for pattern recognition and a clear separation between type 2 diabetic rats and those treated with WGP was achieved. Eight potential biomarkers were found and identified. Significantly increased inosine, serotonin, phenylpropionylglycine and dodecanedioic acid showed the effect of WGP on purine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and energy metabolism. 1-Methyladenine, 4-deoxyerythronic acid, 5-hydroxyhexanoic acid and tetrahydrocortisol were significantly decreased which indicated that WGP can regulate DNA metabolism, organic acids metabolism and steroid hormone metabolism. This work is helpful in the effect mechanism study of ginseng polysaccharide.
