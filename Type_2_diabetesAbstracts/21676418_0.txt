The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a high triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio is associated with an increased incidence of retinopathy and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 979) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min and without retinopathy and cardiovascular disease at baseline were followed up for the incidence of diabetic retinopathy (diagnosed by retinography) and CKD (diagnosed by estimated glomerular filtration rate â‰¤60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). On follow-up (mean, 4.9 years), 217 (22.2% of total) subjects experienced CKD and/or diabetic-specific retinal lesions (microvascular complication). Of these, 111 subjects developed isolated retinopathy, 85 developed CKD alone, and 21 developed both complications. The TG/HDL-C ratio was positively associated with an increased risk of incident retinopathy and/or CKD (composite microvascular end point) independently of age, sex, body mass index, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A(1c), hypertension, smoking history, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albuminuria, and current use of hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, or antiplatelet drugs (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio, 2.15; 95% confidence intervals, 1.10-4.25; P = .04). These findings suggested that the TG/HDL-C ratio was associated with an increased incidence of microvascular complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus without prior cardiovascular disease, independently of several potential confounders.
