Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents are two emerging public health problems. The clinical presentation of type 2 diabetes in youth is heterogeneous, from minimal symptomatology to diabetic ketoacidosis. The clinical distinction between a type 2 diabetic young patient and a type 1 diabetic obese patient is often difficult because of the overlapping clinical picture with evidence of islet autoimmunity in a significant proportion of clinically diagnosed youth with type 2 diabetes.
