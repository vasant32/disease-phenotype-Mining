In diabetes, the prevalence of tendon degeneration is increased. As neoangiogenesis is impaired in several diabetic complications, the aim of this study is to evaluate the neovessel formation in tendinopathies. Patients aged more than 55 years were selected, and divided into two groups: a) type 2 diabetic patients, and b) non-diabetic subjects. In both groups, those with ultrasound features of tendinopathy were included, and intratendinous vascularisation was estimated by means of Power Doppler. Ultrasound features of tendinopathy were observed in 104 diabetic subjects and in 221 controls. Neovascularisation, with higher Power Doppler scores, was found more frequently in controls, while lower Power Doppler scores were prevalent in diabetic subjects. In subjects with diabetes, tendinopathic features are significantly higher than healthy controls, while the prevalence of neovascularization inside tendons is less represented.
