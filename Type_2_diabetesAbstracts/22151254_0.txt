Background:  Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 40 common sequence variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the results are not always the same in populations with differing genetic backgrounds. In the present study, we evaluated a hypothesis that a North Asian population living in a geographic area with unusually harsh environmental conditions would develop unique genetic risks. Methods:  A population-based association study was performed with 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine genes selected according to the results of GWAS conducted in other populations. The study participants included 393 full-heritage Mongolian individuals (177 diagnosed with T2D and 216 matched controls). Genotyping was performed by TaqMan methodology. Results:  The strongest association was detected with SNPs located within the potassium channel-coding genes KCNQ1 (highest odds ratio [OR] = 1.92; P = 3.4 × 10(-5) ) and ABCC8 (OR = 1.79; P = 5 × 10(-4) ). Genetic variants identified as strongly influencing the risk of T2D in other populations (e.g. KCNJ11 or TCF7L2) did not show significant association in Mongolia. Conclusions:  The strongest T2D risk-associated SNPs in Mongolians are located within two of three tested potassium channel-coding genes. Accumulated variations in these genes may be related to the exposure to harsh environmental conditions.
