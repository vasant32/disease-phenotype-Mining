Forty-seven patients with cerebral stroke and diabetes mellitus type 2 were included in the study. To maintain the target values of glycemia on the level 7.8-10.2 mmol/l, patients of the main group received the continuous intravenous infusion of insulin and patients of the control group received frequent (every 3h) subcutaneous injections of insulin during the first 24 h after the acute cerebral blood flow disturbance. The results obtained have shown that continuous intravenous insulin infusion reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, accelerates positive neurologic dynamics, reduces terms of hospitalization and decreases mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2.
