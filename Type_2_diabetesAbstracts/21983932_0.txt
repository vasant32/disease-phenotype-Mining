This study investigated the association of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) alpha single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with type 2 diabetes with or without metabolic syndrome in Malaysia. Nine HNF4 alpha SNPs were genotyped in 390 type 2 diabetic subjects with metabolic syndrome, 135 type 2 diabetic subjects without metabolic syndrome, and 160 control subjects. The SNPs rs4810424, rs1884613, and rs2144908 were associated with protection against type 2 diabetes without metabolic syndrome (recessive P = 0.018, OR 0.32; P = 0.004, OR 0.25; P = 0.005, OR 0.24, respectively). The 6-SNP haplotype2 CCCGTC containing the risk genotype of these SNPs was associated with higher risk for type 2 diabetes with or without metabolic syndrome (P = 0.002, OR 2.2; P = 0.004, OR 3.1). These data suggest that HNF4 alpha SNPs and haplotypes contributed to increased type 2 diabetes risk in the Malaysian population.
