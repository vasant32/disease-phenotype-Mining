PURPOSE:  Chinese Americans are at high risk for type 2 diabetes and face some health disparities that can be attributed to language barriers, cultural differences, and access to care. The purpose of this article is to review current literature and establish best practices regarding health communication about type 2 diabetes for Chinese Americans. The authors reviewed clinical research literature from January 2000 to April 2011 to assess current knowledge about providing diabetes management guidance to Chinese Americans. CONCLUSIONS:  To improve health communication and dissemination of health information to Chinese Americans regarding diabetes and diabetes management, research scholars, health care providers, and diabetes educators can analyze current health messages by source, message, audience, channel, and destination characteristics. Extensive research has led to clear guidelines focusing on language-appropriate materials, an understanding of Chinese food beliefs and family practices, and the importance of culturally competent health care providers. However, many Chinese Americans are using Chinese foods and medicinal herbs with little communication between patients and providers about these practices. Although Chinese Americans are not a homogenous group, this article points to a set of cultural considerations that health care providers should address when working with Chinese Americans. By attending to various qualities of health messages, efforts at diabetes prevention and management may be greatly enhanced.
