 BACKGROUND: To address the increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes healthcare organisations have been contemplating different screening and intervention strategies. Patient acceptability is a key criterion of a screening programme. AIM: To explore  the perspectives of those invited to attend the MY-WAIST screening study for type 2 diabetes, particularly explanations for attending or not, and views on the specific screening strategy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study of 11 general practices in Leicestershire, UK. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 individuals (40-69 years) invited to attend the MY-WAIST screening study, comprising 13 who attended and 11 who did not attend the screening. Additional data included reply slips from 73 individuals who declined  the offer of screening. Analysis was informed by the constant comparative method. RESULTS: Two categories of influence on the decision about attending screening emerged. 1) Beliefs about type 2 diabetes candidacy and type 2 diabetes was more common among those who had attended;  lack of perceived severity of type 2 diabetes was more common among those who did not attend. 2) Practical aspects about the screening strategy: the lengthy, early morning screening appointments were a barrier to uptake; screening attendees found the procedure largely acceptable. Pre-screening  waist self-measurement was more memorable than the remainder of the risk-score calculation; neither impacted on uptake. CONCLUSION: The barriers to screening uptake highlighted contribute to current debates about different screening and diagnostic tests for type 2 diabetes  and future risk of type 2 diabetes. The findings are useful for those contemplating implementation of screening programmes for identifying type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes.
