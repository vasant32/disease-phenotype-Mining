Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder which affects carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism. There is a strong relation between some specific oligoelements and diabetes mellitus. The study was undertaken to determine serum levels of copper and zinc in 60 type 2 diabetic (Group I) and 60 healthy non-diabetic subjects (Group II). Diabetic patients studied were without any complications. Serum copper and zinc were estimated by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The serum copper levels (144.00±12.87μg/dl) significantly increased in Group I compared to Group II (138.50±11.00μg/dl). On the other hand, the Plasma zinc (72.70±8.43μg/dl) levels significantly decreased in type 2 diabetic patients compared to control group (75.92±8.20μg/dl). It is concluded that type 2 diabetes mellitus can result in changes in copper and zinc levels. However, it is difficult to draw any definite conclusion from this small study sample but may be suggested that estimation of both copper and zinc is better to be considered in those cases.
