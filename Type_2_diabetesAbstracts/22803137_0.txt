Activities of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 7 and α1-proteinase inhibitor were measured in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Correlations between enzyme activity and the main parameters of carbohydrate metabolism were studied. In patients, significant reduction of matrix metalloproteinase activity in the serum was noted, which correlated with the decrease in blood concentration of C-peptide (r=0.8). At the same time, serum activity of α1-proteinase inhibitor increased. No significant relationships between patient's age, glucose concentration, fructosamine concentration, and matrix metalloproteinase activity were observed.
