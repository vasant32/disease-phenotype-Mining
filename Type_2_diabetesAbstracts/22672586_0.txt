Background:  The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin therapy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who failed to achieve adequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy. Methods:  After a metformin titration/stabilization period and a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 395 Chinese patients with T2DM aged 25-77 years (baseline HbA1c 8.5%) were randomized (1:1) to double-blind placebo or sitagliptin 100 mg q.d. added to ongoing open-label metformin (1000 or 1700 mg/day) for 24 weeks. Results:  Significant (P < 0.001) changes from baseline in HbA1c (-0.9%), fasting plasma glucose (-1.2 mmol/L), and 2-h post-meal plasma glucose (-1.9 mmol/L) were seen with sitagliptin compared with placebo. There were no significant differences between sitagliptin and placebo in the incidence of hypoglycemia or gastrointestinal adverse events. A small decrease from baseline body weight was observed in the placebo group compared with no change in the sitagliptin group (between-group difference 0.5 kg; P = 0.018). Conclusions:  The addition of sitagliptin 100 mg to ongoing metformin therapy significantly improved glycemic control and was generally well tolerated in Chinese patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin alone.
