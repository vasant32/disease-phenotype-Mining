In this first report on the association of an IL-10 promoter polymorphism with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a North Indian population, the -592A/C SNP (rs1800872) was genotyped by PCR-RFLP and the IL-10 level measured using ELISA. Although no significant difference was observed in the genotypic frequencies (P = 0.657), diabetes patients carried a significantly higher number of A alleles at the -592 position, 25.6% (P < 0.001, odds ratio 0.887, 95% CI 0.670-1.184). Significant correlations were detected in postprandial glucose levels of CC-genotype patients and controls (P = 0.025), age and waist-hip ratio of CA patients and controls (P â‰¤ 0.001), and fasting glucose (P = 0.045) and low-density lipoprotein (P = 0.049) in all patients and controls. The serum IL-10 level was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P = 0.033). The polymorphism was significantly associated with disease incidence and its biochemical manifestations.
