 INTRODUCTION: Oral hypoglycemic medications sometimes do not control type 2 diabetes well. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as adjunctive therapy might improve diabetes control through increasing serum gastrin and fasting insulin levels. METHODS: Electronic medical records in a family medicine residency program office practice were reviewed for 73 individuals with type 2 diabetes (not taking insulin), for whom PPIs were prescribed. Values for glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) for periods of time when a PPI had been prescribed were compared with HbA1c levels for periods of time with no record of PPI prescribing or over-the-counter PPI use. RESULTS: The mean HbA1c for patients not taking insulin was 7.11 during periods with recorded prescribing or over-the-counter use of PPIs, compared with 7.70 during periods without recorded PPI therapy (P = .001). Mean HbA1c for metformin monotherapy was not significantly different (6.81 with PPI vs. 7.10 without PPI; n = 16; P = .25). Mean HbA1c was significantly different for combination therapy that included metformin and/or sulfonylurea and/or giltazone (7.26 vs. 7.80; n = 27; P = .002). CONCLUSION: The observed association between PPI therapy and lower HbA1c levels suggests that PPIs may be useful as adjunctive therapy for type 2 diabetes.
