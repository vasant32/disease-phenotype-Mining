Although galanin has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle of rats, there is no literature available about the effect of galanin on Glucose Transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation from intracellular membrane pools to plasma membranes in adipocytes of type 2 diabetic rats. In the present study M35, a galanin antagonist was used to elucidate whether exercise-induced galanin release increased GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The present findings showed that plasma galanin levels after swimming training in all four trained groups were higher compared with each sedentary control. M35 treatment had an inhibitory effect on glucose infusion rates in the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp test and GLUT4 mRNA expression levels in adipocytes. Moreover, M35 treatment reduced GLUT4 concentration in both plasma membranes and total cell membranes. The ratios of GLUT4 contents in plasma membranes to total cell membranes in four drug groups were lower compared with each control. These data demonstrate a beneficial role of endogenous galanin to transfer GLUT4 from internal stores to plasma membranes in adipocytes of type 2 diabetic rats. Galanin plays a significant role in regulation of glucose metabolic homeostasis and is an important hormone relative to diabetes.
