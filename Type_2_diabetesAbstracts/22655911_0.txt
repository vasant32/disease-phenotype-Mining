Background: Several epidemiologic studies have identified a greater incidence of periodontitis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recent developments suggest that local delivery of antimicrobials into periodontal pockets improve periodontal health. The present study was designed to investigate the adjunctive effects of subgingivally delivered Azithromycin (AZM) (0.5% concentration) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) for treating chronic periodontitis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: 63 patients were categorized into two treatment groups: Group 1: SRP plus placebo gel and Group 2: SRP plus 0.5% AZM. Clinical parameters were recorded at baseline, 3, 6 and 9 months; they included marginal sulcus bleeding index (mSBI), plaque index (PI), probing depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). Results: Both therapies resulted in significant improvements. Using a subject based analysis, patients in Group 2 treated with SRP + 0.5 %AZM showed enhanced reductions in PI, GI, SBI, PD and gains in CAL (p <0.05) over a period of 9 months as compared to Group 1. Conclusion: Although both treatment strategies seemed to benefit the patients, the adjunctive use of 0.5% AZM as a controlled drug delivery system enhanced the clinical outcome.
