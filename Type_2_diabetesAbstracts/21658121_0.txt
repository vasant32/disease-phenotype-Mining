 AIMS: To investigate whether a reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease in Type 2 diabetes can be achieved in a newly recruited cohort following the recently advanced concept of multifactorial treatment and followed in primary care settings as compared with earlier cohorts. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in primary care settings at multiple clinics nationwide in the Japan Diabetes Clinical Data Management (JDDM) study group. Subjects were 2984 patients with Type 2 diabetes without prevalent cardiovascular disease. The main outcome measure was the first event of non-fatal or fatal coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke or peripheral artery disease, and the incidence was compared with other representative cohorts. RESULTS: There were 90 cardiovascular events over 10,827 person-years of follow-up with a dropout rate of 6%. The incidences (per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval) of composite, coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke and peripheral artery disease in the JDDM study were 8.3 (6.6-10.0), 4.4 (3.2-5.6), 3.1 (2.1-4.2), and 0.7 (0.2-1.2), respectively. Each incidence was lowest in the JDDM study compared with other cohorts (P < 0.01 vs. each cohort). In the JDDM study, significant variables predictive of the occurrence of a cardiovascular event were age, duration of diabetes, HbA(1c), HDL cholesterol and urinary albumin. CONCLUSION: The novel finding of low cardiovascular disease occurrence in this study may be conferred by the feasibility at primary care settings for providing patients with Type 2 diabetes with favourable control of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipids, coupled with unique ethnicity/country factors.
