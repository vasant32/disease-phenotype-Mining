 OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship of biochemical parameters, BMI and blood pressure with age, gender and ethnicity of Trinidadian type 2-diabetic subjects. METHODS: A retrospective case control study comprised of 1794 patient (740 males and 1054 females). RESULTS: The correlation was found for lipid profile with age and gender in diabetic subjects. There was a positive significant correlation in LDL-C values for all age groups. Serum creatinine concentrations significantly varied amongst ethnicity (p = 0.02). Of the known ethnicities, East Indians had the highest mean creatinine value (1.00 ± 0.47 mg/dl). The univariate general linear model showed that lipid profile had many associations with gender and ethnicity in type 2 diabetic subjects. LDL-C had significant differences between gender (p = 0.04) and diabetes (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Varied lipid profile with elevated systolic blood pressure and BMI are associated in type 2 diabetic patients with respect to age, gender and ethnicity.
