BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus, classified into types 1 and 2, is a chronic disease that shows high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. Insulin-dependent patients show a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders than do patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This research involved the participation of 200 subjects divided into 2 groups: 100 patients with diabetes type 1 and 100 patients with diabetes type 2. This study used the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for the identification of psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: Of the 200 participants, 85 (42.5%) were found to have at least 1 psychiatric disorder. The most prevalent disorders were generalized anxiety disorder (21%), dysthymia (15%), social phobia (7%), current depression (5.5%), lifelong depression (3.5%), panic disorder (2.5%), and risk of suicide (2%). Other disorders with lower prevalence were also identified. The groups showed a statistically significant difference in the presence of dysthymia, current depression, and panic disorder, which were more prevalent in patients with diabetes type 1. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of psychiatric disorders in diabetic patients points to the need for greater investment in appropriate diagnostic evaluation of patients that considers mental issues. The difference identified between the groups shows that preventive measures and therapeutic projects should consider the specific demands of each type of diabetes.
