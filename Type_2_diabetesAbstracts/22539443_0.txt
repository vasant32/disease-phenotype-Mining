Adiponectin, which is secreted by the white adipose tissue, plays an important role in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. Since 2002, many investigators explored the association between ADIPOQ single nucleotide polymorphisms and T2DM in different ethnic populations from different regions. In China, the results of numerous studies of the association between ADIPOQ and T2DM were not consistent, which may be caused by population-specific effects or environmental effects. This review describes the association between ADIPOQ and T2DM, the metabolic characteristics and the complications of T2DM in Chinese populations. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
