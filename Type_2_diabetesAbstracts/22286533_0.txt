The objective of the present cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence and the clinical and laboratory features of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) attending either an outpatient clinic or hemodialysis units. Serologic-HCV testing was performed in 489 type 2 DM patients (303 outpatients and 186 on dialysis). A structured assessment of clinical, laboratory and DM-related complications was performed and the patients were then compared according to HCV infection status. Mean patient age was 60 years; HCV positivity (HCV+) was observed in 39 of 303 (12.9%) outpatients and in 34 of 186 (18.7%) dialysis patients. Among HCV+ patients, 32 were men (43.8%). HCV+ patients had higher serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (0.90 ± 0.83 vs 0.35 ± 0.13 µKat/L), alanine aminotransferase (0.88 ± 0.93 vs 0.38 ± 0.19 µKat/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase (1.57 ± 2.52 vs 0.62 ± 0.87 µKat/L; P < 0.001), and serum iron (17.65 ± 6.68 vs 14.96 ± 4.72 µM; P = 0.011), and lower leukocyte and platelet counts (P = 0.010 and P < 0.001, respectively) than HCV-negative (HCV-) patients. HCV+ dialysis patients had higher diastolic blood pressure than HCV- patients (87.5 ± 6.7 vs 81.5 ± 6.0 mmHg; P = 0.005) and a lower prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (75 vs 92.7%; P = 0.007). In conclusion, our study showed that HCV is common among subjects with type 2 DM but is not associated with a higher prevalence of chronic diabetic complications.
