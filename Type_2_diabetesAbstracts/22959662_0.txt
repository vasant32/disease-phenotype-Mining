We investigated how liver fat content (LFC) influences cholesterol metabolism by quantifying liver fat using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and by measuring the serum concentrations of lathosterol, a marker of cholesterol synthesis, and sitosterol and campesterol, two markers of cholesterol absorption. We also evaluated whether this relationship could be modified by statin therapy. The study was conducted in 263 patients with type 2 diabetes, 137 of whom (52.0%) received statin therapy. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients (62.7%) had steatosis (LFC>5.5%). We performed specific analyses in patients without statin therapy and in patients treated with statin therapy. In both groups, the lathosterol to cholesterol ratio correlated positively with LFC, and in multivariate analysis, the lathosterol to cholesterol ratio was associated with LFC independently of age, gender and BMI. Sitosterol and campesterol concentrations were not associated with LFC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that in patients with type 2 diabetes, LFC is associated with an increase in cholesterol synthesis that is independent of obesity or diabetes mellitus. Statin therapy does not modify this relationship.
