 OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of meal timing on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor vildagliptin in Japanese patients with Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this open-label, single-center crossover study, 12 Japanese patients with Type 2 diabetes were randomized to twice-daily vildagliptin 50 mg, administered 30 min before or immediately before breakfast and dinner for 7 days. After a 7-day washout period, patients received the other regimen. Blood samples were collected for the determination of vildagliptin, DPP-4, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose. RESULTS: Vildagliptin absorption appeared slower when administered 30 min before rather than immediately before meals (tmax absolute range: 1.00 - 2.00 h vs. 0.33 - 1.58 h). Vildagliptin Cmax and AUC0-8 h were essentially the same irrespective of meal timing (geometric mean ratio: Cmax 1.08 (90% CI; 0.92 - 1.26); AUC0-8 h 0.97 (90% CI; 0.91 - 1.05)). Meal timing did not affect pharmacodynamics; complete DPP-4 inhibition (> 90%) was sustained for 8 h post-dose, and plasma active glucagon-like peptide-1 levels increased 2 - 3-fold from baseline. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPPG) reductions from baseline did not differ significantly with meal timing (30 min before vs. immediately before: FPG, -8.9 vs. -5.8 mg/dl; adjusted AUE0-4 h, -67.0 vs. -51.0 mg√óh/dl). Vildagliptin was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Dosing 30 min or immediately before meals did not affect vildagliptin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics in Japanese patients with Type 2 diabetes.
