Our previous studies have shown that the best compatibility of components in Corni Fructus (PC) had a protective effect on vascular endothelial cells. In this study, the effect of PC on WT1 expression in glomerular podocytes and the mechanism of PC on early nephropathy in type 2 diabetic rats have been investigated. Type 2 diabetic rats were generated by high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ), then fed aminoguanidine (100 mg/kg), glimepiride (0.4 mg/kg), low-dose (60 mg/kg) or high-dose (120 mg/kg) of PC once a day for 12 weeks. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was examined regularly. Insulin (INS) was measured by a radioimmunoassay. Microalbuminuria (mALB) was measured by an ELISA assay. Urinary creatinine (UCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and N-acetyl-Î²-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) were measured by colorimetric assays. Renal morphological changes were observed by optical microscopy. The expression index of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1EI) in glomeruli was examined by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that PC led to a decrease in FBG (p < 0.01), NAG (p < 0.05) and mALB (p < 0.05) and an increase in INS (p < 0.01) and WT1EI (p < 0.05) compared to the diabetic group. PC could improve renal damage and greatly reduce the renal morphology score (p < 0.05). These results suggested that PC had the protective effect on early nephropathy in type 2 diabetic rats, which was closely related to the regulation of podocytes.
