 BACKGROUND: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) has been proposed for the diagnosis of diabetes. However, several countries have not incorporated its use for this purpose yet and there is no consensus on a suitable cut-off point of HbA(1c) for the diagnosis of diabetes. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic characteristics of HbA(1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for the assessment of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: FPG, HbA(1c), and creatinine levels were assessed in 47 patients with type 2 diabetes and 46 healthy controls. RESULTS: The areas under the curve for HbA(1c) > or = 6.5% and FPG > or = 7.0 mmol/L were 0.97 and 0.92, respectively. HbA(1c). has a slightly higher ability to discriminate type 2 diabetes compared with FPG. The association between HbA(1c) and type 2 diabetes was independent of gender, age, hypertension, smoking, and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: HbA(1c) was able to be used for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
