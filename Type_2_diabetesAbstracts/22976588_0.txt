BACKGROUND: Early detection to identify people at risk of diabetes is an important approach to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to implement the Diabetes Prevention Program in community pharmacy using a diabetes risk prediction tool. METHODS: The program was conducted in seven pharmacies in Bangkok, Thailand. Participants were the pharmacy's clients aged ≥35 years without the history of diabetes. A validated risk prediction tool was used to assess individuals' diabetes risk. Educational information was offered to all participants. Those with a high risk score (≥9 out of 17) were offered a self-check of fasting capillary blood glucose (CBG). A referral was made for those with CBG ≥126 mg/dl. RESULTS: During a 3-month service, 397 individuals participated in the program. Nearly half of the participants (49.4%) were at a high risk of diabetes (risk score: ≥9). Ninety five (48.5%) of these high risk individuals undertook fasting CBG. Elevated fasting CBG (≥126 mg/dl) was found in 12 persons (12.7%). Overall, two patients with diabetes were identified during the provision of the program. CONCLUSIONS: The Diabetes Prevention Program in community pharmacies uncovered half of the clients who were at risk of diabetes and provided an opportunity for participants to learn more about the prevention of diabetes.
