This was a nested sub-study of a randomised placebo-controlled trial of the effect of 6 months of treatment with rosiglitazone added to existing therapy on myocardial triglyceride (mTG) content in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD) or at least one additional risk factor. The primary endpoint, mTG content, was measured with cardiac (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Of the 99 randomised participants selected for the imaging sub-study, 49 (48%) had complete and interpretable spectroscopy data (age = 58 years, duration of T2D = 9.5 years; 57% women and 69% non-white). There was no significant change in mTG in either group (-0.1 ± 0.6% and -0.05 ± 0.8% respectively) and the changes in mTG were not associated with changes in left ventricular structure or function. Compared with placebo, treatment with rosiglitazone for 6 months had no discernible effect on mTG or left ventricular function in this population with long-standing diabetes and CVD.
