 OBJECTIVES: There is controversial evidence regarding the levels of antioxidant molecules in type 2 diabetes periodontitis patients. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in the gingival tissue of poorly and well-controlled type 2 diabetic subjects with chronic periodontitis (CP). DESIGN: Gingival biopsies were harvested from systemically and periodontally healthy subjects (n=12), systemically healthy subjects with CP (n=15), well-controlled (n=8) and poorly controlled (n=14) diabetic subjects with CP. The messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of peroxiredoxin (PRDX) 1 and 2, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 and 2 were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: The results showed that PRDX1 and GPX1 were up-regulated by periodontitis (p<0.05), independently of the glycaemic status, whilst PRDX2 and SOD2 genes were slightly influenced by periodontitis, but significantly induced when periodontitis was associated with DM, especially under a poor glycaemic control (p<0.05). Moreover, CAT and SOD1 expressions were not significantly influenced by any of these inflammatory disorders (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, both PRDX1 and GPX1 were overexpressed in CP whilst PRDX2 and SOD2 were up-regulated especially in the poorly controlled diabetic group with CP.
