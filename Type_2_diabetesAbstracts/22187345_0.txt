Adiponectin, an adipose-derived plasma protein, is reduced in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Thiazolidinediones can increase adiponectin levels and improve insulin sensitivity. This study investigated the associations between type 2 diabetes and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the adiponectin (45T/G) and adiponectin receptor-2 gene (795G/A), and investigated whether these genetic variants affect the response to pioglitazone in Iranian patients with type 2 diabetes. We genotyped 128 non-diabetic participants and 101 patients with type 2 diabetes for 45T/G and 795G/A with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays. Patients were treated with pioglitazone for 12 weeks, after which we compared laboratory parameters in these two groups. Fasting blood sugar differed significantly in individuals with different 795G/A genotypes after pioglitazone treatment (P = 0.009). The mean decrease in insulin/glucose ratio after treatment also differed significantly in individuals with different 45T/G genotypes (P = 0.035). The T allele frequency for 45T/G was 87.11% in controls versus 81.68% in patients (P = 0.071). The TG and GG genotypes were more frequent in patients (P = 0.032). The G allele frequency for 795G/A was 76.17% in controls versus 80.20% in patients (P = 0.179). 795G/A variants were not significantly different between patient and control group. The adiponectin gene 45T/G mutation may be an important determinant of type 2 diabetes in the Iranian population. However, adiponectin 45T/G and adiponectin receptor-2 795G/A polymorphisms were not significantly associated with the response to pioglitazone in our sample.
