Glucose lowering should be approached by managing overall cardiovascular risk. Glycemic goals should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, preexisting cardiovascular disease, age, and life expectancy. Intensive glycemic control has consistently been shown to produce a substantial benefit for preventing long-term microvascular complications in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in patients with diabetes, microvascular complications cause substantial morbidity and disability. Thus, it is apparent that additional strategies on multimodal treatment options are necessary to promote effective management and prevention of diabetic complications.
