 UNLABELLED: Diabetic nephropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes. Symptom of nephropathy is albuminuria, in which the mechanism of formation may participates CRP and IL-6. The aim of the study was to evaluate the concentrations of CRP and IL-6 depending on the irregularity of metabolic patients with type 2 diabetes and their impact on the occurrence of albuminuria. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted among 68 patients with type 2 diabetes with albuminuria. Patients were divided into groups: group I - patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c > or = 6.1 - < or = 6.5%, group II - patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c > 6.5 - < or = 10.0%, K - control group, 21 patients with essential hypertension with albuminuria. The material was consisted of venal extracted for clot drawn from the basilic vain. IL 6 concentration was assessed using the ELISA method. The percentage of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), CRP, the extent of albuminuria was determined by immunoturbidimetric method. RESULTS: The mean urinary albumin excretion was highest in the second study group, lowerin the test group, the lowest in the control group. The average concentration of IL-6 and CRP was highest in group I, lower in group II, the lowest in the control group (p > 0.05). It has been shown a positive correlation between serum CRP and the magnitude of albuminuria in the test group of patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c > or = 6.1 - < or = 6.5% (p < 0.037). The relationship between serum CRP and the magnitude of albuminuria in the control group of patients with essential hypertension were at the border of statistical significance (p < 0.057). Not shown a positive correlation between these parameters in the second group of patients with type 2 diabetes with HbA1c >6.5 - < or = 10.0%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes with better metabolic control, protein CRP is a sensitive marker of albuminuria.
