 AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We investigated the contribution of AGEs to the impairment of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) variables in diabetic individuals and in two animal models of diabetic obesity and of renal impairment. METHODS: The capacity of plasma and HDL from 26 individuals with moderately controlled type 2 diabetes to support cholesterol efflux was compared with 26 age- and sex-matched individuals without diabetes. We also compared the rates of RCT in vivo in two animal models: db/db mice and mice with chronic renal failure. RESULTS: Diabetic individuals had characteristic dyslipidaemia and higher levels of plasma AGEs. The capacity of whole plasma, ApoB-depleted plasma and isolated HDL to support cholesterol efflux was greater for diabetic patients compared with controls despite their lower HDL-cholesterol levels. The capacity of plasma to support cholesterol efflux correlated with plasma levels of cholesteryl ester transfer protein and levels of ApoB, but not with levels of AGE. RCT was severely impaired in db/db mice despite elevated HDL-cholesterol levels and no change in AGE concentration, whereas RCT in uraemic mice was unaffected despite elevated AGE levels. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: AGEs are unlikely to contribute significantly to the impairment of RCT in type 2 diabetes.
