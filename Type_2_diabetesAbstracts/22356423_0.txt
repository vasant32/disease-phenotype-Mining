 AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether increased apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio is associated with Type 2 diabetes mellitus independent of other risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 70,063 subjects (41,391 men and 28,672 women; mean age 41.5 years) who visited the Health Screening Center at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital for a routine medical check-up between January 2009 and December 2009 were enrolled in this study. RESULTS: The mean apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio in the study subjects was 0.66 Â± 0.18. The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increased across the apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio quartiles (1.0%, 1.6%, 2.9%, and 4.8% for the 1st through 4th quartiles, respectively, P < 0.001) and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) also showed an increasing tendency by quartile (P < 0.001). The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio was correlated with age, adiposity, blood pressure, HOMA2-IR value, fasting glucose levels, and other inflammatory marker, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and lipoprotein (a) levels (all P < 0.001). In a multiple logistic regression model, the highest apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio quartile was associated with Type 2 diabetes, even after controlling for other risk factors for diabetes, such as age, gender, BMI, systolic blood pressure, HOMA2-IR values, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, family history of diabetes, presence of metabolic syndrome, and conventional lipid parameters (odds ratio 1.31; 95% confidence interval 1.17-1.46, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio was found to be associated with Type 2 diabetes independent of other risk factors for diabetes and conventional lipid parameters.
