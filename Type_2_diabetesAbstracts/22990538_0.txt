Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate histological changes that occur in the periodontium of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus without signs of periodontal disease and to establish the influence of this systemic condition upon periodontal structures. Materials and Methods: Gingival tissue samples were obtained from 12 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 10 healthy adults, as control group. The specimens were examined using standard dyes as Hematoxylin and Eosin and PAS-Alcian stain, by a microscope with different magnifications. Results: Our results showed that periodontal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by significant inflammation, affecting both epithelial and connective tissues, with degeneration of dermal papilla, increase in number of inflammatory cells, destruction of reticular fibers and accumulation of dense collagen fibers (fibrosis). Conclusions: Within the limits of this study, diabetic subjects presented distortion in periodontal attachment, with changes in both epithelial and connective tissues, when compared to the healthy controls, suggesting that diabetes mellitus has an independent effect on periodontal tissue. This effect is observed in both groups, so that we considered it to be independent of the periodontal condition.
