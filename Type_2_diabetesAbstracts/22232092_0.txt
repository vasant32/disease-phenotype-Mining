Diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, is on the rise throughout the United States. Several national health organizations and professional medical societies advocate screening people in high-risk groups for diabetes. However, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening only adults with hypertension. We examined evidence supporting screening high-risk adults, including studies using intermediate outcomes and modeling studies. We found a broad range of evidence of practical relevance to diabetes screening that merits consideration in developing new screening guidelines. This evidence could inform recommendations to expand coverage to screening of other high-risk groups and could facilitate the prevention and early treatment of diabetes. We recommend that the US Preventive Services Task Force consider these expanded sources of evidence and revise its recommendations accordingly.
