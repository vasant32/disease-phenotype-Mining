 PURPOSE: To investigate whether plasma pentosidine, a well-defined advanced glycation end product, is associated with retinal hemodynamic abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Forty-two eyes with type 2 diabetes mellitus were evaluated. The type 2 diabetic eyes were divided into 2 groups: 22 eyes (22 patients; mean age, 61 years) with nondiabetic retinopathy (NDR) and 20 eyes (20 patients; mean age, 61 years) with mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). We used a retinal laser Doppler system to measure the arterial diameter, velocity, and blood flow in the major temporal retinal arteries. The pulsatility ratio, a resistive index expressed as the peak systolic to the end diastolic velocity ratio, was calculated from the blood velocity traces. Plasma pentosidine was measured in 42 patients with diabetes using a commercially available competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The pulsatility ratio significantly increased in patients with NPDR (4.8 ± 1.5) compared with patients with NDR (3.7 ± 0.8) (P = .0061). No differences in velocity, diameter, or blood flow were seen between the 2 groups. Plasma pentosidine levels also increased significantly (P = .0085) in patients with NPDR (0.057 ± 0.015) compared to patients with NDR (0.047 ± 0.012). The pulsatility ratio was correlated positively with the plasma pentosidine levels in patients with NPDR (Pearson correlation, r = 0.45, P = .044). Multiple regression analysis showed that the plasma pentosidine level was significantly associated with the pulsatility ratio (standardized coefficient, 0.62; P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: The vascular rigidity of the retinal arteries may increase with increasing plasma pentosidine in patients with type 2 diabetes with retinopathy.
