Type 1 diabetes remains the predominant form of diabetes in the pediatric population, while the incidence of type 2 diabetes has increased, paralleling the increase in obesity. Another form of diabetes, Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), should also be considered especially in those whose clinical presentation is atypical for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Although testing for MODY is a challenge, testing in appropriate patients and family members should be standard of care. Knowledge of the genetic etiology of the type of diabetes will enable appropriate treatment and optimize outcomes, allow more accurate prediction of disease progression, as well as allow screening for and the diagnosis of MODY in family members.
