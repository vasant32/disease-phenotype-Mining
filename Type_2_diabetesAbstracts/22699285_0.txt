 OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) and mitral annulus calcification (MAC) with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic individuals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 902 type 2 diabetic outpatients, who had undergone a transthoracic echocardiography for clinical reasons during the years 1992-2007. AVS and MAC were diagnosed by echocardiography, and a heart valve calcium (HVC) score was calculated by summing up the AVS and MAC variables. The study outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: At baseline, 477 (52.9%) patients had no heart valves affected (HVC-0), 304 (33.7%) had one valve affected (HVC-1), and 121 (13.4%) had both valves affected (HVC-2). During a mean follow-up of 9 years, 137 (15.2%) patients died, 78 of them from cardiovascular causes. Compared with patients with HVC-0, those with HVC-2 had the highest risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, whereas those with HVC-1 had an intermediate risk (P < 0.0001 by the log-rank test). After adjustment for sex, age, BMI, systolic blood pressure, diabetes duration, A1C, LDL cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate, smoking, history of myocardial infarction, and use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs, the hazard ratio of all-cause mortality was 2.3 (95% CI 1.1-4.9; P < 0.01) for patients with HVC-1 and 9.3 (3.9-17.4; P < 0.001) for those with HVC-2. Similar results were found for cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that AVS and MAC, singly or in combination, are independently associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetic patients.
