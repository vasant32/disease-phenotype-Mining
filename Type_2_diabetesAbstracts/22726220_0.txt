AIMS: Evaluate anti-interleukin-1β (IL-1β) antibody, canakinumab, in patients with type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in whom hyperglycemia may trigger IL-1β-associated inflammation leading to suppressed insulin secretion and β-cell dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This 4-week, parallel-group study randomized 190 patients with type 2 diabetes 2:1, canakinumab vs. placebo, into the following treatment arms: metformin monotherapy, metformin+sulfonylurea, metformin+sulfonylurea+thiazolidinedione or insulin±metformin. IGT population (n=54) was randomized 1:1, canakinumab vs. placebo. Primary efficacy assessment was change from baseline in insulin secretion rate (ISR) relative to glucose 0-2h. RESULTS: Mean changes from baseline to week 4 in ISR relative to glucose at 0-2h or other time points were not statistically significant for canakinumab vs. placebo across groups. ISR (relative to glucose) at 0-0.5h (first-phase insulin secretion) numerically favored canakinumab vs. placebo in insulin-treated patients (difference in mean change from baseline (point estimate [PE]) 3.81 pmol/min/m(2) /mmol/L; P=0.0525) and in the IGT group (PE 3.92 pmol/min/m(2) /mmol/L; P=0.1729). Mean change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose favored canakinumab in the type 2 diabetes/metformin group and the IGT group; however, differences were not statistically significant. Mean change from baseline in peak insulin level and insulin AUC 0-4h were statistically significantly higher in the canakinumab group in IGT patients. Canakinumab was well tolerated and consistent with known safety experience. CONCLUSIONS: The trend toward improving ISR relative to glucose 0-0.5h in patients treated with insulin supports the hypothesis that insulin secretion can be improved by blocking IL-1β.
