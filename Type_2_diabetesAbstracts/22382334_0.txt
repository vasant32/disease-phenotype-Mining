We examined the bone mineral density (BMD) of the proximal region and the mid-diaphysis of the femur using dual energy X-ray absorption (DXA), the blood osteocalcin level and the blood glucose level every five weeks from 8 to 23 weeks old in KK-Ay diabetic mice. The BMD of the proximal region after 18 weeks old was significantly lower when compared with that at 8 weeks old (p<0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in the BMD of the mid-diaphysis at each week. The BMD of the proximal region at 18 weeks old was significantly lower than that in ddY mice, used as controls (p<0.05). The blood osteocalcin level at 18 weeks old was significantly lower than that at 8 weeks old and that in 18-week-old ddY mice (p<0.05). There was significant negative correlation between the blood glucose level and the BMD of the proximal region (r=-0.64, p<0.05). These results suggest that type 2 diabetes exerts an influence only on spongy bone, not on cortical bone, and that the BMD in the proximal region of the femur seems to be affected by blood glucose level, parallel with the progression of diabetes, through the blood osteocalcin level. In the present study, we show the characteristics of diabetic osteopenia in KK-Ay mice, an animal model of type 2 diabetes.
