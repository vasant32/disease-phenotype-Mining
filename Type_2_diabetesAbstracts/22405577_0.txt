The majority of Western countries have reported large falls in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) mortality rates since the 1970s. Yet since the 1980s, they have also experienced two-fold or three-fold increases in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes--both considered substantial risk factors for CVD. So why have these increasing risks apparently not impacted on CVD mortality falls? This viewpoint outlines the main factors involved; examines recent trends and apparent contradictions; offers some explanations for the trends; discusses how more usefully complex epidemiological models might lead to clearer evidence; offers some explanations for the trends; and explores the implications for CVD prevention.
