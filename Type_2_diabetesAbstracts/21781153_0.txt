 AIMS: To investigate whether a positive family history of diabetes is associated with the effectiveness of lifestyle counselling on cardio-metabolic risk factors and glucose tolerance status in a 1-year follow-up in a cohort of Finnish men and women at high risk for Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Altogether, 10,149 individuals who had high risk of Type 2 diabetes participated in the implementation programme of the national diabetes prevention programme at baseline. One-year follow-up data were available for 2798 individuals without diabetes. Family history of diabetes was based on self-report. Lifestyle interventions were individual or groups sessions on lifestyle changes. The effectiveness of lifestyle intervention was measured as changes in cardiovascular risk factors, glucose tolerance status and incidence of Type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Family history was associated with the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention in men, but not in women. During the 1-year follow-up, body weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and score for 10-year risk for fatal cardiovascular disease (SCORE) decreased and glucose tolerance status improved more in men without a family history of diabetes than in men with a family history of diabetes. Of the participating men and women, 10% and 5% developed Type 2 diabetes, respectively. Family history was not related to the incidence of Type 2 diabetes in either gender. CONCLUSIONS: Men without a family history of diabetes were more successful in responding to lifestyle counselling with regard to cardio-metabolic measurements and glucose tolerance than those with a family history of diabetes. Similar results were not seen in women. In keeping with findings from earlier studies, the prevention of Type 2 diabetes is not influenced by a family history of diabetes.
