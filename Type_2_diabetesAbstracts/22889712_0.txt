The objective of this observational study was to quantify the incidence of urinary tract infections (UTI) among diabetes patients and compare this risk to patients without diabetes. Type 2 diabetes patients and a matched sample of patients without diabetes were identified from GPRD. Patients were followed for 1-year from their study index date until the first record of a UTI or a censored event. The incidence of UTI was 46.9 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI) 45.8-48.1) among diabetes patients and 29.9 (95% CI 28.9-30.8) for patients without diabetes. Compared to the non-diabetes patients, the risk of UTI was 1.53 (95% CI 1.46-1.59) for all diabetes patients; and 2.08 (95% CI 1.93-2.24) for patients with previously diagnosed diabetes. In general practice, across gender and age, the risk of developing a UTI is higher for patients with type 2 diabetes compared to patients without diabetes.
