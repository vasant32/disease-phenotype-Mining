 BACKGROUND: Anemia is common among patients with type 2 diabetes. We determined whether type 2 diabetic patients significantly differed in erythrocyte mechanical fragility as compared with nondiabetic subjects. METHODS: We recruited 25 Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes (14 men and 11 women; mean age 58±8 years) and 25 age-, race- and sex-matched nondiabetic individuals. The fragility of erythrocytes was tested by inducing mechanical hemolysis by double aspiration of K(2)EDTA blood through a 0.5 mL insulin syringe equipped with a very thin needle. The plasma was then separated from the blood cells by centrifugation at 2000 xg for 15 min at room temperature. A Beckman Coulter DxC 800 was used to measure the hemolysis index by direct spectrophotometry. RESULTS: Compared with matched nondiabetic controls, type 2 diabetic patients had a significantly increased mechanical fragility of erythrocytes (hemolysis index ratio 21±13 vs. 14±10, p=0.02). Univariable linear regression analysis revealed that there was a strong positive association between percent hemolysis and fasting plasma glucose (r=0.669, p<0.001) and hemoglobin A1c (r=0.549, p<0.005) in type 2 diabetic subjects, but not in matched nondiabetic controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patients with type 2 diabetes have a significantly higher erythrocyte mechanical fragility than matched nondiabetic subjects, and that fasting plasma glucose is the strongest correlate of increased mechanical fragility of erythrocytes in this patients group.
