 OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between glycated albumin (GA) level and pancreatic β cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics. METHODS: The subjects sought the confirmation of diabetes diagnosis or underwent diabetes screening tests in high-risk patients from January 2008 to October 2010. All of them underwent 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin releasing test. The levels of GA and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were analyzed by liquid enzymatic method and high performance liquid chromatography respectively. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to evaluate the basal insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and pancreatic β cell function (HOMA-β). ΔI30/ΔG30 was used to evaluate early-phase insulin secretion after a glucose load. RESULTS: (1) Among 500 type 2 diabetics according to the diagnostic criteria of WHO (1999), 279 were males and 221 were females. Average age was 56.3 ± 12.3, GA (21.1 ± 5.4)% and HbA1c (7.0 ± 1.3)%. (2) A significantly positive relationship was shown between HbA1c and GA (r = 0.691, P < 0.01). GA was also positively correlated with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 0.5 hPG, 1 hPG, 2 hPG and 3 hPG after a glucose load of OGTT test (r = 0.511 - 0.627, P < 0.01). (3) GA was negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.112, P < 0.01), HOMA-β (r = -0.350, P < 0.01) and ΔI30/ΔG30 (r = -0.263, P < 0.01). (4) Multivariant stepwise regression analysis showed that HbA1c, FPG, 3 hPG and ΔI30/ΔG30 were independent factors of GA level. CONCLUSION: Glycated albumin level is closely correlated with the function of early-phase insulin secretion in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics.
