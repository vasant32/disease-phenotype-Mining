 BACKGROUND: Glycaemic control is fundamental to the management of and risk reduction in microvascular complications of diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of sleep quality with glycaemic control and its impact on type 2 diabetic patients in an Asian population. METHODS: A total of 46 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled. HbA1C was measured in each patient, and each patient completed the Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Good sleep quality was defined as PSQI score â‰¤5. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender and body mass index, the total PSQI score and sleep efficiency (P < 0.05) were significantly correlated with the level of HbA1C. Logistic regression analysis showed the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of sleep efficiency for HbA1C level was 6.83 [OR = 6.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.04-22.8, P = 0.002]. The adjusted ORs of worse glycaemic control for the poor sleep quality group was 6.94 with regard to the group of good sleep quality (OR = 6.94, 95% CI: 1.02-47.16, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that both poor sleep quality and less-efficient sleep are significantly correlated with worse glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings are expected to contribute to the prevention and risk reduction of microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes.
