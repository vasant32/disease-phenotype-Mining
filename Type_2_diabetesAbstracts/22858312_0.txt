AIM: In the present study we investigated the association between genetic polymorphisms with functional effects on redox regulation: Val16Ala of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), polymorphic deletions of glutathione S-transferases M1 (GSTM1) and T1 (GSTT1) and Ile105Val of glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) and myocardial infarction (MI) in a group of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The study population consisted of 463 Caucasian subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus of more than 10 years' duration: 206 patients with MI and 257 patients with no history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and with multiplex PCR. RESULTS: The genotype distributions of tested single nucleotide polymorphisms did not show significant difference between cases and controls. After adjustment for age, gender, smoking, BMI, duration of diabetes and lipid parameters carriers of GSTM1/GSTT1-null haplotype showed an increased risk for MI (OR=3.22, 95% CI 1.37-5.04, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The GSTM1/GSTT1 haplotype might be a genetic risk factor for MI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
