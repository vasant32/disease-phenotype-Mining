 UNLABELLED: Periodontitis is a frequent pathologic condition in diabetic patient, and has been associated with chronic complications like nephropathy, cardiovascular disease, peripheral artery disease or death. OBJECTIVE: To document the association between severe periodontitis and edentulism with the presence of sensory-motor neuropathy in diabetic patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Cross-sectional study in type 2 diabetic patients from the family medicine unit no. 27 of the IMSS in Tijuana, MÃ©xico. Patients were evaluated to identify periodontitis and sensory-motor neuropathy. Information was also obtained about sex, age, duration of diabetes, glycemic control, smoking and alcohol use. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-six patients completed all measurements. In 180 (41.3%) neuropathy was identified, and associated with age (p < 0.001); duration of diabetes (p < 0.001); fasting glucose (p < 0.001); severe periodontitis (OR: 2.7; IC 95%: 1.5-4.8);and with edentulism (OR: 4.4; IC 95%: 2.0-9.4). Logistic regression multivariable analysis kept as significative the association between severe periodontitis and edentulism with neuropathy (adjusted OR: 1.7; IC 95%: 1.1-2.6). CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis and edentulism are associated with the presence of neuropathy in diabetic patients.
