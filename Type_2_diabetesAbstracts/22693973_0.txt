 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We designed this study to observe the DM prevalence, insulin resistance, beta cell reserve and the interaction of these parameters in the first degree relatives of Type 2 diabetic patients in Turkish population. METHODS: 125 subjects were included in the study. 25 subjects without the first degree diabetic relatives were selected as the control group; they were matched by age, BMI, socio-economical, cultural and environmental factors. (OGTT), (IVGTT), (GST), and (ITT), were performed on all subjects and controls. RESULTS: 12 (9.6 %) DM and 23 (18. 4 %) impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) cases of 125 subjects were diagnosed according to OGTT results. The mean BMI of diabetic subjects was significantly higher than of controls and subjects with normal glucose tolerance (p<0.05). When compared to the control group, the mean AUCinsulin levels were significantly lower in diabetic subjects (p<0.05). To observe the correlation between HOMAIR and KITT values, a statistically significant correlation was found (p<0.05, r: 0.222). There was a deficiency in the C-peptide response to glucagon stimulation in diabetic relatives (p<0.05, F: 4.59 One Way ANOVA). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the first degree relatives of Type 2 diabetic patients constitute a high risk group for DM, IGT and insulin resistance by using four different tests in Turkish population.The significant finding(s) of the study: We demonstrated a high prevalence of glucose metabolism disorders in the relatives of type 2 diabetic patients.This study adds our knowledge; insulin resistance and decreased beta cell reserve occur before diabetes mellitus begin in relatives (Tab. 5, Ref. 42).
