 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of magnesium intake on expression of insulin receptor in type 2 diabetes rats. METHODS: The models of type 2 diabetes rats were established by feeding with high-fat-diet and injecting streptozotocin (STZ). Rats were randomly assigned to four groups. The high-fat-diets were administrated magnesium at a dose of 2000 (high magnesium group), 1000 (medium magnesium group) and 200 (low magnesium group). Model control group was only fed with high-fat-diet. Normal control group was fed with common diet. Rats ate freely for four weeks. Fasting blood glucose was detected by glucose oxidase method.. Insulin was detected by radio-immunity method. The expression levels of IR of pancreas and skeletal muscle were detected by immunohistochemistry method. RESULTS: The immunohistochemistry pictures were analyzed by Image-Pro Plus. Compared with model control group, the expression levels of IR of pancreas and skeletal muscle were 0.341 +/- 0.001 and 0.346 +/- 0.002, increased and fasting blood glucose decreased significantly in high magnesium group (P < 0.05 ). CONCLUSION: Magnesium intake may increase the expression levels of IR of pancreas and skeletal muscle, and decrease fasting blood glucose in type 2 diabetes rats.
