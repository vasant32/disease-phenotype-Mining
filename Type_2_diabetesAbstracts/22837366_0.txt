OBJECTIVETo examine whether baseline pulse pressure (PP), a marker of arterial stiffness, is associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation (AF) in type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSA total of 350 type 2 diabetic patients, who were free from AF at baseline, were followed for 10 years. A standard electrocardiogram was performed annually and a diagnosis of incident AF was confirmed in affected participants by a single cardiologist.RESULTSDuring the follow-up, 32 patients (9.1% of total) developed incident AF. After adjustments for age, sex, BMI, diabetes duration, presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension treatment, kidney dysfunction, and pre-existing history of coronary heart disease, heart failure, and mild valvular disease, baseline PP was associated with an increased incidence of AF (adjusted odds ratio 1.76 for each SD increment [95% CI 1.1-2.8]; P < 0.01).CONCLUSIONSOur findings suggest that increased PP independently predicts incident AF in patients with type 2 diabetes.
