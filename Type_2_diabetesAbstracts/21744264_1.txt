The relation of Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the adiponectin locus (+45T/G and +276G/T) with coronary artery disease (CAD) is controversial. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the genetic influence of the adiponectin gene polymorphisms in the development of CAD among patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). The adiponectin genotypes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis (PCR-RFLP) in our patients. Two adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) SNPs (i.e. SNPs +45T>G and +276G>T) were genotyped in 114 Type 2 diabetic subjects with CAD, and 127 Type 2 diabetic patients without CAD. Demographic and anthropometric data along with plasma biochemistry including lipids, glycemic indices, and adiponectin were collected. There was a significant difference in the distribution of genotypes of +45T/G and +276G/T between CAD and non-CAD individuals (P < 0.05). Based on our results SNP+276G>T is associated with decreased risk of CAD after adjustment for potential confounding factors [adjusted OR = 0.39 (95%CI: 0.22-0.68); P = 0.001]. Similar findings were not observed for the +45T>G SNP. Two haplotypes 45T-276T and 45G-276T were associated with a decreased risk of CAD [adjusted OR = 0.47 (95% CI: 0.32-0.94); P = 0.03 and adjusted OR = 0.33 (95% CI: 0.13-0.83); P = 0.02 respectively]. No significant difference was observed between HOMA-IR, BMI, waist circumference, history of hypertension, HbA1C, and lipid concentrations regarding the two SNPs. In conclusion, these findings suggest that T allele of +276G>T SNP is significantly associated with decreased risk of CAD in T2D Patients. Also Haplotype analysis showed that two haplotypes 45T-276T and 45G-276T were associated with a decreased risk of CAD.
