Heart failure and diabetes are chronic conditions that frequently concur in the same patient. DM2 is a known risk factor for the development of heart failure and is related with a worse outcome. Some studies have found that heart failure is also associated with a greater incidence of diabetes. This relationship has been less studied and the mechanisms underneath this association are not fully understood. We have done a review of the literature in search for studies that evaluate the relationship between heart failure, insulin resistance and the development of type 2 diabetes, as well as the possible mechanisms leading to this situation, such as sympathetic hyperactivation, increased concentration of free fatty acids and adiponectin resistance.
