Diet and medical treatment are the standard treatment for type 2 diabetes. In obese subjects with type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery is effective in resolving diabetes. Two clinical trials comparing bariatric surgery to medical treatment were evaluated. Both the Surgical Treatment And Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial (laparoscopic Roux-En Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy) and the DIet and medical therapy versus BAriatric SurgerY in type 2 diabetes (DIBASY) trial (laparoscopic gastric bypass and biliopancreatic-diversion) showed that surgery was more effective than medical care in resolving or managing type 2 diabetes. Larger studies, or a compilation of studies, are needed to determine whether one of these procedures is better, or if they are all similarly effective, and this should also be weighed against the risk of the operations.
