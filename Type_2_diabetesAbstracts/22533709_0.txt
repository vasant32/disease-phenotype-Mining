 UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has been implicated in the cardiac and kidney complications of type 2 diabetes, and the CTGF -945 G/C polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to systemic sclerosis, a disease characterised by tissue fibrosis. This study investigated the association of the CTGF -945 G/C promoter variant with cardiac complications (left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic and systolic dysfunction) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The CTGF -945 G/C polymorphism (rs6918698) was examined in 495 Caucasian subjects with type 2 diabetes. Cardiac structure and function were assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. Kidney function was assessed using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria, and CKD defined as the presence of kidney damage (decreased kidney function (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) or albuminuria). RESULTS: The mean age ± SD of the cohort was 62 ± 14 years, with a body mass index (BMI) of 31 ± 6 kg/m2 and median diabetes duration of 11 years [25th, 75th interquartile range; 5, 18]. An abnormal echocardiogram was present in 73% of subjects; of these, 8% had LVH alone, 74% had diastolic dysfunction and 18% had systolic ± diastolic dysfunction. CKD was present in 42% of subjects. There were no significant associations between the CTGF -945 G/C polymorphism and echocardiographic parameters of LV mass or cardiac function, or kidney function both before and after adjustment for covariates of age, gender, BMI, blood pressure and hypertension. CTGF -945 genotypes were not associated with the cardiac complications of LVH, diastolic or systolic dysfunction, nor with CKD. CONCLUSIONS: In Caucasians with type 2 diabetes, genetic variation in the CTGF -945 G/C polymorphism is not associated with cardiac or kidney complications.
