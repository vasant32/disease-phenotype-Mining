Diabetes mellitus has become one of the most common chronic diseases, thereby posing a major challenge to global health. Characterized by high levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia), diabetes usually results from a loss of insulin-producing Î²-cells in the pancreas, leading to a deficiency of insulin (type 1 diabetes), or loss of insulin sensitivity (type 2 diabetes). Both types of diabetes have serious secondary complications, such as microvascular abnormalities, cardiovascular dysfunction, and kidney failure. Various complex factors, such as genetic and environmental factors, are associated with the pathophysiology of diabetes. Over the past two decades, the role of small, single-stranded noncoding microRNAs in various metabolic disorders, especially diabetes mellitus and its complications, has gained widespread attention in the scientific community. Discovered first as an endogenous regulator of development in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, these small RNAs post-transcriptionally suppress mRNA target expression. In this review, we discuss the potential roles of different microRNAs in diabetes and diabetes-related complications.
