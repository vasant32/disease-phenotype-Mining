 AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine whether percutaneous electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) attenuates postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Eleven patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two experimental sessions; one was a 30-min EMS 30 min after a breakfast (EMS trial) and the other was a complete rest after a breakfast (Control trial). In each trial, blood was sampled before and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the meal. RESULTS: Postprandial glucose level was significantly attenuated in EMS trial at 60, 90, and 120 min after a meal (p<0.05). The C-peptide concentration was also significantly lowered in EMS trial (p<0.01). On the other hand, there was no significant increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) concentration in each trial. CONCLUSIONS: The present results provide first evidence indicating that EMS is a new exercise method for treating postprandial hyperglycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes, especially who cannot perform adequate voluntary exercise because of excessive obesity, orthopedic diseases, or severe diabetic complications.
