Background: The association between periodontitis and systemic diseases including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus has repeatedly been recognized. Paraoxonase-1 is involved in the prevention of atherosclerosis and decreased enzyme activity in patients with diabetes has been shown. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between decreased Paraoxonase-1 activity and the association between impaired glucose metabolism or diabetes and periodontitis. Methods: Paraoxonase-1 phenotype distribution and enzyme activities were characterized by measuring the hydrolysis of phenylacetate and paraoxon in serum samples of 87 type 2 diabetes patients and 46 prediabetes patients showing impaired fasting plasma glucose and/or impaired oral glucose tolerance. The control group comprised 64 subjects (normal fasting plasma glucose and normal glucose tolerance). Altogether 154 study subjects were available for complete clinical periodontal examination. Results: No difference in periodontitis prevalence existed between the study groups. However, diabetes patients had an increased risk of suffering from generalized periodontitis (adjusted odds ratio: 4.05; 95 % confidence interval: 1.24 to 13.18, p = 0.02) and their Paraoxonase-1 activity was reduced compared to controls. In contrast, prediabetic subjects did neither show an increased periodontitis risk nor an impaired paraoxonase status. Paraoxonase-1 was not associated directly with periodontitis. Nevertheless, concerning diabetes patients, poor oral hygiene, male gender, and Paraoxonase-1 phenotype were found to be significant predictors for periodontitis extent. Conclusion: Diabetes type 2 but not a prediabetec state increases the risk of generalized periodontitis. Paraoxonase-1 status in type 2 diabetes patients may contribute to this association.
