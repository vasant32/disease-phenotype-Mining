We investigated the relationship between intracoronary stenosis detected by multislice computed tomography and various clinical parameters in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension treated with candesartan (n=42). The results showed that carotid intima-media thickness, but not visceral fat area or adiponectin, correlated significantly with intracoronary stenosis (p<0.05).
