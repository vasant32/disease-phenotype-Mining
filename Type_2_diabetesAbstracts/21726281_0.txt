 OBJECTIVE: During a period of 12 months, we evaluated the longitudinal impact of metabolic control of diabetes on selected bone turnover markers, bone mineral density and serum adiponectin concentrations in post-menopausal women with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Serum total adiponectin, bone alkaline phosphatase, HbA(1c), urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion, bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine and total hip were measured in 57 women aged 50-78 years with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: At baseline, women had normal bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, deoxypyridinoline and bone mineral density, as evaluated by t- and z-scores. After 12 months of treatment, a significant decrease in body weight, waist circumference and HbA(1c) was observed. Bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine and total hip decreased by 0.4, 0.2 and 1.0% (P = 0.018) per year, respectively. Adiponectin was inversely correlated with bone mineral density at three sites (R = -0.28, -0.24 and -0.19, respectively). There was a transient increase (P < 0.05) in serum adiponectin within the first 6 months, followed by a slow decrease toward the baseline value during the next 6 months. An improvement in diabetes control had no impact on bone turnover marker levels, which did not change significantly during the entire study period. CONCLUSIONS: Bone turnover markers, bone mineral density and the rate of bone loss are within normal ranges in post-menopausal women with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. Bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine and total hip is inversely correlated with total adiponectin.
