This study aims to measure iron nutrition parameters and to determine the presence of anemia in obese type 2 diabetic patients and to analyze the mRNA relative abundance of genes related to inflammation, immune system, iron metabolism, and mitochondrial activity. Obese type 2 diabetic (OBDM, n = 30) and healthy subjects (Cn, n = 30) were studied. Biochemical, anthropometric, and iron nutrition parameters were determined. Peripheral mononuclear cells from type 2 diabetic and control group were challenged with high concentrations of iron (Fe) and glucose and total mRNA was isolated. The frequency of anemia among diabetic patients was 4/30. OBDM patients with or without anemia had higher levels of ferritin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein than the Cn group. mRNA relative abundance of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells was elevated in OBDM with anemia, and mRNA expression of interleukin-6 and toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 was increased in OBDM group in basal high Fe and high glucose concentrations. The expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and TLR-4 was increased in OBDM with anemia in all experimental conditions. Hepcidin mRNA expression was increased in OBDM with anemia even in basal Fe concentration, and mitofusin 2 was decreased in all experimental conditions. This study shows that obese type 2 diabetic patients have iron distribution disorders associated to their proinflammatory state, and anemic subjects have a marked elevation of hepcidin mRNA expression.
