Azilsartan is a new ARB with the specific and potent angiotensin II receptor binding-inhibitory effect and more continuous angiotensin II antagonistic and antihypertensive actions in pre-clinical studies compared with other ARBs. The controlled clinical study in Japanese hypertensive patients indicates that once-daily azilsartan dose provides more potent 24-hour sustained antihypertensive effect than that of candesartan but with equivalent safety. Azilsartan was confirmed to improve more potently the insulin-resistance in SHR and type 2 diabetic mice and suppress more prominently the urinary albumin excretion in type 2 diabetic fatty rats than other ARBs. Thus, azilsartan is a unique antihypertensive agent with the profile of more beneficial pharmacological activity, and could provide higher rates of hypertension control over 24-hour following once daily administration.
