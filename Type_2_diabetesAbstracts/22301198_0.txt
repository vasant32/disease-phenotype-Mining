 UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is associated with obesity. The visceral adiposity and subcutaneous adiposity may be associated with the differential metabolic risk, and the distribution of abdominal adipose tissue was significantly altered in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) compared to healthy people. Our study was performed to determine to the association between the regional abdominal adipose tissue distribution and serum uric acid levels in people with type 2 DM. METHODS: A total of 699 people with type 2 DM and who had undergone abdominal computed tomography assessment of the visceral fat area and subcutaneous fat area were included. The serum uric acid levels were measured by the uricase method. Hyperuricemia was defined by cut-off value of > 7 mg/dl for men and > 6 mg/dl for women. RESULTS: The visceral fat area was positively associated with the serum uric acid levels after adjustment for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, serum albumin, serum high-density lipoprotein, serum triglyceride and hemoglobin A1c (β-coefficient = 0.117, p < 0.001). The logistic regression analysis showed that the visceral fat area was the significant independent predictor of hyperuricemia (OR 2.33, 95% CI, 1.21-4.50, p = 0.012). But there was no significant association between the subcutaneous fat area and the serum uric acid levels (β-coefficient = 0.061, p = 0.255). CONCLUSIONS: our data shows that the visceral fat area was positively associated with the serum uric acid levels, but the subcutaneous fat area was not in people with type 2 DM.
