 OBJECTIVE: The rate of reduction of nocturnal blood pressure (NBP) is lesser than normal in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM). Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHC) disrupts vascular structure and function, no matter the underlying causes. The risk of development of vascular disease is greater in diabetic patients with hyperhomocysteinemia than in patients with normal homocystein levels. The aim of the study was to investigate whether there are differences of homocystein levels in dipper and non-dippers patients with type 2 DM. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We compared 50 patien-ts (33 females, 17 males) with type 2 DM and 35 healthy individuals (18 females, 17 males ) in a control group. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed and homocysteine levels were measured in all patients. RESULTS: We found that the percentage of non-dipper pattern was 72% in patients with type 2 DM and 57% in control group. In diabetic and control individuals, homocystein levels were higher in non-dipper (respectively 13.4 ± 8.1 µmol/L and 11.8 ± 5 µmol/L) than in dipper subjects (respectively, 11.8 ± 5.8 µmol/L and 10.1 ± 4.2 µmol/L), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (respectively, p = 0.545, p = 0.294). CONCLUSION: In both groups, homocystein levels were higher in non-dipper than in dipper participants, but there was no significant difference between the groups. High homocystein levels and the non-dipper pattern increases cardiovascular risk. Therefore, the relationship between nocturnal blood pressure changes and homocystein levels should be investigated in a larger study.
