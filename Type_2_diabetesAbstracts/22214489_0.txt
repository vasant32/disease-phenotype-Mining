INTRODUCTION: Although traditionally used as a final treatment option, early use of insulin is a therapeutic option after metformin failure in type 2 diabetes. Injection of native insulin lacks the rapid onset of action after food ingestion and the chronic maintenance of a steady-state low-level basal insulin in fasting periods. These limitations have fuelled the development of insulin analogues, which mainly fall into two different categories: short-acting and long-acting analogues. AREAS COVERED: We review the recent literature investigating the efficacy and safety of insulin analogues in human diabetes, with emphasis on type 2 diabetes, as about 30% of these patients are being treated with insulin. We also examine novel developments in this area, including the new long-acting basal analogues whose longer duration of action might reduce dosing frequency to three times a week. EXPERT OPINION: Insulin analogues show some advantage compared with native insulin. However, improvements in reducing their pharmacological variability would be expected to lower the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, as well as to simplify and perhaps also encourage optimal insulin titration in real-life clinical practice. Extending the duration of insulin effect would also allow for greater flexibility and potentially reduce the frequency of blood glucose monitoring.
