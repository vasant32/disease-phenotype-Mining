The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide. The existing therapeutic classes of antidiabetic drugs are not adequately effective in maintaining long-term glycemic control in most patients, even when used in combination. One emerging novel therapeutic class of antidiabetic drugs is sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. SGLT2 accounts for 90% of the glucose reabsorption in the kidney. The SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary excretion of glucose and lower plasma glucose levels in an insulin-independent manner. Dapagliflozin, the most prominent molecule in this class, is currently in a phase III clinical trial. Other members of this class (eg, sergliflozin, remogliflozin) are also in different phases of clinical trials. This class of novel agents can effectively control blood sugar level without producing weight gain or hypoglycemia. Results of ongoing phase III clinical trials are crucial to determine whether the risk-benefit ratio will allow approval of this new class of drugs for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
