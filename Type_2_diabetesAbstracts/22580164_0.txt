Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multisystem disease that is characterized by hyperglycemia and is associated with the dysfunction and failure of various organs. The control of postprandial hyperglycemia is important in the prevention and intervention of type 2 diabetes. Fucoidan has several biological activities in vitro and in vivo. However, the effect of fucoidan on hyperglycemia in non-diabetic and diabetic mice has not been investigated. This study was undertaken to study the effects of different molecular weight forms (5 kilodalton (k), 5-30 k and crude) of fucoidan on oral glucose tolerance tests in non-diabetic mice and on food intake, weight gain, fasting blood glucose and blood biochemistry of db/db mice. Treatment with 200 mg/mL 5 k, 5-30 k and crude fucoidan substantially prevented hyperglycemia according to oral glucose tolerance tests in non-diabetic mice. In addition, fucoidan fractions significantly reduced blood glucose levels in diabetic mice.
