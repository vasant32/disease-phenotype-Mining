 AIMS: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major public health problem around the world. The C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have been reported to be associated with T2DM and its complications. This study aimed to investigate this association in the Moroccan population. METHODS: A case-control study was performed among 282 Moroccan diabetic patients and 232 healthy controls. The MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction, followed by enzymatic digestion with HinfI and MboII enzymes, respectively. RESULTS: There was a significant association between C677T polymorphism and T2DM in both additive and dominant models. In addition, the 677T allele frequency differed significantly between the diabetic and control groups (26.06% vs. 33.20%, respectively). However, no significant association was found between A1298C polymorphism and T2DM. The frequencies of combined genotypes 677CC/1298AA and 677CT/1298AC differed significantly between the diabetic and control groups (32.62% vs. 20.61% and 9.57% vs. 17.55%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results show an evident association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and T2DM in Moroccan patients but no significant association with the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism.
