Cytokines are small cell signaling protein molecules which encompass a large and diverse family. They consist of immunomodulating agents such as interleukins and inteferons. Virtually all nucleated cells, especially endo/epithelial cells and macrophages are potent producers of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α. IL-1 family is a group of cytokines which play a central role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been recognized as an immune mediated disease leading to impaired insulin signaling and selective destruction of insulin producing β-cells in which cytokines play an important role. Disturbance of anti-inflammatory response could be a critical component of the chronic inflammation resulting in T2D. IL-1 family of cytokines has important roles in endocrinology and in the regulation of responses associated with inflammatory stress. The IL-1 family consists of two pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1α and IL-1β, and a naturally occurring anti-inflammatory agent, the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra or IL-1RN). This review is an insight into the different types of cytokines belonging to IL-1 family, their modes of action and association with Type 2 diabetes.
