This commentary discusses whether screening for type 2 diabetes or earlier normalisation of blood glucose levels or initiation of non-antihyperglycaemic agents or any other diabetes-specific treatment can help reduce the excess associated risks for macrovascular morbidity and mortality. The available data indicate that screening with the sole aim of decreasing the lead time between diagnosis and treatment is very unlikely to reduce these risks. In contrast to macrovascular complications, some microvascular events such as background retinopathy could theoretically be prevented by earlier diagnosis and better glycaemic control, particularly in relatively young type 2 diabetic patients. This, however, remains to be shown in controlled prospective intervention trials.
