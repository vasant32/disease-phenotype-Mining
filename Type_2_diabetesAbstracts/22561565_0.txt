 OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of systematic self-management education on blood sugar level of patients in the community with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 248 patients with type 2 diabetes from 10 communities of Changsha were randomized into intervention or control groups in February 2009. The intervention group received systematic self-management education, while the other received routine community education. Before and after intervention, fasting plasma glucose, 2 h postprandial plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured, and evaluated between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose, 2 h postprandial plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels of patients with diabetes from the two groups were generally comparable at baseline (P>0.05). After the intervention, these three indicators were all statistically significant between the 2 groups (P<0.01, P<0.05, P<0.01, respectively). After intervention, blood sugar levels in the intervention group were obviously improved (P<0.01), while in the control group, fasting plasma glucose was not statistically improved (P>0.05), 2 h plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were improved (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Systematic self-management education effectively encourages patients with type 2 diabetes to control their blood sugar levels, and deserves further promotion.
