The present study was designed to elucidate the character and severity of electrophysiological disturbances in the patients presenting with arterial hypertension (AH) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). It included 55 patients with AH (mean age 50.4 +- 4.7 years) allocated to two groups. Group 1 was comprised of 25 patients with arterial hypertension and concomitant type 2 diabetes mellitus. Group 2 (n = 30) consisted of the patients with AH in the absence of diabetes. All the patients were examined using 12-lead ECG and high-resolution ECG (HR-ECG) supplemented by the analysis of late ventricular potentials (LVP) and cardiac rhythm variability (CRV). The study has demonstrated that diabetes mellitus in the patients suffering AH aggravates the disturbances in electrophysiological properties of myocardium compared with the patients having no metabolic disorders. These disturbances include changes of both repolarization and depolarization of myocardium. The patients with AH and concomitant diabetes mellitus had much higher values of dispersion and duration of QT-interval. Analysis of the results of HR-ECG in the two groups has revealed a significantly higher occurrence of late ventricular potentials in the patients with AH and concomitant type 2 DM (52% and 27% respectively; x2 = 4.43, p = 0.03). Analysis of rhythmograms showed progressive deterioration of temporal and spectral characteristics of CRV in the group of patients with AH and concomitant type 2 DM. Moreover; these patients were characterized by the reduction of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on myocardium.
