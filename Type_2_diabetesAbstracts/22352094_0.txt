 OBJECTIVES: To assess empowerment score in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: A descriptive - correlation study was performed for a period of four months in 2011. Study population was type 2 diabetic patients referred to Omolbanin, Diabetic Center in Isfahan, cultural capital of Iran. Hundred and sixty diabetic patients met the inclusion criteria and were all included in the study. Patient's empowerment was measured by DES (Diabetes Empowerment Scale) self-report scale with subscales reflecting three areas including Managing the psychosocial aspect of diabetes (9 items), Assessing dissatisfaction and readiness to change (9 items) and Setting and achieving diabetes goal (10 items). Collected data was analyzed by using SPSS software version 11.5. RESULTS: Participants were between the ages of 38 and 78 with a mean of 48.67 +/- 7.99 years. There were 49.4% males, 87.5% were married, and 44.9% had education of diploma and higher. Mean duration of diabetes was 5.62 +/- 3.81 years. In all 46.9% participants had borderline metabolic control according to World Health Organization criteria. Using Diabetes Empowerment Scale, three conceptual domains of 'Managing the psychosocial aspect of diabetes', 'Assessing dissatisfaction and readiness to change' and 'Setting and achieving diabetes goal' were measured and scored for each patient. The average score of each domain was 27.15 +/- 8.20), (29.03 +/- 10.40), (31.95 +/- 11.70) respectively. 'Setting and achieving diabetes goal' was considered as the most important domain in measuring diabetes self-management. Diabetes empowerment level showed a significant relationship between variables such as educational level (p<0.001), gender (0.007), age (p<0.001), and duration of diabetes (p<0.001). Pearson correlation coefficient also revealed that empowerment of type 2 diabetic patients has a reverse relationship with HbA1c (r = - 0.75, p 0.001). Furthermore, ordinal regression test revealed that having diploma and higher education (p=0.005), and optimal and borderline HbA1c (p<0.001) were effective factors in empowering diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: Empowerment is psychosocial self-efficacy. Healthcare professionals and researches have introduced 'self-empowerment' as a key element in managing chronic diseases. When it comes to diabetes, empowerment implies an approach that attempts to enhance the ability of patients to actively understand and influence their own lives and health status. It seems that patients with diabetes can be empowered to manage their chronic disease if they are actively informed and educated.
