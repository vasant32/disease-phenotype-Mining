BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a multifactorial and polygenic disease, which is considered as a major life threatening problem all over the world. There has been a worldwide effort in the identification of susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications. At present, adequate data is not available dealing with MTHFR (rs1801133) and PPARγ2 (rs1801282) gene polymorphisms and its association with type 2 diabetes mellitus cases among north Indian populations. Thus, we conceived the need for further studies to investigate MTHFR and PPARγ2 genes polymorphisms and its susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in north Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, total 175 subjects including 87 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases and 88 controls were enrolled. MTHFR and PPARγ2 gene polymorphism in the cases and controls were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The MTHFR gene CC, CT, TT genotype frequencies were obtained 40%, 43%, 17% in type 2 diabetes mellitus cases and 56%, 29%, 15% in healthy controls respectively. The OR for CC was 0.54 (95%CI 0.29-0.98, P=0.041, χ2=4.18, power=0.98), for CT 1.76 (95%CI 0.94-3.30, P=0.07, χ2=3.2, power=0.96), for TT 1.2 (95%CI 0.53-2.70, P=0.66, χ2=0.198, power=0.76). The PPARγ2 gene GG CG, CC genotype frequencies were obtained 28%, 41%, 31% in cases and 40%, 39%, 21% in healthy controls respectively. OR for GG was 0.58 (95%CI 0.30-1.09, P=0.08, χ2=2.9, power=0.96), for CG 1.12 (95%CI 0.61-2.05, P=0.71, χ2=0.137, power=0.778), for CC 1.63 (95%CI 0.82-3.23, P=0.156, χ2=2.01, power=0.92). CONCLUSION: It might be recommended that MTHFR CC genotype seems to be a good marker for the early identification of population at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. While we have detected significant difference in allelic frequencies of PPARγ2 C (Proline) and G (Alanine), but at genotypic level significant difference was not detected in this case-control study. Further study with larger groups may be required to validate the study.
