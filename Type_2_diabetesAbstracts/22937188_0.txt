 BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentration has been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic individuals independent of conventional risk factors. Available study in Nigerian-Africans is scare. METHODS: Seventy (30 males) and (40 females) type 2 diabetes mellitus, with age mean of 54 Â± 11.52 years were selected for this study and thirty apparently healthy volunteers were included as controls. The biochemical parameters and anthropometric indices were determined using standard procedures. RESULTS: Significant increases were obtained in body weight, body mass index (p<0.001) and waist circumference (p<0.012) when compared with the corresponding control values respectively. The fasting plasma glucose (p<0.01), tHcy (p<0.02), and triglyceride (p<0.03) were significantly higher in the diabetes group when compared with the corresponding control values. The plasma folic acid and vitamin B(12) (p<0.05) were significantly reduced compared to the control values. The tHcy (p<0.01) was significantly higher in the males when compared with the corresponding female value. Significant decrease was obtained in the plasma triglyceride (p<0.003) in the male patients when compared with the female patients. CONCLUSION: Our result showed increased plasma tHcy, triglyceride and waist circumference as well as decreased folic acid and vitamin B(12) in type 2 diabetes mellitus. These alterations are risk factors for premature CVD events.
