Spontaneously Diabetic Torii (SDT) rat is a hereditary model of diabetes. Although the SDT rat shows severe diabetic complications, the onset of hyperglycemia is late. SDT fatty rat, established by introducing the fa allele of the Zucker fatty rat to SDT rat, develops diabetes much faster than SDT rat. In the present study, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was evaluated to show the further usefulness of this animal model. Motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV) was delayed and the number of sural nerve fibers was decreased in SDT fatty rat. Treatment of pioglitazone lowered blood glucose level and prevented delay of MNCV in SDT fatty rats. SDT fatty rat is a useful animal model for studies of DPN in type 2 diabetes.
