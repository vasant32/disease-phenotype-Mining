Obesity is a major risk factor for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). However, many Japanese subjects with diabetes are less obese despite compared with Caucasian. We evaluated the relationship between SDB and clinical characteristics other than obesity, especially in relation to cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in Japanese subjects with diabetes. The study included a total of 261 consecutive Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes, including nonobese subjects defined as BMI <25 kg/m(2) for Japanese. SDB was screened by 4% oxygen desaturation index (ODI) level of 5 or more events per hour, which was measured by nocturnal pulse oximetry. CAN was examined with the variation of R-R intervals (CVRR). The SDB were found in 24.5% of total subjects and 16.3% of nonobese subjects with type 2 diabetes, respectively. The nonobese type 2 diabetes subjects with SDB had significantly lower coefficient of CVRR than those without SDB. Multiple regression analysis revealed that BMI and heart rate were significant independent factors for SDB in total subjects with type 2 diabetes, but CVRR was the only significant independent factor for SDB in nonobese subjects with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that the presence of SDB should be kept in mind in type 2 diabetic patients with abnormality in CVRR variation in electrocardiogram even though they are not obese.
