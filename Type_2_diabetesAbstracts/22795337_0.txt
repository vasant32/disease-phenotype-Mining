BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Increased evidence suggests that apart from patients with increased albumin excretion and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR); there are also patients with type 2 diabetes with decreased GFR but without albuminuria. The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms regarding these clinical conditions are not known. We suggest that different blood pressure (BP) levels may be one the factors for these different clinical conditions. However, before labeling BP as a causative factor; one must show whether BP levels are different in these patients. Thus the current study was performed to analyze the relationship between creatinine clearance, microalbuminuria and circadian blood pressure levels in newly diagnosed essential hypertensive and type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Medical history, physical examination, laboratory analysis and ambulatory blood pressure measurements (ABPMs) were analyzed. 24-h urine specimens were collected to measure creatinine clearance and albumin excretion RESULTS: In total 216 patients were included which were divided into 4 groups: group 1 composed of 90 patients with normal GFR and without microalbuminuria (MA), group 2 composed of 50 patients with normal GFR and with MA, group 3 composed of 36 patients with decreased GFR and without MA and group 4 composed of 40 patients with both decreased GFR and MA. The ratio of dippers vs. non dippers was not different between group 1, group 2 and group 3 patients. However ratio of dippers was higher in group 1 when compared to group 4 (P: 0.003) and group 4 patients have an odds of 7.678 (CI: 1.657-35.576, P: 0.009) for non-dapping status when compared to patients in group 1. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, ABPM measurements were highest in patients with both decreased GFR and MA, whereas they are lowest in patients with normal GFR and normal UAE.
