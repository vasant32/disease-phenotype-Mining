G-protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40), known as free fatty acid receptor 1, is mainly expressed in pancreatic β-cells and activated by medium- and long-chain fatty acids. Increasing evidence indicates that the activation of GPR40 in cells causes insulin secretion, and GPR40 has become an attractive therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes. Recently, certain novel GPR40 agonists have been identified that regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, leading to the development of new drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this review, we focus on progress in the physiological role of GPR40 and potential drugs targeting GPR40 over the past decade.
