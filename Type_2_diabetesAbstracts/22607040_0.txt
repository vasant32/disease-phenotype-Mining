Background:  Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that decreases the quality of life of T2DM patients. Very few studies have found an association between the development and progression of DPN in T2DM and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms. Methods:  Using gene-specific primers in a polymerase chain reaction, the presence of ACE I/D polymorphisms was screened for in 276 T2DM patients with DPN, 496 T2DM patients without DPN, and 331 control (non-diabetic) subjects. Results:  The distribution of the I/D genotypes was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The II genotype was significantly more prevalent in T2DM patients without DPN than the DD genotype (P < 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of the II and DD genotypes in T2DM patients with DPN (P = 0.78). Conclusion:  The II genotype of the ACE gene has a protective effect against the development of DPN in T2DM patients. This suggests a role for the renin-angiotensin system in modulating neuropathy in T2DM.
