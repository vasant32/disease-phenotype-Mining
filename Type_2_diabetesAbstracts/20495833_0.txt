Some inflammation factors have been shown to accelerate type 2 diabetes macrovascular complication (T2DMC). The study investigates the variation of TNF-α and IL-6 levels during the progression of T2DMC to explore their predictive value in the incidence of T2DMC. All participants were divided into two groups, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-diabetes (ND) group. TNF-α and IL-6 were analyzed with enzyme immunoassay. All participants were followed up by carotid Doppler, Doppler of lower extremities, head CT and 64-row multislice spiral CTA. The incidence of macrovascular atherosclerosis in T2DM was significantly higher than that in ND group (P < 0.05). The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in both groups with atherosclerosis increased annually. In patients who had atherosclerosis with diabetes, measured levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly higher than those in patients with atherosclerosis without diabetes (P < 0.05). The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in T2DMC and ND group with atherosclerosis was significantly higher than that in two groups without atherosclerosis (P < 0.05). Patients with T2DM were divided into four groups according to their HbA1C level. There was a strong positive correlation between the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and HbA1C (P > 0.05). The TNF-α and IL-6 levels can be used as predictors for atherosclerosis development. Compared with non-diabetic atherosclerosis, TNF-α and IL-6 have stronger predictive value in diabetic atherosclerosis development. One reason for hyperglycemia increasing atherosclerosis is to activate inflammatory cells and relives of inflammatory factors. Hyperglycemia can trigger inflammation, which is a quality-effect relationship reaction.
