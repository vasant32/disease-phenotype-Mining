 AIMS: Serum androgen concentration is reported to be low in patients with Type 2 diabetes. There have been no studies comparing andropausal symptoms such as sleep disturbance, depression, erectile dysfunction and lower urinary tract symptoms simultaneously between men with Type 2 diabetes and subjects without diabetes. METHODS: We compared andropausal symptom scores such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, the International Index of Erectile Function and the International Prostate Symptom Score in 296 men with Type 2 diabetes and in 267 subjects without diabetes. Furthermore, we evaluated relationships of andropausal symptom scores to various anthropometric factors and compared andropausal symptom scores according to diabetic complications in men with Type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Andropausal symptom scores such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Self-Rating Depression Scale, the International Index of Erectile Function and the International Prostate Symptom Score were 4.2 ± 2.6 vs. 5.0 ± 3.3, P<0.01 by unpaired Student's t-test, 34.8 ± 8.2 vs. 38.4 ± 9.3, P<0.0001, 11.5 ± 6.4 vs. 9.9 ± 6.9, P<0.01 and 7.3 ± 6.7 vs. 9.0 ± 7.1, P<0.01 in subjects without diabetes and in patients with diabetes, respectively. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was higher in patients with neuropathy than without. The Self-Rating Depression Scale was higher in patients with advanced retinopathy. The International Index of Erectile Function was lower in patients with advanced retinopathy and nephropathy. The International Index of Erectile Function was lower and the International Prostate Symptom Score was higher in patients with cardiovascular disease than without. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrated that men with Type 2 diabetes have higher prevalence of andropausal symptoms, especially those with diabetic complications.
