 OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence and etiology of kidney disease and the related risk factors in type 2 diabetic patients in rural Shanghai. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in type 2 diabetic patients was conducted in a community of Shanghai. Questionnaire, clinical examination and laboratory tests were completed to collect the information about sociodemographic and healthcare characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 1421 eligible patients with complete information were screened from 1487 type 2 diabetic patients between November 2008 and March 2009. Of them, 40.75% were men, 59.25% were women, aged 37 - 86 (61.33 ± 9.65) years old, with diabetic duration of 0.25 - 43.92 (7.85 ± 6.34) years. Among them, 43.42% had diabetic retinopathy, 21.18% had neuropathy; 69.95% met the screening definition for hypertension, 76.07% for hyperlipidemia, 15.55% for hyperuricemia and 23.65% for cardiovascular disease. The control rates of fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure and serum cholesterol were 57.71%, 33.99%, 14.22% and 2.46%, respectively. The prevalence of kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy and non-diabetic renal disease was 41.31%, 18.51% and 13.44%, respectively; and 9.36% were diagnosed as renal insufficiency of unknown reasons. Age, diabetic duration, hyperuricemia, diabetic retinopathy and poor control of blood pressure were independently associated with kidney disease; age and poor control of blood pressure were independently associated with diabetic nephropathy; age and hyperuricemia were independent risk factors of renal insufficiency in patients with diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the diabetic duration of these subjects is relatively short, the prevalence of complications including diabetic nephropathy is high. The high prevalence of non-diabetic renal disease shows the importance of further screening and diagnoses for prevention. Strict control of blood glucose, blood pressure, serum cholesterol and serum uric acid are key points of cutting down the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease.
