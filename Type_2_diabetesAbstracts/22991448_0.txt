OBJECTIVETo know whether age has an independent effect on the dawn phenomenon in noninsulin-using type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSEighty-one individuals with type 2 diabetes were matched for HbA(1c) and divided by age into three subgroups of 27 individuals (1: ≥70 years; 2: 60-69 years; and 3: ≤59 years). All underwent ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring for quantifying the dawn phenomenon (i.e., the absolute [∂G, mg/dL] or relative [∂G%] increments from nocturnal nadirs to prebreakfast time points).RESULTSHbA(1c) levels and 24-h glycemic profiles were similar across the three groups. Glucose increments (mean ± SEM) were identical in the three groups: ∂G (mg/dL), 22.0 ± 4.7 (1), 21.3 ± 3.6 (2), 18.0 ± 3.6 (3); and δG (%), 19.9 ± 4.9 (1), 21.6 ± 4.4 (2), and 17.6 ± 4.2 (3). Using the most common definition (∂G >10 mg/dL), the prevalence of the dawn phenomenon was 52, 70, and 59% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.CONCLUSIONSThe dawn phenomenon is present in the elderly.
