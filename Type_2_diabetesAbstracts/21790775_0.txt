 AIMS: In cohort studies, Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been associated with decreased forced 1 s expiratory volume and forced vital capacity. We examined if forced vital capacity, forced 1 s expiratory volume and diffusion lung capacity correlate with diabetes mellitus across different races in a clinical setting. METHODS: We examined the medical records of 19,882 adults 18-97 years of age in our centre from 1 January 2000 to 1 May 2009. After excluding patients with diseases causing abnormal lung function, 4164 subjects were available for analysis. We used multiple linear regressions to examine cross-sectional differences in forced vital capacity, forced 1 s expiratory volume and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity between patients with and without diabetes mellitus, after adjustment for age, sex, race, height, smoking, BMI and heart failure. RESULTS: Patients with diabetes (n = 560) were older (62 ± 12 vs. 55 ± 16 years), more likely to be men (56 vs. 43%), overweight (BMI 31.7 ± 8.5 vs. 27.3 ± 6.7 kg/m2 ), have heart failure (33 vs. 14%) and less likely to be Caucasians (65 vs. 76%) and never smokers (66 vs. 72%) compared with patients without diabetes (n = 3604). The mean unadjusted values in patients with diabetes vs. those without were: forced vital capacity 2.78 ± 0.91 vs. 3.19 ± 1.03 l; forced 1 s expiratory volume 2.17 ± 0.74 vs. 2.49 ± 0.0.83; and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity 16.67 ± 5.53 vs. 19.18 ± 6.72 ml(-1) min(-1) mmHg, all P < 0.0001. These differences remained significant after adjustment for covariates. After race stratification, only Caucasians with diabetes had a significant decrease in all lung function measures. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes have decreased lung function compared with those without diabetes. Caucasians with diabetes have more global lung function impairment compared with African-Americans and Hispanics.
