In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the efficacy and safety of transglucosidase (TGD) were compared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). At 12 weeks, TGD 300 mg/day and TGD 900 mg/day significantly reduced HbA1c (0.18 and 0.21%) and insulin concentration (19.4 and 25.0 pmol/l), respectively, vs. placebo. TGD 300 mg/day and TGD 900 mg/day also significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.22 and 0.17 mmol/l, respectively). TGD 900 mg/day significantly reduced triglyceride by 0.24 mmol/l and diastolic blood pressure by 8 mmHg. Placebo was associated with a significant increase from baseline in body mass index, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (0.17 kg/m(2) , 3 and 2 U/l, respectively), whereas TGD was not. TGD 300 mg/day significantly increased high-molecular-weight adiponectin by 0.6 Âµg/ml. Adverse events did not differ significantly between the groups. TGD resulted in lowering of HbA1c and blood insulin level and improvements in metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors in T2DM.
