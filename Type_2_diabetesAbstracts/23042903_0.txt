Type 2 diabetes adversely affects properties of native connective tissue. The underlying mechanisms, however, by which diabetes alters connective tissue metabolism, especially tendon are poorly defined. The aim was to study the effect of type 2 diabetes on mechanical, histological and molecular properties of the intact and healing Achilles tendon. Right Achilles tendon was transected in 11 male diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) and 10 age- and sex-matched Wistar control rats, while left Achilles tendon was left intact. At 2 weeks post-injury, intact and injured tendons were assessed by biomechanical testing and histology. Collagen I and III, biglycan, versican, MMP-13 and MMP-3 gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and protein distribution was studied by immunohistochemistry. Intact tendons exhibited only small differences between the groups. In injured tendons, however, a significantly smaller transverse area and lower stiffness was found in diabetic GK compared to Wistar control rats. This correlated with impaired structural organization of collagen fibres and a reduced expression of collagen I and III in the injured tendons of diabetic GK compared to Wistar control. Moreover, MMP-3 gene expression was down-regulated in the injured diabetic GK tendons compared to injured Wister controls. Our results indicate that in rat model of diabetes tendon healing is impaired mainly due to altered expression of collagen and MMPs reflecting decreased degradation of matrix proteins and impaired tissue remodeling. Our data suggest that therapeutic modulation of collagens or MMPs might be targets for new regenerative approaches in operated, injured or possibly degenerative tendon diseases in diabetes.
