We evaluated the serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and their association with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in 199 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome ([MetS], group A) in comparison with 109 healthy controls (group B). In group A, MCP-1 levels were significantly (P < .001) higher than group B and exhibited a positive correlation with HbA(1c) (P < .001) and a negative correlation with ankle-brachial index (P < .001). In the same group, patients with PAD had significantly higher MCP-1 levels compared with those without PAD (P < .001). In conclusion, T2DM patients with MetS exhibit higher serum MCP-1 levels. The latter is associated with worse glycemic control and PAD. These results suggest a potential contributory role for MCP-1 in the pathogenesis of PAD in the presence of hyperglycemia and MetS in T2DM.
