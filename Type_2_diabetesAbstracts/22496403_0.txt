Background: Diabetic patients often exhibit severe, asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). The relationship between osteoprotegerin (OPG), inflammatory markers and silent myocardial ischemia remains to be elucidated.Methods: We recruited 45 type 2 diabetic patients and 33 healthy controls and assessed them for silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) by myocardial perfusion imaging. Patient blood was tested for OPG, IL-6 and leptin concentrations.Results: OPG, leptin and IL-6 levels were found significantly elevated in diabetic patients (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.05). Based on our classification of presence/absence of SMI in our diabetic group, we found that there was a significant association between SMI and the biomarkers IL-6 (p < 0.001), leptin (p < 0.001) and OPG (p < 0.05). In multivariate regression analyses, OPG was found to be significantly related to diabetes mellitus and to SMI. Age, sex and smoking increased the association between OPG and SMI.Conclusion: High OPG, leptin and IL-6 levels are associated with the presence and severity of SMI in type 2 diabetic patients.
