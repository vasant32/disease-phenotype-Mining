 BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and depressive symptoms are statistically associated. The question is if one of the two diseases is causal for the other. METHODS: Systematic review using Medline and searching for prospective controlled population based observational studies and meta-analysis in English or German language. RESULTS: Patients with type 2 diabetes have a higher incidence of depressive symptoms - compared to patients having no diabetes. And patients with depressive symptoms have a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes; however the findings for the first relation are only weak. DISCUSSION: Knowing about this - even causal - co-morbidity is important in care, including a routine diagnostic approach to find out if the other disease is also present.
