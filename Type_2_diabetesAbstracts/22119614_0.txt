We conducted a six-month randomized-controlled-trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a colour-coded HbA1c-graphical record in improving HbA1c level among type 2 diabetes patients. There was an improvement in the mean HbA1c knowledge score but the usage of the colour-coded HbA1c-graphical record did not produce reduction in the HbA1c level.
