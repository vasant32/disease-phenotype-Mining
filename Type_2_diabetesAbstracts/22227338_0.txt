Recently, there has been a growing interest in alternative therapies of marine algae for diabetes. Therefore, the anti-diabetic effects of brown alga, Ecklonia cava was investigated in type 2 diabetic animal. Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db (db/db) mice were divided into control, dieckol rich extract of E. cava (AG-dieckol), or rosiglitazone (RG) groups. The blood glucose, blood glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and plasma insulin levels were significantly lower in the AG-dieckol and RG groups than in the control db/db mice group, while glucose tolerance was significantly improved in the AG-dieckol group. AG-dieckol markedly lowered plasma and hepatic lipids concentration compared to the control db/db mice group. The antioxidant enzyme activities were significantly higher in the AG-dieckol group than in the control db/db mice group, yet its TBARS level was markedly lower compared to the RG group. With regard to hepatic glucose regulating enzyme activities, glucokinase activity was enhanced in the AG-dieckol group mice, while glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities in the AG-dieckol group mice were significantly lowered than those in the control db/db mice group. These results suggest that AG-dieckol exert an anti-diabetic effect in type 2 diabetic mice by improving the glucose and lipid metabolism and antioxidant enzymes.
