The concordance of continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) and finger-stick blood glucose (FSBG) was assessed in patients with type 2 diabetes during daily activities and two different exercise sessions. Agreement between FSBG and CGMS becomes weaker during exercise, but more than 90% of the CGMS readings are within acceptable range.
