Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with cognitive dysfunction and hippocampus volume. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the level of the adipocytokine adiponectin correlates with hippocampus volume and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 DM. A total of 45 patients with type 2 DM were divided into two groups: a low adiponectin group and a normal adiponectin group. Hippocampus volume was measured by computer-assisted analysis using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) voxel-based specific regional analysis system developed for the study of Alzheimer's disease as the end point for assessment of hippocampus volume. Mean hippocampus volume was lower in the low adiponectin group than in the normal adiponectin group (P<.0001). Fasting serum concentrations of glucose (P<.05) and insulin (P<.0001), and homeostasis model assessment index (P<.0001), were all higher in the low adiponectin group than in the normal adiponectin group. Multiple regression analysis showed that hippocampus volume independently predicted serum adiponectin level. These results suggest that circulating levels of adiponectin are related to hippocampus volume in patients with type 2 DM.
