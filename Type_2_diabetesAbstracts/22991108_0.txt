The purpose of this study is to present an understanding of the experience of Brazilian homemakers with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). A descriptive exploratory design was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 Brazilian homemakers concerning their experience. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and the resulting text was analyzed using the sequential step method. Data converged to one dominant category, "constructing one's identity in the family context", which is comprised of three categories: gender differences; day-to-day concerns; and incongruity between knowledge and behavior related to DM2. These findings suggest that participants construct their identities within the family context and that their experience of living with DM2 is integral to their self-identification as wives and mothers. This, in turn, has implications for the design and implementation of programs to assist women in managing DM2 effectively.
