In view of the high incidence of macrovascular diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria, the study evaluates the association of microalbuminuria with fasting plasma Apo B48 levels, a marker of the residual presence of intestinally derived TRLs lipoproteins, thought to be highly atherogenic. We studied 50 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 35-75 years. Exclusion criteria were overt macrovascular disease, overt nephropathy (Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <45 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), or use of hypolipidemic agents. Anthropometry, fasting plasma lipids, plasma creatinine, and HbA1c were measured. Urinary albumin excretion was measured on a morning urine sample with the ELISA and expressed as albumin/creatinine ratio. GFR was estimated using the MDRD formula. The plasma fasting Apo B48 was measured by ELISA. Age, gender distribution, fasting plasma lipids, HbA1c, smoking status, plasma creatinine, estimate GFR, and the proportion of patients treated with insulin or antihypertensive drugs were similar for patients with or without microalbuminuria. People with microalbuminuria had longer diabetes duration (borderline significance) and significantly higher Apo B48 (1.765 ± 1.379 μg/ml vs. 1.022 ± 0.692 μg/ml, p = 0.01) than those without microalbuminuria. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that fasting Apo B48 levels were significantly associated with microalbuminuria independent of major confounders measured in the study. In patients with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria is associated with elevated Apo B48 levels, independent of major confounders; this may partly explain the excess cardiovascular risk of these patients.
