 OBJECTIVE: This study determined if short-term (professional) blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves hemoglobin A1c levels in a mixed group of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the clinical setting of an office practice. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 102 consecutive patients with diabetes over the course of 10 months in a subspecialty practice undergoing 3-day blinded CGM using the iPRO(™) device (Medtronic, Northridge, CA). Hemoglobin A1c levels were measured prior to and up to 7 months after the CGM procedure. RESULTS: Before blinded CGM the average hemoglobin A1c level was 7.7±1.0%, and after it was 7.8±1.1%. These values are not statistically different. A subgroup analysis of subjects using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion treatment also failed to show a significant hemoglobin A1c difference pre- and post-CGM. CONCLUSIONS: Using the iPro device for short-term (professional) blinded CGM in an office setting to improve hemoglobin A1c levels may not be a feasible goal for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The expectations of benefit, choice of patient, and choice of technology for short-term CGM are factors requiring careful consideration before testing takes place.
