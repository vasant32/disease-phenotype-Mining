 OBJECTIVE: Incretin-based therapies, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, are the latest addition to the range of available medications for the management of patients with type 2 diabetes. The GLP-1 analog liraglutide has been approved for use in Europe and the US for over a year and has undergone evaluation in several pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics studies and in an extensive phase 3 clinical program. The aim of this review is to assess the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of the phase 3 data. METHODS: Data are presented from the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies of liraglutide and from nine published phase 3 studies, including the six Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD) studies. RESULTS: Liraglutide is effective at improving indices of glycemic control, and has a good tolerability and safety profile. Beneficial effects on weight (mean reduction of 1-3.4 kg) and blood pressure (systolic blood pressure decreased by 2.1-6.7 mmHg) are also observed. CONCLUSION: Liraglutide is an effective and well tolerated option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
