Gender plays a pivotal role in the onset as well as in the progression of the cardiovascular disease with a higher morbidity and mortality being detected in men with respect to women. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) may reduce gender-related differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease by fading the vascular protective effects afforded by estrogen in females. This article will discuss the role of sex and sex hormones on the incidence and mechanisms involved in vascular dysfunction associated to T2DM, which might explain why women with T2DM lack the vascular protection.
