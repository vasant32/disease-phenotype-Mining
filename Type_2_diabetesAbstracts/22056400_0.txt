 AIM: The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess the clinical effectiveness of exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes in routine clinical practice. METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control were commenced on exenatide in an out-patient setting. Effects on Hba1c, weight and BMI at 3- and 6-month intervals were recorded by a retrospective review of medical records. RESULTS: We examined a cross-section of 61 patients. The mean weight at treatment initiation was 114 kg and baseline Hba1c was 9.8% (84 mmol/mol). Mean reduction in Hba1c at 3 months was 0.8% (10 mmol/mol, P < 0.01) and mean reduction at 6 months was 0.5% (6 mmol/mol, P < 0.05). Mean weight loss at 3 months was 4.2 kg (P < 0.0001) and at 6 months was 6.6 kg (P < 0.0001). Seventeen patients were prescribed exenatide in addition to insulin, against current guidelines. This cohort of patients showed a greater mean reduction in weight (7.4 vs 6.2 kg) as compared to the group on exenatide without insulin, but mean Hba1c increased at 6 months by 0.35% (4 mmol/mol). CONCLUSION: Adjunctive exenatide treatment in patients with suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes on oral hypoglycaemic medications, achieved reductions in Hba1c and weight, in line with published studies. However, in patients already on insulin, favourable results can be achieved by the addition of exenatide by careful patient selection and follow-up.
