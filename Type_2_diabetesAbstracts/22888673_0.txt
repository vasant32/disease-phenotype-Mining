Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a main noninfectious disease, making significant influence on patients quality of life and life time. The medico-social role of diabetes is defined by wide prevalence of a disease in population and high risk of development of incapacitating complications. Therefore, considerable efforts of modern medicine focused on the study of etio-pathogenetic mechanism and the possibility of dietetic correction in this disease. In this review discusses efficacy of dietary therapy in type 2 diabetes, the role of insulin-like growth 1 (IGF-1)/insulin of pathogenesis microvascular complications. The role of inflammation in the development of microvascular complications, in the first place cytokines, act on the insulin signal pathway and affect the intracellular inflammatory kinase cascade was shown. Also, it is shown that adipose tissue inflammation modulates B-cell function and promotes progressive reduction of insulin secretion. When blood glucose levels are elevated, Glucagon-like peptide--1 stimulates insulin secretion, decrease glucagon secretion, improve B-cell function, and slows gastric emptying. It determines the necessity of fulfillment of further researches of cellular and humoral immunity in diabetes mellitus and the development of personal methods in prevention and treatment of this disease.
