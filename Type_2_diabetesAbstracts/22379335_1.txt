We aimed; 1) to determine the validity of the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) for the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of Korean patients with type 2 diabetes, and 2) to identify associated factors of the HRQOL of these patients. Follow-up surveys were conducted for consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes. HRQOL was assessed using the EQ-5D and the Short Form-36 (SF-36). The validity of EQ-5D was assessed with the perspectives of known group, convergent and discriminant validity. Additionally, a linear mixed model using a backward elimination was used for identify associated factors. Of the 1,072 patients included in the first survey, 858 (80.0%) completed the questionnaires in the follow-up. In the known group validity, the problem rates in each EQ-5D dimension were highest among women, elderly people, and less-educated subjects. The Spearman's œÅ between the EQ-5D and the SF-36 scales were larger in the comparable dimensions than those in the less comparable dimensions. In the final model, we found that sex, age, education, body mass index, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and retinopathy were statistically significant. Our data suggest that the EQ-5D is a valid tool for Korean patients with type 2 diabetes and that various factors could affect their HRQOL.
