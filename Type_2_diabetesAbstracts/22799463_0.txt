Introduction:  Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have been used in clinical management of type 2 diabetes since 2005. Currently approved agents were initially developed and approved for combination therapy with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). The potential for combined use with insulin has garnered increasing attention due to the potential to reduce side effects associated with insulin therapy and improve glycemic control.     Areas covered:  We reviewed published and other publicly released data from controlled and uncontrolled studies that included subjects treated with insulin/GLP-1 analog combination therapy. The currently available guidance for clinical practice when combining insulin and GLP-1 analogs was also summarized.     Expert opinion:  Limited data currently available from placebo-controlled trials support the use of exenatide twice daily or liraglutide once daily in combination with basal insulin and metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes unable to attain treatment goals. Several randomized controlled trials are currently studying combinations of insulin with various GLP-1 analogs. Additional guidance on the clinical use of these combinations will likely be forthcoming once these studies are reported. Insulin/GLP-1 analog combinations will require optimization of blood glucose monitoring strategies and delivery systems to decrease the risk of administration errors and reduce the potential complexity of these regimens.
