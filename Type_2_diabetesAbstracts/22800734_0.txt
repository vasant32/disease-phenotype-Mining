BACKGROUND & AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between eating speed and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A case-control study included 234 cases with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 468 non diabetic controls. A specifically designed questionnaire was used to collect information on possible risk factors of type 2 diabetes. The speed of eating was self-reported by study subjects compared to other subjects, with whom they were eating at the same table. The odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for type 2 diabetes were calculated by a conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Variables such as a family history on diabetes, body mass index, waist circumference, educational level, morning exercise, smoking and plasma triglycerides level were retained in multivariate logistic regression models as confounders because their inclusion changed the value of the OR by more than 5% in any exposure category. After adjustment for possible confounders more than two-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes was determined for subjects eating faster (OR = 2.52; 95% CI 1.56-4.06) vs. subjects eating slower. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support a possible relationship between faster eating speed and the increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
