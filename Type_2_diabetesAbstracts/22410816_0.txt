 OBJECTIVE: Megalin, an endocytic receptor in proximal tubule cells, is involved in the mechanisms of albuminuria in diabetic nephropathy (DN). To develop efficient novel biomarkers associated with the pathogenesis of DN, we investigated urinary megalin excretion in type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems were established with monoclonal antibodies against the NH(2) (amino [A]-megalin assay) and COOH (C-megalin assay) termini of megalin to analyze urinary forms of megalin in 68 patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: The A-megalin assay mainly detected a megalin ectodomain form in the soluble urinary fraction, whereas the C-megalin assay identified a full-length form in both soluble and insoluble fractions. Urinary C-megalin levels were significantly high in patients with normoalbuminuria, were elevated in line with increased albuminuria, and showed a better association with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) than did urinary albumin. In contrast, urinary A-megalin levels were increased in patients with normo- and microalbuminuria but not in those with macroalbuminuria. Urinary C-megalin levels were also positively associated with plasma inorganic phosphate and negatively with hemoglobin levels in those showing no features of bleeding and not taking vitamin D analogs, phosphate binders, or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary full-length megalin excretion as measured by the C-megalin assay is well associated with reduced eGFR and linked to the severity of DN, phosphate dysregulation, and anemia, whereas urinary excretion of megalin ectodomain as measured by the A-megalin assay may be associated with distinctive mechanisms of earlier DN in type 2 diabetes.
