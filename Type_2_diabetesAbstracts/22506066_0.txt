 BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in populations of European ancestry have mapped a type 2 diabetes susceptibility region to chromosome 10q23.33 containing IDE, KIF11 and HHEX genes (IDE-KIF11-HHEX), which has also been replicated in Chinese populations. However, the functional relevance for genetic variants at this locus is still unclear. It is critical to systematically assess the relationship of genetic variants in this region with the risk of type 2 diabetes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A fine-mapping study was conducted by genotyping fourteen tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 290-kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) region using a two-stage case-control study of type 2 diabetes in a Chinese Han population. Suggestive associations (P<0.05) observed from 1,200 cases and 1,200 controls in the first stage were further replicated in 1,725 cases and 2,081 controls in the second stage. Seven tagging SNPs were consistently associated with type 2 diabetes in both stages (P<0.05), with combined odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.14 to 1.33 in the combined analysis. The most significant locus was rs7923837 [OR = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-1.47] at the 3'-flanking region of HHEX gene. SNP rs1111875 was found to be another partially independent locus (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.13-1.35) in this region that was associated with type 2 diabetes risk. A cumulative effect of rs7923837 and rs1111875 was observed with individuals carrying 1, 2, and 3 or 4 risk alleles having a 1.27, 1.44, and 1.73-fold increased risk, respectively, for type 2 diabetes (P for trend = 4.1E-10). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results confirm that genetic variants of the IDE-KIF11-HHEX region at 10q23.33 contribute to type 2 diabetes susceptibility and suggest that rs7923837 may represent the strongest signal related to type 2 diabetes risk in the Chinese Han population.
