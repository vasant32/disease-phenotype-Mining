BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Good glycaemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus often requires insulin supplementation therapy. Recent developments of analogue insulin and premixed formulations have increased the therapeutic options for patients who need such therapy. This study aimed to retrospectively clarify appropriate treatment regimens according to age, body mass index (BMI) and duration of diabetes in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes previously entered in an open-label, randomized trial that compared convenience-oriented biphasic insulin aspart 30 versus multiple injections of insulin aspart with or without NPH insulin. METHODS: Japanese insulin-na√Øve patients were randomized to receive either biphasic insulin aspart 30 twice daily or insulin aspart three times daily with or without multiple injections of NPH insulin for a treatment period lasting 6 months. RESULTS: Reduction of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) at the end of 6 months was not different in the two treatment groups irrespective of BMI, age and duration of diabetes. However, the achievement rate of HbA(1c) <7.0% was significantly higher in patients with a BMI <25 kg/m2 in the multiple-injection group and tended to be higher in patients with a diabetes duration <10 years in the twice-daily injection group. CONCLUSION: Twice-daily injections of biphasic insulin aspart 30 may be more suitable for obese patients whereas multiple injections of insulin aspart with or without NPH insulin may be preferable for those with a longer duration of diabetes.
