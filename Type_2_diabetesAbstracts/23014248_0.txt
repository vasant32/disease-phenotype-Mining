 AIMS: Inflammation is postulated to play a role in diabetogenesis and its further vascular complications. The aim was to assess the inflammatory and lipid parameters in patients of type 2 diabetic mellitus with or without complication. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), nitric oxide metabolite (NO(X)), fibrinogen, and lipid parameters were measured in eighty type 2 diabetic males (40-65 years) without (n=40, group B) and with complication (16 retinopathy, group C; 24 hypertension, group D); and compared with 40 healthy, age and sex matched nondiabetic males (group A) from the general population. RESULT: The mean age of subjects and fasting plasma glucose among groups A, B, and C+D were 51.0±7.1 vs. 48.7±5.7 vs. 50.2±6.1 years (p>0.05); and 96.7±10.4 vs. 134.3±27.8 vs. 136.4±29.8mg/dl (p<0.001) respectively. Patients with retinopathy were older, with longer duration of diabetes, and high fasting plasma glucose (p<0.001). The mean hs-CRP, NO(X), fibrinogen, TC, TG, and LDL(C) varied significantly (p<0.001) between control and diabetics. hs-CRP, NO(X), and fibrinogen were found to be highest in retinopathy group whereas no significant (p>0.05) difference was noted between groups B and D in relation to hs-CRP and NO(X). TC and LDL(C) were significantly (p<0.001) high among group B patients. Significant positive correlation was observed between all three inflammatory markers in all categories of patients; between FPG, hs-CRP, and fibrinogen among patients with hypertension; between FPG, hs-CRP, and NO(X) in patients with retinopathy. However, none of the lipid parameters showed any significant correlation with any of the inflammatory markers in any group of patients studied. CONCLUSION: Low grade systemic inflammation, in association with dyslipidemia, plays a role in diabetogenesis and its complications.
