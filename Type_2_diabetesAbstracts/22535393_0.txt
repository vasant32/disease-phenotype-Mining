RT-qPCR  was used to analyze the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene TaqI polymorphism in 100  Turkish patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension compared  with 100 healthy subjects, to determine whether VDR could be considered as one  of the susceptibility genes for T2DM and hypertension. Genotyping was done with  PCR, followed by melting curve analysis with specific fluorescent hybridization  probes. The results showed that distributions for TT, Tt and tt genotypes were  51, 46 and 3% in the patient group, and 35, 49 and 16% in the control group,  respectively. The frequency of the T allele in patients was also significantly  higher than that in controls. Based on the results, the relationship between  the VDR gene TaqI polymorphism and T2DM patients in the Turkish population was  compared. In terms of the genotype distributions and allele frequencies of the  VDR gene TaqI polymorphism, there was no statistically significant difference  (P > 0.05) between the T2DM and hypertension patients and controls.  Application of RT-qPCR method enabled us to assess the prevalence of the VDR  gene TaqI polymorphism and its association with type 2 diabetes and  hypertension.
