Abstract Background: The aim of this study was to determine the ability of glycated hemoglobin (GHb) to predict metabolic syndrome in an Iranian population with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Methods: A cross-sectional study of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of patients with type 2 diabetes was conducted from 2003 to 2005. A total of 1386 FDRs of consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes 30-60 years old (355 men and 1031 women) with NGT were examined. All subjects underwent a standard 75-gram 2-h oral glucose tolerance test and GHb measurement. Consensus criteria in 2009 were used to identify metabolic syndrome. Unadjusted and adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk of metabolic syndrome. The mean [standard deviation (SD)] age of participants was 42.4 (6.3) years. Results: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 17.5% in men and 21.5% in women. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of metabolic syndrome was 2.01 (1.03, 3.93) for the highest quintile of GHb compared with lowest quintile. These data indicate that GHb was associated with metabolic syndrome, independently of gender among FDRs of patients with type 2 diabetes with NGT. Conclusions: These data indicate that GHb below the level for prediabetes might be a predictive measure of metabolic syndrome in FDRs of patients with type 2 diabetes with NGT.
