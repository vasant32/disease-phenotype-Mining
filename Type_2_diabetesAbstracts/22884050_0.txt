 BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) is the main surgical procedure used in type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the different types of GBP in treatment of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into two groups: those who underwent gastrojejunal loop anastomosis bypass and those who underwent gastrojejunal Roux-en-Y bypass. Blood glucose alterations, operation time, and operation complications were observed. RESULTS: Gastrojejunal loop anastomosis bypass and gastrojejunal Roux-en-Y bypass were both effective in the treatment of selected patients with type 2 diabetes. Compared with gastrojejunal Roux-en-Y bypass, gastrojejunal loop anastomosis bypass had the advantages of easier implementation, shorter operation time, and fewer operation complications. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrojejunal loop anastomosis is effective in treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is safe, easy to implement, and worthy of clinical popularization.
