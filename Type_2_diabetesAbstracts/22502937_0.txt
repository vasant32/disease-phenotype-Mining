 OBJECTIVES: Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common non-communicable diseases globally. This study seeks to estimate the prevalence of impaired fasting glycemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus in genetically isolated populations in Jordan: the Circassians and Chechans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were analyzed from a cross-sectional study that included a random sample of adult Circassians and Chechans. A subject was defined as affected by diabetes mellitus if diagnosis was known to patient or, according to the American Diabetes Association definition. Impaired fasting glucose was defined as a fasting serum glucose level of â‰¥6.1 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) but <7 mmol/L. HbA(1c) >7% was defined as 'unsatisfactory' metabolic control. RESULTS: The prevalence of impaired fasting glycemia was 18.5% for Circassians and 14.6% for Chechans. Prevalence of diabetes was 9.6% for Circassians and 10.1% for Chechans. The prevalence of impaired fasting glycemia and diabetes were significantly higher in men, older age groups, married, subjects of lower educational level, past smokers, and subjects with obesity. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was the most common abnormality in the two populations. CONCLUSIONS: The homogenous, genetically isolated Circassian and Chechan populations sharing the same environmental influences suggest a role for genetic risk factors for diabetes. Thus these two populations are suitable for additional genetics studies that may lead to the identification of novel risk factors for type 2 diabetes. In addition, more than half of patients with diabetes were with unsatisfactory control. Therefore, they are likely to benefit from programs encouraging healthy weight and physical activity.
