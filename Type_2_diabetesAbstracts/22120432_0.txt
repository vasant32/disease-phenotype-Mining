 PURPOSE: To determine whether there is an association between antidepressant use and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis using the Texas Medicaid prescription claims database. Data were extracted for new users of either antidepressant agents (exposed) or benzodiazepines (unexposed) from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2009. Patients aged 18-64 years without a prior history of diabetes were included. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the association between diabetes incidence among exposed and unexposed groups, while controlling for demographic and clinical covariates. RESULTS: Among the total study population (N = 44,715), the majority were in the exposed (N = 35,552) versus the unexposed (N = 9,163) group. A total of 2,943 patients (6.6%) developed type 2 diabetes during the follow-up period. Antidepressant use was associated with an increase in the risk of diabetes when compared to benzodiazepine use (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.558, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.401-1.734). The association was observed with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; HR 1.759, 95% CI 1.517-2.040), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; HR 1.566. 95% CI 1.351-1.816), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; HR 1.481, 95% CI 1.318-1.665), and "other" antidepressants (HR 1.376; 95% CI 1.198-1.581). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that antidepressant use is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. This association was observed with use of TCAs, SNRIs, SSRIs, and "other" antidepressants.
