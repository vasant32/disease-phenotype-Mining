 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe how women handle necessary lifestyle changes due to a chronic disease using diabetes as a model. DESIGN: Interview study. SETTING: Ten women living in western Sweden were interviewed. METHOD: In-depth interviews and analysis were performed using the phenomenological ideas of Giorgi. SUBJECTS: Ten women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, mean age 65. All were either on disability pension or retired with varying complications ranging from none to stroke. RESULTS: The findings revealed five themes: the ambiguous feeling of others' involvement, becoming a victim of pressurizing demands, experiencing knowledge deficits, experiencing an urge, and finding reasons to justify not changing. The invariant meaning of a continuous inner struggle illuminates the experience of making lifestyle changes for women with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study show that it is vital for health care professionals to treat women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with great respect and understanding regarding the struggle that they are going through. By being aware of the everyday burden for these women, acknowledging the fact that they want their lives to go on as before, may serve as a "key" to assist women in changing attitudes towards living in accordance with the disease and appreciating the lifestyle changes as a challenge as they become healthier and improve their quality of life.
