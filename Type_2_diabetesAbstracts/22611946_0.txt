 OBJECTIVE: To explore the synergistic effect between diabetes family history and abnormal waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) on the incidence of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Population-based case-control study was conducted. The interaction between diabetes family history and abnormal WHR was analysed by an additive model. RESULTS: After adjusting confounding factors by multiple logistic regression analysis, the synergy index was 5.63, the attributable risk was 1.49, and the attributable interaction percent was 52.9%. CONCLUSION: There was a synergistic effect between diabetes family history and abnormal WHR on the incidence of type 2 diabetes.
