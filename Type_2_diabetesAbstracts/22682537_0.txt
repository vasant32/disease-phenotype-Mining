 UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The relationship between body composition parameters such as thigh and calf circumference and insulin resistance or atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between insulin resistance, atherosclerosis, and thigh and calf circumference in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A total of 4,427 subjects with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. Insulin sensitivity was assessed according the rate constant for plasma glucose disappearance (Kitt) determined via the short insulin tolerance test. Biochemical and anthropometric profiles were measured according to a standardized protocol. Visceral fat thickness and carotid intima media thickness (IMT) were measured by ultrasonography. RESULTS: Insulin sensitivity index (Kitt) was significantly correlated with weight adjusted thigh and calf circumference. Thigh circumference was inversely associated with IMT in men and women and calf circumference was negatively correlated with IMT in women. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that thigh circumference was independently correlated with insulin sensitivity index (Kitt) and IMT. Furthermore, in multivariate logistic regression analysis, thigh circumference was an independent determinant factor for carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes even after adjusting for other cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Thigh and calf circumference were correlated with insulin resistance and carotid atherosclerosis, and thigh circumference was independently associated with insulin resistance and carotid atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes.
