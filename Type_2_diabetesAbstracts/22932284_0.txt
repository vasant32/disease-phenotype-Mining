Recent studies have revealed that diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of fractures. In type 1 diabetes, bone mineral density (BMD) is decreased. However, fracture risk is increased more than expected from the degree of BMD decrease. In type 2 diabetes, fracture risk is increased despite high BMD. Taken together, in diabetes, factors other than BMD, or derangements in bone quality, are major causes for bone fragility. In this review, various aspects of deranged bone and mineral metabolism in diabetes are reviewed. Treatment for osteoporosis is highly warranted in diabetic patients who have multiple risks for fractures.
