We examined possible anticancer effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) in 6074 Chinese with Type 2 diabetes free of cancer at enrolment. During a median follow-up of 4.93 years, 270 patients developed cancer. Use of TZDs was associated with reduced risk of cancer in a dose-response manner in multivariable analysis.
