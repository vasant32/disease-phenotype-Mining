Abstract The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between powerlessness, social support, and glycemic control in Korean adults with type 2 diabetes, taking into consideration their demographic characteristics. A total of 124 adults with type 2 diabetes answered the questionnaires of powerlessness and social support. Glycemic control was measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C). Powerlessness score differed significantly with gender, age, and occupation, social support score with education, occupation, and income, and HbA1C level with age and income. The relationship between glycemic control and powerlessness was not significant, but the one between powerlessness and social support was negative. In conclusion higher level of powerlessness was significantly related to having less social support. Based on this outcome, it is necessary to develop, for Korean adults with type 2 diabetes, an intervention program that improves their social support, which in turn reduces their powerlessness.
