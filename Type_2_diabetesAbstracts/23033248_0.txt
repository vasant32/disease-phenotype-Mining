OBJECTIVEHeart failure is common in individuals with type 2 diabetes and early detection of individuals at risk may offer opportunities for prevention. We aimed to explore: 1) prospective associations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in a non-heart failure range with changes in markers of left ventricular (LV) function, and 2) possible effect modification by type 2 diabetes in a population-based cohort.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSEchocardiographic measurements were performed at baseline (2000-2001) and follow-up (2007-2009), together with standardized physical examinations and BNP measurements on 300 individuals (mean age 66 years, 32% with type 2 diabetes) of the longitudinal Hoorn Study. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to investigate associations of baseline BNP (<100 pg/mL) in individuals without prevalent heart failure at baseline with changes in LV mass index, LV ejection fraction, left atrial volume index, and ratio of early diastolic LV inflow velocity (E) to early diastolic lengthening velocity (e') (E/e').RESULTSIn all individuals, higher BNP was associated with 8-year increases in left atrial volume index. Higher BNP was also associated with increasing LV mass index and E/e'. These associations were significantly stronger in individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with the nonsignificant associations in individuals without type 2 diabetes.CONCLUSIONSThis 8-year follow-up study shows that higher BNP levels in a non-heart failure range were associated with an increased LV mass and deteriorated LV diastolic function, particularly in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This implies that the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes should be taken into account if BNP levels are used to assess future heart failure risk.
