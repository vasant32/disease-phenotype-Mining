The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased markedly worldwide. A recent epidemiological study reported that approximately 63% of T2DM patients also have high blood pressure (>130/80 mmHg), which doubles their risk of cardiac events. Of the medications used to treat T2DM, the incretins are a group of peptides that not only regulate blood glucose effectively and moderately, but also protect patients against cardiovascular events and improve several cardiovascular parameters. Here were review data from preclinical and short- and long-term clinical studies investigating the antihypertensive effects of incretins. We also elucidate four possible mechanisms underlying the antihypertensive effects of incretins. We conclude that incretins can lower blood pressure of T2DM patients, independent of weight loss, and will surely improve the prognosis of these patients.
