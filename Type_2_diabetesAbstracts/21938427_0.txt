To determine whether leptin receptor (LEPR) 223A>G polymorphism has an effect on the plasma leptin levels and the macroangiopathic complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The genotypes and allelic frequencies of the LEPR 223A>G were examined with polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism in 301 patients with T2DM and 172 unrelated healthy subjects. The plasma concentrations of leptin were determined in all subjects. The mean plasma leptin levels in the T2DM group were significantly higher than that of controls and the plasma levels of leptin were higher in diabetic patients with macroangiopathy than in patients without macroangiopathy (P < 0.05). The genotype (GG, AG and AA) distribution of 223A>G polymorphism was 58.3, 32.5, and 9.2% in diabetic patients with macroangiopathy, 75.3, 22.1, and 2.6% in patients without macroangiopathy, and 70.3, 27.5, 2.2% in controls respectively, a significant difference was found between diabetic patients with and without macroangiopathy (P < 0.05). The frequency of the allele A was higher in patients with macroangiopathy than in patients without macroangiopathy (25.6 vs. 16.3%; P < 0.05). Moreover, the plasma leptin levels were markedly higher in patients with AA genotype than those with AG or GG genotype in patients with macroangiopathy (P < 0.05). The LEPR 223A>G gene polymorphism associated with a predisposition to increased plasma leptin levels could constitute a useful predictive marker for diabetic macroangiopathy.
