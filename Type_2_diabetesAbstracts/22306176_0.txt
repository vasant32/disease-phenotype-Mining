 AIMS: To assess the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among employees of a Finnish airline; to study the association of shift work with T2D and CVD risk; and to test the feasibility of risk screening in occupational health care setting. METHODS: Altogether 4169 employees were invited for a health check-up and 2312 participated in this study. The check-up included physical examinations, questionnaires on working hours, sleep, and lifestyle, diabetes risk score FINDRISC, and blood tests. Lifestyle counselling was offered for those with increased T2D risk. RESULTS: Altogether 15% of participants had a high T2D risk (FINDRISCâ‰¥15 and/or elevated, but non-diabetic blood glucose), and a further 15% had a moderate T2D risk (FINDRISC 10-14 and normal blood glucose). Of those 60% agreed to attend lifestyle counselling. Metabolic syndrome was more common, lipid profile more unfavorable and hsCRP higher by increasing FINDRISC score category. Risk factor profiles linked to shift work status were not self-evident. CONCLUSIONS: The renewed health check-up process effectively identified those employees with increased T2D and CVD risk who would benefit from lifestyle intervention. The use of FINDRISC questionnaire was a feasible first-step screening method in occupational health care setting.
