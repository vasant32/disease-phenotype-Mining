 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has revised criteria for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes recommending an A1C cut point of ≥6.5% in addition to criteria based on glucose levels. We compared A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-h post-challenge glucose (2-hPG) criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in a cohort of Italian Caucasians. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1019 individuals without known diabetes completed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and had A1C measured. Moderate agreement existed for A1C and FPG criteria for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (κ coefficient = 0.522), with 85.5% of individuals classified as not having diabetes by both A1C and FPG criteria, and 5.8% classified as having diabetes by both A1C and FPG criteria. Discordant classifications occurred for 5.5% of individuals who had an A1C ≥ 6.5% and FPG <126 mg dl(-1), and for 3.2% who had an A1C <6.5% and FPG ≥126 mg dl(-1). Modest agreement existed for A1C and 2-hPG criteria for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (κ coefficient = 0.427), with 81.8% of individuals classified as not having diabetes by both A1C and 2-hPG criteria, and 6.0% classified as having diabetes by both A1C and 2-hPG criteria. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of A1C for identifying subjects with diabetes according to FPG or 2-hPG criteria was 0.856 and 0.794, respectively. Modest agreement existed for A1C and FPG and/or 2-hPG criteria for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (κ coefficient = 0.446). CONCLUSIONS: A1C ≥ 6.5% demonstrates a moderate agreement with fasting glucose and 2-hPG for diagnosing diabetes among adult Italian Caucasians subjects.
