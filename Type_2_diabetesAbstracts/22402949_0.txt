Whereas many studies have implicated metabolic liver dysfunction as a causative factor for obesity-related type 2 diabetes and the Metabolic Syndrome, its role as a long-term complication of diabetic metabolism is still mostly unexplored.In contrast to the well-described late diabetic micro- and macro-vascular complications in response to hyperglycemic conditions such as nephro- and retinopathy as well as atherosclerosis, only recent studies have highlighted disturbances of liver function as a novel aspect of diabetic late complications that may substantially impact the overall disease outcome and determine mortality rates in diabetic subjects. Here we will discuss recent developments in this area, particularly focusing on transcriptional regulators of hepatic dysfunction as a long-term consequence of established diabetes.
