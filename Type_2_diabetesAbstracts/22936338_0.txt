Closed flexor tendon rupture is an unusual condition that has been described in association with distinct underlying disease processes. Several theories have been implicated in the pathogenesis, including labor-associated forceful usage, gender, and age. The effect of diabetes on the native tendon tissue is not yet fully understood; however, the metabolic perturbations of diabetes have been shown to result in detrimental changes to the musculoskeletal system. We report an unusual case of bilateral spontaneous rupture of the flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus in a 58-year-old woman with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The clinical course, radiographic findings, and the biomechanical factors and mechanisms through which diabetes may affect the native tendon are presented.
