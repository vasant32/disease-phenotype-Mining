<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to identify microaberrations characterized by loss or gain of genomic material that contribute to the EEC at a genome-wide level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular karyotyping, utilizing 549,839 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with an average spacing of 5.7 kilobases, was performed to screen an initial cohort of 16 patients with non-syndromic EEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A de novo microduplication involving chromosomal region 22q11.21 was identified in one patient with classic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100548'>exstrophy</z:hpo> of the bladder (CBE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was performed with an MLPA 22q11 kit in a further 50 non-syndromic EEC cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified one CBE patient with an overlapping 22q11.21 duplication in whom the duplication had been transmitted from the unaffected mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal region 22q11 is well known for its susceptibility to genomic rearrangements, and these are associated with various syndromes including the velo-cardio-facial/<z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp> (VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>), the der(22) syndrome, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat-eye syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Duplications in this region result in a wide and variable spectrum of clinical presentations that include features of the VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>, while some carriers present with a completely <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings extend the phenotypic spectrum of the 22q11.2 duplication syndrome, and indicate that this aberration predisposes to CBE with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
