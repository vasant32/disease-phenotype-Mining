<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a cytogenetic, molecular, and clinical study of patients with autosomal supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMC), 6 out of 72 (8.3%) were shown by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to be derived from chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PCR microsatellite analysis and FISH using primers and cosmids from proximal 22q showed 3 of the 6 to contain euchromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first, a de novo nonmosaic bisatellited, dicentric SMC, was acsertained in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009921'>Duane anomaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite analysis showed the SMC was maternal in origin with euchromatin extending to D22S427, i.e., proximal to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp> critical region (DGSCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second, a nonmosaic bisatellited, dicentric marker, was found in a child with severe <z:mp ids='MP_0004144'>hypotonia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> and had been inherited from the patient's phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FISH showed the SMC to contain euchromatin extending into the DGSCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third, a de novo SMC, was ascertained antenatally and was shown to contain 22q euchromatin extending distal to the DGSCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 19-week terminated fetus was phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of the three SMC(22)s not containing detectable proximal 22q euchromatin were ascertained coincidentally in phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, whereas the third, the only mosaic with a minority euploid cell line, was found in a patient with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SMC(22)s devoid of proximal 22q euchromatin are not associated with adverse phenotypic effects whereas SMC(22)s containing euchromatin may be found in individuals with phenotypes ranging from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
