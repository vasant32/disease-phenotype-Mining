<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The low-copy repeats on chromosome 22q11.2 (LCR22) are a complex mosaic of genes and pseudogenes formed by duplication processes; they mediate chromosome rearrangements associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">velo-cardio-facial syndrome</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp>, der(22) syndrome, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat-eye syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability to trace the substrates and products of recombination events provides a unique opportunity to identify the mechanisms responsible for shaping LCR22s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the genomic sequence of known LCR22 genes and their duplicated derivatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found Alu (SINE) elements at the breakpoints in the substrates and at the junctions in the truncated products of recombination for USP18, GGT, and GGTLA, consistent with Alu-mediated unequal crossing-over events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we were able to trace a likely interchromosomal Alu-mediated fusion between IGSF3 on 1p13.1 and GGT on 22q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Breakpoints occurred inside Alu elements as well as in the 5' or 3' ends of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A possible stimulus for the 5' or 3' terminal rearrangements may be the high sequence similarities between different Alu elements, combined with a potential recombinogenic role of retrotransposon target-site duplications flanking the Alu element, containing potentially kinkable DNA sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such sites may represent focal points for recombination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, genome shuffling by Alu-mediated rearrangements has contributed to genome architecture during primate evolution </plain></SENT>
