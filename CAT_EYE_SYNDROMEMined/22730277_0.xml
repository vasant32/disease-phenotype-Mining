<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the clinical and molecular findings of a 9-month-old girl with features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> and also a palpable midline neck mass proved to be an extragonadal mature <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo>, additionally characterized by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS High resolution oligonucleotide-based aCGH confirmed that the supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) derived from chromosome 22, as was indicated by molecular cytogenetic analysis with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, aCGH clarified the size, breakpoints, and gene content of the duplication (dup 22q11.1q11.21; size:1.6 Mb; breakpoints: 15,438,946-17,041,773; hg18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> tissue was also tested with aCGH, in which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> duplication was not found, but the analysis revealed three aberrations: del Xp22.3 (108,864-2788,689; 2.7 Mb hg18), dup Yp11.2 (6688,491-7340,982; 0.65 Mb, hg18), and dup Yq11.2q11.23 (12,570,853-27,177,133; 14.61 Mb, hg18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicated 46 XY (male) karyotype of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> tissue, making this the second report of mature extragonadal <z:hpo ids='HP_0009792'>teratoma</z:hpo> in a female neonate, probably deriving from an included dizygotic twin of opposite sex (fetus in fetu) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Our findings extend the phenotypic spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> syndrome, a disorder with clinical variability, pointing out specific dosage-sensitive genes that might contribute to specific phenotypic features </plain></SENT>
