<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The supernumerary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome (CES)</z:e> chromosome is dicentric, containing two copies of 22pter--&gt;q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have found that the duplication breakpoints are clustered in two intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The more proximal, most common interval is the 450-650 kb region between D22S427 and D22S36, which corresponds to the proximal deletion breakpoint interval found in the 22q11 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">velocardiofacial syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The more distal duplication breakpoint interval <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> between CRKL and D22S112, which overlaps with the common distal deletion interval of the 22q11 deletion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have therefore classified <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> chromosomes into two types based on the location of the two breakpoints required to generate them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The smaller type I <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> chromosomes are symmetrical, with both breakpoints located within the proximal interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The larger type II <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> chromosomes are either asymmetrical, with one breakpoint located in each of the two intervals, or symmetrical, with both breakpoints located in the distal interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The co-localization of the breakpoints of these different syndromes, plus the presence of low-copy repeats adjacent to each interval, suggests the existence of several specific regions of <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> in 22q11.2 which are involved in the production of both deletions and duplications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since the phenotype associated with the larger duplication does not appear to be more severe than that of the smaller duplication, determination of the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> chromosome does not currently have prognostic value </plain></SENT>
