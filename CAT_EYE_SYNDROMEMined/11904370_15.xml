<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a protein family in Drosophila containing six <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase-related growth factors (ADGFs), which are homologous to a mitogenic growth factor discovered in conditioned medium from cells of a different fly species, Sarcophaga </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Closely related proteins have been identified in other animals, and a human homolog is implicated in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disease</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat-Eye Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two most abundantly expressed ADGFs in Drosophila larvae are ADGF-A, which is strongly expressed in the gut and lymph glands, and ADGF-D, which is mainly expressed in the fat body and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recombinant ADGF-A and ADGF-D are active <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminases (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADAs</z:chebi>), and they cause polarization and serum-independent proliferation of imaginal disk and embryonic cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enzymatic activity of these proteins is required for their mitogenic function, making them unique among growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A culture medium prepared without <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, or depleted of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> by using bovine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="39048">ADA</z:chebi>, also stimulates proliferation of imaginal disk cells, and addition of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> to this medium inhibits proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus ADGFs secreted in vivo may control tissue growth by modulating the level of extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
