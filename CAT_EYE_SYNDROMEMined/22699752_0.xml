<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The formation of γ-H2AX foci after DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for the cellular response to this lethal DNA damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously have shown that BRG1, a chromatin remodeling enzyme, facilitates DSB repair by stimulating γ-H2AX formation, and this function of BRG1 requires the binding of BRGI to acetylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15358">histone</z:chebi> H3 on γ-H2AX-containing nucleosomes using its bromodomain (BRD), a protein module that specifically recognizes <z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-Lys moieties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also have shown that the BRD of BRG1, when ectopically expressed in cells, functions as a dominant negative inhibitor of the BRG1 activity to stimulate γ-H2AX and DSB repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we found that BRDs from a select group of proteins have no such activity, suggesting that the γ-H2AX inhibition activity of BRG1 BRD is specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding led us to search for more BRDs that exhibit γ-H2AX inhibition activity in the hope of finding additional BRD-containing proteins involved in DNA damage responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We screened a total of 52 individual BRDs present in 38 human BRD-containing proteins, comprising 93% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> human BRDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We identified the BRD of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> chromosome region candidate 2 (Cecr2), which recently was shown to form a novel chromatin remodeling complex with unknown cellular functions, as having a strong γ-H2AX inhibition activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This activity of Cecr2 BRD is specific because it depends on the chromatin binding affinity of Cecr2 BRD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small interfering <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> knockdown experiments showed that Cecr2 is important for γ-H2AX formation and DSB repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our genomewide screen identifies Cecr2 as a novel DNA damage response protein </plain></SENT>
