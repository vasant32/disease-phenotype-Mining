<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only one gene, ATP6E, has been previously mapped to this duplicated region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now report the mapping of the human homologue of the apoptotic <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> Bid to human chromosome 22 near locus D22S57 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dosage analysis demonstrated that BID is located just distal to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> region critical for the majority of malformations associated with the syndrome (CESCR), as previously defined by a single patient with an unusual supernumerary chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, BID remains a good candidate for involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>mental impairment</z:hpo>, and its overexpression may subtly add to the phenotype of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our mapping of murine Bid confirms that the synteny of the CESCR and the 22q11 deletion syndrome critical region immediately telomeric on human chromosome 22 is not conserved in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bid and adjacent gene Atp6e were found to map to mousechromosome 6, while the region homologous to the DGSCR is known to map to mouse chromosome 16 </plain></SENT>
