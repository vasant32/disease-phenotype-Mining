<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we attempted to characterize the protein targets that may be related to peritoneal change in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> and have not exposed to peritoneal dialysis fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Protein profiles of peritoneal fluids collected from patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> and patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function receiving laparoscopic cholecystectomy were displayed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Altered protein spots were excised and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen 2-DE protein spots were altered between two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blots confirmed that kininogen-1, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inhibitor 2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> critical region protein 1, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I had higher expression levels in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009644'>uremia</z:mp> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, synaptic vesicle 2-related protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and envelope <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (C2-V5 region) showed lower levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increased expression may result from a change in the permeability of the peritoneal membrane to middle-sized proteins or <z:mp ids='MP_0003303'>peritoneal inflammation</z:mp> with proteins sloughing off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the identified proteins may provide a novel understanding of peritoneal changes caused by uremic toxins and may function as biomarkers or drug targets </plain></SENT>
