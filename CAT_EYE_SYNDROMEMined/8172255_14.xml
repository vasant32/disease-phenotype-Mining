<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The marker was studied by cytogenetic methods and non-isotopic in situ hybridization with the single D22S9 DNA probe which maps to 22q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The supernumerary chromosome was derived from a chromosome 22 and it did not present the same <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least 5 distinct types of the marker chromosome were detected and some of them were probably derived from each other (dynamic mosaicism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proposita had an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> pattern consistent with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e>, while her sister and her mother had some of the manifestations described in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A specific correlation could be established between phenotype and karyotype </plain></SENT>
