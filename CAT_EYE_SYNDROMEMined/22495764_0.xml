<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied a family with repeated transmission of mosaicism for a supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC), giving rise to varying symptoms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome (CES)</z:e> in the offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the SMC was investigated using FISH with probes from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> critical region on lymphocytes as well as buccal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same probes were used to study the frequency of the SMC in spermatozoa from the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SMC was characterized in detail using array-CGH and was found to correspond to a symmetrical cat eye SMC type I, with two extra copies of the most proximal part of 22q11, not extending into the classical 22q11.2 deletion region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mosaicism for the SMC was detected in 4 out of 7 family members, the father and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> his three children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of mosaicism varied greatly between individuals as well as between tissues, with twice as many cells with the SMC in epithelial cells compared to blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The highest frequency (almost 50%) was found in spermatozoa from the father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a direct correlation between the degree of mosaicism and the symptoms, varying from no obvious symptoms to classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study confirms the occurrence of direct transmission of SMC-mosaicism in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that examination of parental epithelial cells should be preferred compared to blood cells in order to exclude a recurrence risk in parents of a child with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Interphase FISH analysis of spermatozoa is the most sensitive method to exclude paternal germ line mosaicsm </plain></SENT>
