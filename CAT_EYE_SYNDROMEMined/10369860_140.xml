<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three congenital anomaly disorders, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat-eye syndrome</z:e>, der() syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">velo-cardio-facial syndrome</z:e>/<z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp> (VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>) are associated with tetrasomy, <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp>, respectively, for part of chromosome 22q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e> is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements, the deletion end-points in a large number of VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e> patients were defined by haplotype analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e> patients have a similar 3 Mb deletion, some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1.5 Mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To investigate this hypothesis, we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats, termed LCR22s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To support this idea further, we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 Mb region that is deleted in VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We present models to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events, thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We identified five additional copies of the LCR22 on 22q11 that may mediate other rearrangements leading to disease </plain></SENT>
