<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inter-Alu PCR amplification yielded a series of human DNA fragments which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detected evolutionarily-conserved sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The centromere-most gene fragment candidate, XEN61, was shown to lie centromeric to the chromosome 22 breakpoint in the X/22-33-11TG somatic cell hybrid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This region, which is still devoid of characterized genes, overlaps with the critical region for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome (CES)</z:e>, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorder</z:e> associated with chromosomal duplication within 22pter-q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gene dosage analysis performed on DNA from six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> patients consistently revealed the presence of four copies of XEN61 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fetal brain cDNA clone, 61EW, was identified with XEN61 and entirely sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The deduced protein is the E subunit of vacuolar <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi>-ATPase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This 31 KDa component of a proton pump is essential in eukaryotic cells as it both controls acidification of the vacuolar system and provides it with its main protonmotive force </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR experiments using oligonucleotides designed from the 61EW cDNA sequence indicated that the corresponding messenger is widely transcribed </plain></SENT>
