<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Recent studies showed high frequency of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic alpha <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (PIK3CA) mutations in various human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>; notably, these mutations frequently locate in the hotspot mutation regions of PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 with functional significance in <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp>, invasion, and anti-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was to screen for mutations in the hotspot mutation regions of PIK3CA in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> (NPC), and explore the correlation of PIK3CA mutations to <z:mp ids='MP_0002006'>tumorigenesis</z:mp> of NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 in 46 specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> primary NPC tissues were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-clone sequencing; those in 46 samples of matched NPC peripheral blood and 3 NPC cell lines CNE1, CNE2, and SUNE1 were directly sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 46 specimens of NPC, 2 (4.3%) had point mutation in PIK3CA exon 9 [T1563G (521Asn--&gt;Lys) and A1646G (549Asp--&gt;Gly)], 18 had multiple mutations in PIK3CA exon 9 (A1634C-G1658C-del 1659T), which might be the homologous sequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat Eye Syndrome</z:e> region on 22q11.2; none had mutation in PIK3CA exon 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no mutation was detected in PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 in the 46 matched NPC peripheral blood samples and CNE1, CNE2, and SUNE1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 rarely mutate in NPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clone sequencing is more sensitive than direct sequencing in screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A1634C-G1658C-del 1659T mutations in PIK3CA exon 9, detected by clone sequencing, are supposed to be the homologous sequence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat Eye Syndrome</z:e> region on 22q11.2 instead of mutations in PIK3CA </plain></SENT>
