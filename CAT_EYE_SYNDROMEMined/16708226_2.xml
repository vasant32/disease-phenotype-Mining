<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of highly homologous sequences, known as low copy repeats, predisposes for unequal recombination within the 22q11 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This can lead to genomic imbalances associated with several known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a developmentally delayed patient carrying different rearrangements on both chromosome 22 homologues, including a previously unreported rearrangement within the 22q11 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One homologue carries a deletion of the proximal part of chromosome band 22q11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, a 'pure' deletion of this region has not been described previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four copies of this 22q11 region, however, are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat eye syndrome (CES)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the phenotypic impact of this deletion is unclear, familial investigation revealed five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> relatives carrying this deletion, suggesting that haplo-insufficiency of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> region has little clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other chromosome 22 homologue carries a duplication of the Velocardiofacial/<z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp> (VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>) region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, a previously undescribed deletion of 22q12.1, located in a relatively gene-poor region, was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the clinical features of patients suffering from a duplication of the VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e> region have proven to be extremely variable, it is impossible to postulate as to the contribution of the 22q12.1 deletion to the phenotype of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additional patients with a deletion within this region are needed to establish the consequences of this copy number alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the value of using different genomic approaches to unravel chromosomal alterations in order to study their phenotypic impact </plain></SENT>
