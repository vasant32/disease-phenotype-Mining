<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two individuals, a boy and girl, with a clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> had an extra bisatellited chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the girl, the diagnosis was made on the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>coloboma</z:hpo> of the right iris, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0004467'>preauricular pit</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0003130'>imperforate anus</z:mp>; in the boy, bilateral colobomata of the iris, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000494'>down-slanting palpebral fissures</z:hpo>, right <z:hpo ids='HP_0000384'>preauricular skin tag</z:hpo>, and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0004467'>preauricular pit</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple staining techniques were used to characterize the extra chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With G-banding the extra chromosome usually appeared monocentric with two major G-positive bands, but with satellites on both ends; with C-banding, two C-band positive regions were evident, indicating that the chromosomes were likely dicentric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Silver staining demonstrated the presence of NORs near each end; Q-banding showed satellites on each end, differing in brightness and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chromosomes of the parents were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; comparisons of Q-band heteromorphisms of the acrocentric chromosomes of the parents with those of the extra chromosome showed in each case one short arm/satellite region of the extra chromosome identical in appearance to one chromosome 22 of the mother and the other end of the extra bisatellited chromosome identical to the short arm/satellite of the mother's second chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This extra chromosome, then, is the result of a maternal meiotic error in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization studies using the chromosome 22-derived probe p22/34, which identifies locus D22S9, showed 16% of the cells from the female patient to have silver grains on the proximal long arm of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome 22 and 14% on the extra chromosome, while 10% of cells from the male had grains on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomes 22 and an equal number on the extra chromosome, confirming the chromosome 22 origin of the extra chromosome in these patients </plain></SENT>
