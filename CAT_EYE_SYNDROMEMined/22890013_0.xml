<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A small supernumerary marker chromosome (sSMC) derived from chromosome 22 is a relatively common cytogenetic finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This sSMC typically results in tetrasomy for a chromosomal region that spans the chromosome 22p arm and the proximal 2 Mb of 22q11.21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using classical cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and array techniques, 7 patients with sSMCs derived from chromosome 22 were studied: 4 non-related and 3 from the same family (mother, daughter, and son) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sSMCs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were dicentric and bisatellited chromosomes with breakpoints in the chromosome 22 low-copy repeat A region, resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome (CES)</z:e> due to chromosome 22 partial tetrasomy 22pterâ†’q11.2 including the cat eye chromosome region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects presented the same chromosomal abnormality, they showed a wide range of phenotypic differences, even in the 3 patients from the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There are no previous reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> occurring within 3 patients in the same family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the clinical and follow-up data presented here contribute to a better delineation of the phenotypes and outcomes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> patients and will be useful for genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
