<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this paper was to describe the clinical characteristics of a sample of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> who were seen at our service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of a sample of six patients with diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients’ karyotypes exhibited the presence of an additional marker chromosome, inv dup(22)(pter-&gt;q11.2::q11.2-&gt;pter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient also exhibited mosaicism with a lineage that had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosomal constitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical and follow-up data were collected from the patients’ medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the frequencies observed in our study with figures given in the literature (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main abnormalities observed were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000384'>preauricular tags</z:hpo> and/or pits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002023'>anal atresia</z:hpo> (both observed in 83% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000612'>Coloboma of the iris</z:hpo>, an important finding with this syndrome, was observed in two cases (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>Congenital heart disease</z:hpo> was detected in four patients (67%) and the main defect found was interatrial communication (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Uncommon findings included hemifacial microsomia combined with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0008551'>microtia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005912'>biliary atresia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Just one of these patients died, from <z:hpo ids='HP_0010310'>chylothorax</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The phenotype observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> is highly variable and may be superimposed on the phenotype of the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although these patients usually have good prognosis, including from a neurological point of view, we believe that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with the syndrome should be assessed very early on for the presence of cardiac, biliary and anorectal malformations, which may avoid possible complications in the future, including patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
