<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their precise characterization, particularly with respect to the latter quality, has proven elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An opportunity to explore this issue arises from the recent emergence of tiling-microarray data showing that intergenic regions (containing pseudogenes) are transcribed to a great degree </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we focus on the transcriptional activity of pseudogenes on human chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, we integrated several sets of annotation to define a unified list of 525 pseudogenes on the chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To characterize these further, we developed a comprehensive list of genomic features based on conservation in related organisms, expression evidence, and the presence of upstream regulatory sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 525 unified pseudogenes we could confidently classify 154 as processed and 49 as duplicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using data from tiling microarrays, especially from recent high-resolution oligonucleotide arrays, we found some evidence that up to a fifth of the 525 pseudogenes are potentially transcribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expressed sequence tags (EST) comparison further validated a number of these, and overall we found 17 pseudogenes with strong support for transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In particular, one of the pseudogenes with both EST and microarray evidence for transcription turned out to be a duplicated pseudogene in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although we could not identify a meaningful number of transcription factor-binding sites (based on chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip data) near pseudogenes, we did find that approximately 12% of the pseudogenes had upstream CpG islands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, analysis of corresponding syntenic regions in the mouse, rat and chimp genomes indicates, as previously suggested, that pseudogenes are less conserved than genes, but more preserved than the intergenic background (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> notation is available from http://www.pseudogene.org) </plain></SENT>
