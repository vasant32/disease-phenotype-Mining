<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Supernumerary marker chromosomes (SMCs) have a reported frequency in the prenatal and newborn population ranging from 0.04% to 0.08% and about 37% of diagnosed SMCs are associated with an abnormal phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Around 7.5% of them are derived from chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SMCs(22) that result in tri- or tetrasomy of band 22q11.2 are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat-eye syndrome (CES)</z:e>, a syndrome of variable penetrance and affectation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>-like phenotype has been also related to 22q11.2 interstitial duplications and der(22) syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 22q11.2 region, also involved in the velocardiofacial microdeletional syndrome, presents high susceptibility to chromosomal rearrangements due to the presence of low-copy repeats sequences (LCR22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another region in the genome rich in LCR is 17p and five recurrent disorders have been mapped on the region 17p11-p13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some chromosomal imbalances affecting the 17p13.3 subtelomeric region have been reported, related to cryptic unbalanced translocations and associated, in most cases, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> and dysmorphic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We report on a healthy male carrier of a SMC that was identified as a +der(22)t(17;22)(p13.3;q11.2) consequence of an abnormal 3:1 segregation of the paternal t(17;22) and we have determined the approximate size of the trisomic regions, comparing the obtained results with other reported imbalances involving 22q11.2 and 17pter </plain></SENT>
