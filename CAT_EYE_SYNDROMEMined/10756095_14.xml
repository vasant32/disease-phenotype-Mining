<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using exon trapping and genomic sequence analysis, we have isolated and characterized a gene, CECR1, that maps to this critical region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protein encoded by CECR1 is similar to previously identified novel growth factors: IDGF from Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly) and MDGF from Aplysia californica (sea hare) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CECR1 gene is alternatively spliced and expressed in numerous tissues, with most abundant expression in human adult heart, lung, lymphoblasts, and placenta as well as fetal lung, liver, and kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization of a human embryo shows specific expression in the outflow tract and atrium of the developing heart, the VII/VIII cranial nerve ganglion, and the notochord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The location of this gene in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> critical region and its embryonic expression suggest that the overexpression of CECR1 may be responsible for at least some features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>, particularly the heart defects </plain></SENT>
