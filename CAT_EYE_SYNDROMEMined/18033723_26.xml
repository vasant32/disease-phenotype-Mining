<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The current diagnostic procedure for detecting aberrations at 22q11.2 is chromosomal analysis coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or PCR-based multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there are copy number variations (CNVs) in 22q11.2 that are only detected by high-resolution platforms such as array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on development of a high-definition MLPA (MLPA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) 22q11 kit that detects copy number changes at 37 loci on the long arm of chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include the 3-Mb region commonly deleted in DiGeorge/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">velocardiofacial syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>/VCFS), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome (CES)</z:e> region, and more distal regions in 22q11 that have recently been shown to be deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have used this MLPA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> probe set to analyze 363 previously well-characterized samples with a variety of different rearrangements at 22q11 and demonstrate that it can detect copy number alterations with high sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to detection of the common recurrent deletions associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>/VCFS, variant and novel chromosome 22 aberrations have been detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These include duplications within as well as deletions distal to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, the MLPA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> detects deletion endpoint differences between patients with the common 3-Mb deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The MLPA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> kit is proposed as a cost effective alternative to the currently available detection methods for individuals with features of the 22q11 aberrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with the relevant phenotypic characteristics, this MLPA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> probe set could replace FISH for the clinical diagnosis of 22q11.2 deletions and duplications </plain></SENT>
