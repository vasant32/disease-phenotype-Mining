<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a male infant with a 47,XY, + der(22),t(1;22)(q32;q11)pat karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, he has duplication of chromosomes 1(q32----qter) and 22(pter----q11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients with dup 1(q32----qter) and eight with dup 1(q42----qter) have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These two groups of patients share several manifestations, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0008897'>postnatal growth retardation</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0004482'>relative macrocephaly</z:hpo> with widely separated sutures or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000239'>large fontanelles</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011220'>prominent forehead</z:hpo>; highly <z:mp ids='MP_0003761'>arched palate</z:mp>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo>; downward slant of the palpebral fissures; broad, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005280'>flat nasal bridge</z:hpo>; and apparently low-set, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000377'>malformed ears</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although many of these abnormalities are nonspecific, partial duplication of 1q should be considered in infants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004482'>relative macrocephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000239'>large fontanelles</z:hpo>, and downward slant of the palpebral fissures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our patient had duplication of the part of chromosome 22 that may be associated with the clinically variable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat-eye syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with dup 22(pter----q11) may also have downward slant of the palpebral fissures, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000347'>micrognathia</z:hpo>, and apparently low-set, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000377'>malformed ears</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The structural gene locus for beta-glucosidase has been mapped to chromosome 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>beta-Glucosidase activity in fibroblasts from our patient was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and his parents' activities were not significantly different from those of control individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, either the locus for this enzyme is not present on 1(q32----qter) or the enzyme does not consistently show a substantial gene-dose effect </plain></SENT>
