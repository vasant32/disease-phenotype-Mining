<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe an individual showing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> of a minute supernumerary double ring chromosome 22, which resulted in expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cardinal features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The size of the ring was determined by DNA dosage analysis and FISH analysis for five loci mapping to 22q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probes to the loci D22S9, D22S43, and ATP6E were present in four copies, whereas D22S57 and D22S181 were present in two copies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding further delineates the distal boundary of the critical region of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>, with ATP6E being the most distal duplicated locus identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> father and grandfather of the patient each had a small supernumerary ring chromosome and demonstrated three copies for the loci D22S9, D22S43, and ATP6E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although three copies of this region have been reported in other cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> features, it is possible that the presence of four copies leads to greater susceptibility </plain></SENT>
