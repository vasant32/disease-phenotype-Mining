<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a case of duplication of the segment 22q11-q12 due to a de novo duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecular cytogenetics studies demonstrated this to be a tandem duplication, flanked proximally by the marker D22Z4, a centromeric alpha satellite DNA repeat, and distally by D22S260, an anonymous DNA marker proximal to the Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> breakpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The segment includes the regions responsible for the "cat-eye," Di George, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">velo-cardio-facial syndromes</z:e> and extends distal to the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture is dominated by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_92'>cardiac defects</z:mpath> and includes findings reminiscent of "cat-eye" syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings reinforce the hypothesis that the proximal 22q region contains dosage-sensitive genes involved in development </plain></SENT>
