<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>cardiovascular malformations</z:hpo> (CVMs) occur in 5-8 per 1000 live births </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) are among the known causes of syndromic CVMs, accounting for an important fraction of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that many additional rare CNVs also cause CVMs and can be detected in patients with CVMs plus extracardiac anomalies (ECAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Through a genome-wide survey of 203 subjects with CVMs and ECAs, we identified 55 CNVs &gt;50â€‰kb in length that were not present in children without known cardiovascular defects (n=872) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen unique CNVs overlapping these variants were found in an independent CVM plus ECA cohort (n=511), which were not observed in 2011 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study identified 12/16 (75%) novel loci including non-recurrent de novo 16q24.3 loss (4/714) and de novo 2q31.3q32.1 loss encompassing PPP1R1C and PDE1A (2/714) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study also narrowed critical intervals in three well-recognized genomic disorders of CVM, such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat-eye syndrome</z:e> region on 22q11.1, 8p23.1 loss encompassing GATA4 and SOX7 and 17p13.3-p13.2 loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An analysis of protein-interaction databases shows that the rare inherited and de novo CNVs detected in the combined cohort are enriched for genes encoding proteins that are direct or indirect partners of proteins known to be required for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cardiac development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings implicate rare variants such as 16q24.3 loss and 2q31.3-q32.1 loss, and delineate regions within previously reported structural variants known to cause CVMs </plain></SENT>
