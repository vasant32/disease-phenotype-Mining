<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe two cases in which a minute supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) was identified in addition to a larger pseudodicentric chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case 1, a phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male, had mosaicism for a psu dic(15;15)(q11.2;q11.2) chromosome and a minute SMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that the minute SMC was D15Z1 positive, indicating a chromosome 15 origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 2 was a 22-week fetus with mosaicism for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and two abnormal cell lines: one had a psu dic (22;22)(q11.2;q11.2) chromosome containing euchromatin, usually associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e>; the other a minute SMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The minute SMC was positive with the D14Z1/D22Z1 alpha-satellite probe, indicating a chromosome 14 or chromosome 22 origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Deletion of centromeric material was proposed as one mechanism of centromere inactivation in dicentric chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The origin of these two minute SMC suggests that they were derived from one of the centromeres of the larger pseudodicentric chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These stable minute SMC may be the by-product of a deletion event inactivating one centromere of a dicentric chromosome to generate a pseudodicentric chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the minute SMC may originate from further rearrangement of the larger pseudodicentric chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cases suggest possible mechanisms for the origin of minute SMC </plain></SENT>
