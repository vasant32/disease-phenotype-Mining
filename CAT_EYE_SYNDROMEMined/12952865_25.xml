<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Low copy repeats (LCRs) located in 22q11.2, especially LCR-B, are susceptible to rearrangements associated with several relatively common constitutional disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These include <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0220704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Velocardiofacial syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat-eye syndrome</z:e> and recurrent translocations of 22q11 including the constitutional t(11;22) and t(17;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of palindromic AT-rich repeats (PATRRs) within LCR-B of 22q11.2, as well as within the 11q23 and 17q11 regions, has suggested a palindrome-mediated, stem-loop mechanism for the generation of such recurring constitutional 22q11.2 translocations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism responsible for non-recurrent 22q11.2 rearrangements is presently unknown due to the extensive effort required for breakpoint cloning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, we have developed a novel fluorescence in-situ hybridization and primed in-situ hybridization (PRINS) approach and rapidly localized the breakpoint of a non-recurrent 22q11.2 translocation, a t(4;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple primer pairs were designed from the sequence of a 200 kb, chromosome 4, breakpoint-spanning BAC to generate PRINS probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Amplification of adjacent primer pairs, labeled in two colors, allowed us to narrow the 4q35.1 breakpoint to a 6.7 kb clonable region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Application of our improved PRINS protocol facilitated fine-mapping the translocation breakpoints within 4q35.1 and 22q11.2, and permitted rapid cloning and analysis of translocation junction fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To confirm the PRINS localization results, PCR mapping of t(4;22) somatic cell hybrid DNA was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the breakpoints demonstrates the presence of a 554 bp palindromic sequence at the chromosome 4 breakpoint and a 22q11.2 location within the same PATRR as the recurrent t(11;22) and t(17;22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sequence of this breakpoint further suggests that a stem-loop secondary structure mechanism is responsible for the formation of other, non-recurrent translocations involving LCR-B of 22q11.2 </plain></SENT>
