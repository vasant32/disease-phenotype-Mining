<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cosmid library was prepared from a radiation hybrid selected for its content in chromosome 22 fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large fraction of cosmids containing human DNA were found to derive from the juxtacentromeric region of chromosome 22, as shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed using individual cosmids or cosmid pools as probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finer mapping was obtained for individual cosmids by hybridization to a somatic cell hybrid mapping panel which splits the long arm of the chromosome into 14 bins numbered 1 to 14 from the centromere to the telomere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 cosmids mapped, eight belonged to group 1, the other two to group 14, in agreement with FISH data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rare endonuclease sites and fragments conserved between species were searched in single cosmids, resulting in the selection of seven cosmid fragments which were used to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three cDNAs were identified, encoded from two chromosome 22 genes which appeared to be novel, as determined from partial end sequence and comparison with the database entries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fine localization of the 30.9 cDNA indicated that the corresponding gene was located in a segment of proximal 22q overlapping with the critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e> region </plain></SENT>
