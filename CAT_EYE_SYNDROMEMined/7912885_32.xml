<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have used dosage and RFLP analyses on 10 CES patients with marker chromosomes, by using probes to five loci mapped to 22q11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sequences recognized by the probes D22S9, D22S43, and D22S57 are in four copies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, but the sequences at the more distal loci, D22S36 and D22S75, are duplicated only in some individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>D22S36 is present in three copies in some individuals, and D22S75 is present in two copies in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only three individuals have a duplication of the most distal locus examined (D22S75), and these individuals have the largest marker chromosomes identified in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the dosage analysis it was found that the marker chromosomes are variable in size and can be asymmetric in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is no obvious correlation between the severity of the phenotype and the size of the duplication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distal boundary of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> critical region (D22S36) is proximal to that of <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp>, a contiguous-gene-deletion syndrome of 22q11.2 </plain></SENT>
