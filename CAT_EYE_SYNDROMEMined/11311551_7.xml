<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its lack determines <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> in mammals, possibly due to accumulation of extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, which induces <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in lymphocytes (Franco et al., 1998) </plain></SENT>
