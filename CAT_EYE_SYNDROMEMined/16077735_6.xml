<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 42 pregnancies with SMC were identified, indicating a prevalence of one in 1032 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 15 SMCs were endowed with detectable euchromatin (prevalence, 1/2884), including six SMCs containing the cat eye critical region (CECR) on chromosome 22q11.21 (1/7212) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>De novo SMCs were found in 29 pregnancies (1/1492), including 14 euchromatic SMCs (48.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies were available for 24 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine pregnancies (37.5%) were terminated; two children (8.3%) were born with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265449" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Pallister-Killian syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome (CES)</z:e>, respectively; 13 children (54.1%) showed apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Familial SMCs were identified in 13 pregnancies (1/3328) from 11 unrelated women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> acrocentric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 10 were heterochromatic and one was an extra der(22)t(11;22) chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 cases were available for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One pregnancy was terminated due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0730379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anhydramnios</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002414'>spina bifida</z:hpo>, and cystic-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000110'>dysplastic kidneys</z:hpo>; one child suffered from a der(22) syndrome; 10 children (83.3%) appeared unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Studies for <z:mp ids='MP_0008867'>uniparental disomy</z:mp> were performed on seven pregnancies and revealed a case of maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>So far this is the largest FISH study of prenatally ascertained SMCs and the first study with detailed data on the prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Findings illustrate the spectrum and clinical outcomes of prenatally diagnosed SMCs, and indicate a higher frequency of SMCs than generally assumed </plain></SENT>
