<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resulting chromosomal abnormalities are involved in Velo-cardio-facial and <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndromes</z:mp> (VCFS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e>) (deletions), "cat eye" syndrome (duplications), and certain types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (translocations) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a prelude to the development of mouse models for VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e> by generating targeted deletions in the mouse genome, we examined the organization of genes from human chromosome 22q11 in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using genetic linkage analysis and detailed physical mapping, we show that genes from a relatively small region of human 22q11 are distributed on three mouse chromosomes (MMU6, MMU10, and MMU16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although the region corresponding to about 2.5 megabases of the VCFS/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DGS</z:e> critical region is located on mouse chromosome 16, the relative organization of the region is quite different from that in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the instability of the 22q11 region is not restricted to humans but may have been present throughout evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results also underscore the importance of detailed comparative mapping of genes in mice and humans as a prerequisite for the development of mouse models of human diseases involving chromosomal rearrangements </plain></SENT>
