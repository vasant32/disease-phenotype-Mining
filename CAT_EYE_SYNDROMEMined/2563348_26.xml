<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used a recombinant phage library enriched for chromosome 22 sequences to isolate and characterize eight anonymous DNA probes detecting restriction fragment length polymorphisms on this autosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were used in conjunction with eight previously reported loci, including the genes BCR, IGLV, and PDGFB, four anonymous DNA markers, and the P1 blood group antigen, to construct a linkage map for chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The linkage group is surprisingly large, spanning 97 cM on the long arm of the chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are no large gaps in the map; the largest intermarker interval is 14 cM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unlike several other chromosomes, little overall difference was observed for sex-specific recombination rates on chromosome 22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The availability of a genetic map will facilitate investigation of chromosome 22 rearrangements in such disorders as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002538'>DiGeorge syndrome</z:mp>, deletions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0009588'>acoustic neuroma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo>, and translocations in Ewing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This defined set of linked markers will also permit testing chromosome 22 for the presence of particular disease genes by family studies and should immediately support more precise mapping and identification of flanking markers for NF2, the defective gene causing bilateral acoustic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
