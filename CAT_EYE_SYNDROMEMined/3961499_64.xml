<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To resolve this question, a single-copy DNA probe, D22S9, was isolated and localized to 22q11 by in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of copies of this sequence was determined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> patients by means of Southern blots and densitometry analysis of autoradiographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with the supernumerary chromosome, four copies were found, whereas in one patient with a duplication of part of chromosome 22, there were three copies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the syndrome results from the presence of either three or four copies of DNA sequences from 22q11; there is no evidence that sequences from other chromosomes are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates how DNA sequence dosage analysis can be used to study <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> that are not readily amenable to standard cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
