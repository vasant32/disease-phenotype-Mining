<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adults with del(22)(q11.2q11.2) may develop psychiatric illnesses, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036337" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">schizoaffective disorder</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007302'>bipolar disorder</z:hpo>, suggesting that lower gene dosage leads to a predisposition to these illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a bid to identify important regulatory polymorphisms (SNPs) that may emulate changes in gene dosage of the genes within the common deletion, we have analyzed the promoter region of 47 genes (44 of which encode a protein with known function) encoding proteins in and around 22q11 for sequence variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 33 of the promoters contained polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of those, 25 were cloned into a reporter gene vector, pGL3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The relative ability of each promoter haplotype to promote transcription of the luciferase gene was tested in each of two human cell lines (HEK293t and TE671), using a cotransfected CMV-SPAP plasmid as an internal control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five genes (PRODH, DGCR14, GSTT2, SERPIND1, and a gene tentatively called DKFZP434P211) showed activity differences between haplotypes of greater than 1.5-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of those, PRODH, which encodes proline dehydrogenase, has previously been highlighted in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo>, and the functional promoter polymorphism reported here may be involved in pathogenic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
