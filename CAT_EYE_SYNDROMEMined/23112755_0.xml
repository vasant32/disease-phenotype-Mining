<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two critical regions for the major clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> (CESCRs) have been suggested; however, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> clinical presentation often does not correlate with the sSMC genetic content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> girl without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>coloboma</z:hpo> and carrier of a de novo type I sSMC(22) as determined by G- and C-banding, NOR staining and microarrays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This sSMC included 6 distal genes outside the original CESCR and led to a tetrasomy for 22q11.1-22q11.21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's final karyotype was 47,XX,+psu dic(22)(q11.21).arr 22q11.1q11.21(15,250,000-17,035,860)Ã—4 dn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The amplified region outside of CESCR included some genes that may be related to neurologic, heart and renal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conversely, even though the amplification included the CECR2 gene, a major candidate for eye features, there was no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>coloboma</z:hpo> in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The genetic delineation of the present sSMC further strengthens that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> clinical presentation does not fit completely with the duplicated genetic content and that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> is actually a genomic disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, since we observed no mosaicism, we believe that other mechanisms might be behind the variability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> phenotypes as well, mainly those related with functional interactions among amplified genes </plain></SENT>
