<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein-protein interaction cloning suggests multisubunit complexes and pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we combine these molecular approaches with cultured cell colocalization analysis to suggest a novel complex and a pathway that integrate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> location and the microtubular cytoskeleton with chromosome remodeling, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression based on a novel leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-motif-containing protein (LRPPRC) that copurified with the fibroblast growth factor receptor complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One round of interaction cloning and sequence homology analysis defined a primary LRPPRC complex with novel subunits <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> chromosome region candidate 2 (CECR2), ubiquitously expressed transcript (UXT), and chromosome 19 open reading frames 5 (C19ORF5) but still of unknown function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immuno, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (DNA), and green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag colocalization analyses revealed that LRPPRC appears in both cytosol and nuclei of cultured cells, colocalizes with mitochondria and beta-tubulin rather than with alpha-actin in the cytosol of interphase cells, and exhibits phase-dependent organization around separating chromosomes in mitotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GFP-tagged CECR2B was strictly nuclear and colocalized with condensed DNA in apoptotic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GFP-tagged UXT and GFP-tagged C19ORF5 appeared in both cytosol and nuclei and colocalized with LRPPRC and beta-tubulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cells exhibiting nuclear C19ORF5 were apoptotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Screening for interactive substrates with the primary LRPPRC substrates in the human liver complementary DNA library revealed that CECR2B interacted with chromatin-associated TFIID-associated protein TAFII30 and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> splicing factor SRP40, UXT bridged to CBP/p300-binding factor CITED2 and kinetochore-associated factor BUB3, and C19ORF5 complexed with mitochondria-associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> dehydrogenase I and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>C19ORF5 also interacted with RASSF1, providing a bridge to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> suppression </plain></SENT>
