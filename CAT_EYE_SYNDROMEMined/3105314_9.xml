<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mother's marker chromosome (mar number 1) is derived from one 22 and another acrocentric, possibly also a 22; the daughter's marker (mar number 2) may be an iso-dicentric, inv-dup (22) derivative of mar number 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mother has a tertiary <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> translocation chromosome composed of at least one and perhaps two copies of 22pter----q11.2, whereas the daughter clearly has a secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 22pter----q11.2 isochromosome, confirming this region as a cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat-eye syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of hybridization using a unique sequence probe localized to 22q11 are consistent with the interpretation that both ends of both marker chromosomes are derived from 22 </plain></SENT>
