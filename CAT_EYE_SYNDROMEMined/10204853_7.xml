<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial karyotype was 46,XX,r(22)(p12q13) [46]/46,XX,dic r(22)(p12q13; p12q13)[4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amount of material duplicated in the dic r(22) was determined to include and extend beyond the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> critical region into 22q13.3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, karyotyping of lymphocytes and fibroblasts, at 27 and 13 months of age respectively, showed no dic r(22) present in any of the cells examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> features in this patient, and potentially in other ring cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> phenotypic features, might result from a high level of mosaicism for a dic r(22) during early fetal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Usually this unstable dic r(22) is subsequently lost from most cells </plain></SENT>
