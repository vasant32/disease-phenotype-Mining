<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They both presented a constellation of features typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>coloboma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000377'>auricular malformations</z:hpo>, heart and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000077'>renal anomalies</z:hpo>, as well as hepatic dysfunction, which led to severe effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one case <z:hpo ids='HP_0000201'>Pierre Robin sequence</z:hpo> was diagnosed which has not been described earlier in this <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> is a well known, but infrequently diagnosed disorder, we draw attention both to its clinical overlaps with other disorders and, in view of the clinical variability being identified within the 22q11 region, to the importance of careful molecular examination of proximal 22q in patients with suggestive clinical signs </plain></SENT>
