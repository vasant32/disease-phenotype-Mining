<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two distinct deletions, one on each chromosome 22, were identified, presumably arising from independent somatic recombination events occurring during B-lymphocyte differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent of the deleted regions was determined using probes from the various IGLV subgroups and they each cover at least 82 kilobases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The precise definition of the deletions was not possible because of conservation of some restriction sites in the IGLV region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cell line was used to map putative IGLV genes within the recombinant phage lambda V lambda 135 to the distal part of the IGLV gene region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the deletions are relatively small, the cell line will be valuable for mapping IGLV genes in the distal part of this region </plain></SENT>
