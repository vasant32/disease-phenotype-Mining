<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present 50 probands with ESACs characterized by fluorescence in situ hybridization using centromere-specific probes and chromosome-specific libraries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ESAC-specific libraries were constructed by flow sorting and subsequent amplification by DOP-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using such ESAC-specific libraries we were able to outline the chromosome regions involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of the 50 ESACs were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0795854" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inverted duplications of chromosome 15</z:e> [inv dup(15)], including patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002873'>normal phenotypes</z:mp> and others with similar clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 2 groups differed in size and shape of the inv dup(15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a large inv dup(15), which included the Prader-Willi region, had a high risk of abnormality, whereas patients with a small inv dup(15), not including the Prader-Willi region, were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ESACs derived from chromosomes 13 or 21 appeared to have a low risk of abnormality, while one out of 3 patients with an ESAC derived from chromosome 14 had discrete symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One out of 3 patients with an ESAC derived from chromosome 22 had severe anomalies, corresponding to some of the manifestations of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Small extra ring chromosomes of autosomal origin and ESACs identified as i(12p) or i(18p) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated with a high risk of abnormality </plain></SENT>
