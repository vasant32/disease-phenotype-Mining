<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, molecular cytogenetic methods of chromosome analysis enable precise characterization of such abnormalities providing knowledge necessary for estimation of their genetic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: The aim of the study was molecular cytogenetic characterization of marker chromosomes recognized in three patients, an analysis of clinical features in relation to the abnormality and estimation of genetic risk of identified markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Karyotypes of three phenotypically abnormal patients were estimated in lymphocytes from peripheral blood by G banding analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marker chromosomes were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), multiplex FISH, multicolor band and high resolution comparative genomic hybridization methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marker chromosomes were identified as inv dup(22)(pter-&gt;q11.2::q11.2-&gt;pter), der(8)(:p22-&gt;q11.2:), der(2l)(:pter-&gt;q21.3:) and der(19)(:p11-&gt;q13.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them contained euchromatic sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>First marker, an inverted duplication of chromosome 22q11.2 corresponding to tetrasomy of this chromosome region was recognized in a child with partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two further markers derived from chromosomes 8 and 21 were found in a child with mosaic karyotype and clinical features of <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the third case additional chromosome material was derived from chromosome 19 and it was found in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001256'>mild mental retardation</z:hpo> and clinical features of ovary dysgenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Genetic risk of identified marker chromosomes except for mar(19) was estimated as high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide further evidence for diagnostic value of molecular cytogenetic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They also confirmed the general opinion of the high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000118'>phenotypic abnormalities</z:hpo> in the carriers of marker chromosomes containing euchromatic sequences </plain></SENT>
