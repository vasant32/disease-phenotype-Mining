<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with the so-called <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat Eye syndrome</z:e> are reported including a more detailed description of the original cases reported by Schmid and Fraccaro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases had, in addition to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype, a small extra G-like chromosome which appeared to be an isochromosome for the juxtacentromeric region (pter to q11) of an acrocentric chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None were mosaics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings and further cytogenetic studies in a few cases suggest that these markers probably derive from a No. 22 chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Characteristic features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat Eye syndrome</z:e> in these 11 patients and those reviewed from the literature are: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>ocular coloboma</z:hpo> which may involve the iris, choroid and/or optic nerve, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000384'>preauricular skin tags</z:hpo> and/or pits which are probably the most consistent feature, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart defect</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002023'>anal atresia</z:hpo> with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000792'>renal malformations</z:hpo> such as unilateral absence, unilateral or bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, and cystic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, and antimongoloid position of eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intelligence is usually low-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, although moderate retardation is also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is great variability in the clinical findings ranging from near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to lethal malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Less frequent, but also characteristic findings are: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000568'>microphthalmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0008551'>microtia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000413'>atresia of the external auditory canal</z:hpo>, intrahepatic or extrahepatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005912'>biliary atresia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002566'>malrotation</z:hpo> of the gut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Direct transmission of the marker from one generation to the other was observed in both sexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In those families, there was considerable variability in the clinical findings between affected family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These cases show that there is a bias of ascertainment for patients who have the more striking malformations, especially those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>ocular coloboma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002023'>anal atresia</z:hpo>, a combination which appears to be present in only a minority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Many mildly affected patients probably remain undetected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that the term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat Eye syndrome</z:e> should be applied only to cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> or tetrasomy of not more than 22pter to q11 and without additional duplication or deletion of another autosomal segment </plain></SENT>
