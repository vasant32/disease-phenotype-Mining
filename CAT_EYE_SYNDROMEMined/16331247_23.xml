<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A recent study revealed that the p110alpha (PIK3CA), catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), is somatically mutated in many types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For example, PIK3CA is mutated in an estimated 35.6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To measure the frequency of PIK3CA hotspot mutations in Japanese <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> patients, exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene were sequenced in 47 clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrary to expectations, no hotspot mutations were found any of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we found abnormally migrating waves near the end of exon 9 in the PCR chromatograms from 13 of the 47 samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PCR amplification and subsequent cloning and sequencing revealed that these chromatograms contained two distinct sequences, the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> p110alpha sequence and a different sequence found on human chromosome 22q11.2, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat Eye Syndrome</z:e> region, which contains a putative pseudogene of PIK3CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These abnormally migrating waves were also found in noncancerous liver tissue, indicating that this was not a result of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>-associated mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely that the percentage of hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene of Japanese <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> patients is lower than was previously reported </plain></SENT>
