<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have sequenced a 1.1-Mb region of human chromosome 22q containing the dosage-sensitive gene(s) responsible for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome (CES)</z:e> as well as the 450-kb homologous region on mouse chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen putative genes were identified within or adjacent to the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> critical region (CESCR), including three known genes (IL-17R, ATP6E, and BID) and nine novel genes, based on EST identity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two putative genes (CECR3 and CECR9) were identified, in the absence of EST hits, by comparing segments of human and mouse genomic sequence around two solitary amplified exons, thus showing the utility of comparative genomic sequence analysis in identifying transcripts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 genes, 10 were confirmed to be present in the mouse genomic sequence in the same order and orientation as in human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absent from the mouse region of conserved synteny are CECR1, a promising <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> candidate gene from the center of the contig, neighboring CECR4, and CECR7 and CECR8, which are located in the gene-poor proximal 400 kb of the contig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This latter proximal region, located approximately 1 Mb from the centromere, shows abundant duplicated gene fragments typical of pericentromeric DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The margin of this region also delineates the boundary of conserved synteny between the CESCR and mouse chromosome 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the proximal CESCR appears abundant in duplicated segments and, therefore, is likely to be gene poor, we consider the putative genes identified in the distal CESCR to represent the majority of candidate genes for involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> </plain></SENT>
