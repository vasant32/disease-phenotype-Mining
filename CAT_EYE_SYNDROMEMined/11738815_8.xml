<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A novel family of growth factors, with sequence similarity to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase, has been identified in various organisms including flesh fly, tsetse fly, sand fly, mollusk and human </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The human homologue, CECR1, is a candidate gene for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">cat eye syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe six members of this growth factor family in Drosophila and two in vertebrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The six Drosophila genes, named <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase-related growth factors (ADGF), are found at three different chromosomal locations, with one singleton, two in an inverted orientation, and three in a tandem arrangement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These genes show distinct patterns of expression as measured by RT-PCR and Northern blots, indicating gene-specific function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of six ADGF genes in the Drosophila genome suggests that gene duplication and divergence has been important for these growth factors in insect development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic analysis of the 14 extant ADGF-like gene products shows there are at least three major groups, two of which are found in Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third appears specific to the vertebrate line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven gene duplications are inferred among the ADGF-like genes, most of which occurred long before the origin of Drosophila </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our analysis predicts the existence of several other unsampled ADGF-like genes, both within the species examined here, and in other related invertebrates </plain></SENT>
