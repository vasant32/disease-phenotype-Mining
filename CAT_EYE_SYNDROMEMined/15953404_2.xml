<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 19-year-old man with craniofacial dysmorphic features, anorectal malformations, eye <z:hpo ids='HP_0000589'>colobomas</z:hpo>, orthopaedic anomalies, and mild neurodevelopmental delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CES">Cat eye syndrome (CES)</z:e> was suspected, and confirmed by cytogenetic analysis which showed the presence of a supernumerary bisatellited chromosome, identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as invdup(22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The marker was further analyzed with six BAC clones located at the 22q11.1 and 22q11.2 regions; this analysis allowed correct assignment at low copy repeat 4 on chromosome 22 (LCR22-4) of the two breakpoints, confirming the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> chromosome type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's phenotype is considered in the light of the cytogenetic, and FISH investigations results and other patients reported in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular definition of the breakpoints at the LCR22-4 copy confirms the role of different chromosome 22-specific LCRs in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> chromosomes generation, as well as in other chromosome 22 germ line rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our report confirms that, unlike other conditions, i.e. the invdup(15) bisatellited dicentric marker, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e> phenotype does not appear to correlate with the size of the marker chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional cases are necessary to be able to draw more specific genotype-phenotype correlations and to determine the outcome of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>, especially when this rare condition is diagnosed in prenatal age </plain></SENT>
