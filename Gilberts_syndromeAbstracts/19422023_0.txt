Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), a X-linked hereditary deficiency, is one of most common clinically significant enzyme defects. Despite its largely known role in acute and life-threatening haemolytic crises, G6PD deficiency may be also associated with neonatal jaundice that, when severe and untreated, may lead to the potential of bilirubin encephalopathy. A prolonged neonatal jaundice was found to be associated with a rare G6PD mutation (c.383T>G; p.L128R), the latter simply annotated in literature database. In this article, we clinically and phenotipically describe a case of an Italian neonate carrying the c.383T>G G6PD mutation. Finally, we named this variant "G6PD Salerno."
