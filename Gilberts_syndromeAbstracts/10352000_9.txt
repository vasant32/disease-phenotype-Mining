Gilbert syndrome, a benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinemiawithout structural liver disease or overt hemolysis, is characterizedby episodes of mild intermittent jaundice (1)(2)(3). Gilbertsyndrome is the most common inherited variant of hepatic bilirubinmetabolism, occurring in 2&#150;12% of the population, and it is oftendetected in adulthood during routine blood tests. The most consistentfeature in Gilbert syndrome is a deficiency in bilirubinglucuronidation, but the metabolism of drugs may also be affected(3).
