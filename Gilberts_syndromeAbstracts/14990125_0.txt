OBJECTIVE: To compare the pass rate of auto-auditory brainstem response (AABR) in infants complicated with different high-risk factors. METHODS: 245 infants (488 ears) with different high-risk factors, including premature, low-weight, hyperbilirubinemia, asphyxiation and pulmonary diseases, were tested by transiently evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) and AABR at the same time. RESULTS: The pass rate of AABR and that of TEOAE were different for the infants with different high-risk factors. The number that passed TEOAE test and referred to AABR test: premature 15 ears, low-weight 3 ears, for hyperbilirubinemia 1 ears, for asphyxiation 5 ears, and for pulmonary diseases 35ears. The pass rate of AABR was reduced evidently when infants had pulmonary diseases and the complicated high-risk factors (chi(2) = 35.723, P < 0.01). Different high-risk factors produced different pass rates of AABR (chi(2) = 40.556, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: High-risk factors effect the auditory function. The pass rate of AABR is reduced evidently when an infant has both pulmonary diseases and the complicated high-risk factors. We should pay attention to these infants in universal newborn hearing screening.
