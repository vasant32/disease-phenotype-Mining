The total activity of lactatedehydrogenase (Merck tests) and its isoenzymes (electrophoretic fractionation by Helm) were studied in the blood sera of 202 patients with various hepato-biliary diseases (viral hepatitis, chronic persisting and chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis of liver, chronic cholecystitis, benign cholestasis, malignant formations with and without cholestasis, Gilbert's syndrome and hemolytic jaundice). The referent limits are determined in the sera of 43 clinically healthy subjects (22 females and 21 males). The anaerobic fifth fraction of lactatedehydrogenase (LDH) was most increased in viral hepatitis (about 15 times), in the group with malignant formations with cholestasis (about 2 times) and in benign cholestasis (about 5 times). The determination of isoenzymes of LDH, is presumed, to be obligatorily included in the spectrum of modern enzyme constellation for hepatobiliary diseases.
