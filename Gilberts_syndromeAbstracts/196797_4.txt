With the development of simplified methods of bile acid analysis, a new era has drawned in the evaluation of hepatobiliary disease. 1. A total serum bile acid particularly in the postprandial periods is more sensitive than either BSP or ICG for the detection of minimal liver disease and will become a useful screening method. 2. The ratio of chenodeoxycholate to cholate in serum together with the total concentration can often distinguish hepatitis and cirrhosis from intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis with normal liver cell parenchyma. However, in practice this is usually of less value than the total serum bile acid level. 3. Changes in serum bile acids throughout a 24 hour cycle reflect the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and the capacity of the liver to transport them. These patterns are most useful in judging the severity of cholestasis and response to resin therapy. They also provide new insights into the pathophysiology of bile acid metabolism and excretion in different diseases of the liver.
