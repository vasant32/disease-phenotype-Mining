BACKGROUND: Gilbert syndrome as a rule becomes manifest in adolescence or in early adulthood; it may be transferred by the donor to orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients. METHODS: We examined the frequency of Gilbert syndrome in 46 OLT pediatric recipients who had a follow-up of 1 year or more. Diagnostic criteria included unexplained chronic or recurrent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia; its increase after reduced caloric intake plus prolonged fasting, without changes of the proportion of conjugated bilirubin; and high relative amounts of serum unconjugated bilirubin IXa and prevalence of the monoglucuronide over the diglucuronide. RESULTS: Of the 46 patients, 42 had normal bilirubin values. Only four otherwise healthy OLT recipients showed hyperbilirubinemia and normal conjugated fractions. Liver donors had been four men. Hyperbilirubinemia persisted with a fluctuating pattern for the whole follow-up after OLT in all. Total bilirubin level in blood samples obtained after reduced caloric intake and prolonged fasting became notably higher than basal values, whereas the proportion of conjugated bilirubin remained stable. High relative amounts of unconjugated bilirubin IXa and prevalence of the monoglucuronide over the diglucuronide were found. Finally, DNA from liver donors' lymphocytes was available for one jaundiced and two nonjaundiced patients: tests for abnormalities in the promoter region of the gene for the enzyme bilirubin uridine diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase were in agreement with a diagnosis of GS in the former one, CONCLUSIONS: Gilbert syndrome may have an unusual early presentation in pediatric OLT recipients.
