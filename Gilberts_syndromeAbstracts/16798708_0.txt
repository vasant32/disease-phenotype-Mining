We describe 4 jaundiced neonates with acute pyelonephritis of whom family history was positive for or pointed to Gilbert's syndrome (GS). Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT-1A1), (TA)7 polymorphism, associated with GS was found in these neonates. We suggest that extended (TA)7 promoter, acting as a predisposing factor, contributes substantially to hyperbilirubinaemia seen in a number of neonates with urinary tract infections (UTIs).
