The frequency of the (TA)7/(TA)7 promoter genotype of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1) was significantly higher (p<0.05) in a group of 30 children with cholelithiasis than in a control group of 40 healthy children, indicating that this genotype might be an underlying factor for gallstone initiation in otherwise healthy children.
