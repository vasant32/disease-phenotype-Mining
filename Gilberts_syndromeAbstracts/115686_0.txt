The activity of bilirubin UDP-xylosyl transferase as well as UDP-glucuronyl transferase in liver biopsy specimens of 3 control subjects, 42 cases with liver disease and 5 cases with Gilbert's syndrome was measured. Normal values of these enzyme levels were determined to be 142--302 U/kg protein for the former and 260--400 U/kg protein for the latter. Both enzyme levels in acute hepatitis in convalescence and chronic hepatitis were nearly in the normal range. In the cirrhotic liver they tended to a small decrease and patients with Gilbert's syndrome demonstrated significantly decreased enzyme levels. These enzyme levels were only correlated with serum unconjugated bilirubin concentration, but not with the other liver function tests. Finally, both enzyme activities were exactly correlated with each other.
