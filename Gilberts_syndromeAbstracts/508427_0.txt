We have studied plasmatic half-life of R-SV administered alone and in association with nicotinic acid, before and after treatment with phenobarbital, in 10 normobilirubinaemic subjects and in 10 patients Gilbert's syndrome, used like controls. Ouer results confirm the existence of some alterations of drug-metabolism produced by associated administration of other drugs, in both healthy and hyperbilirubinaemic subjects, and in these one even more.
