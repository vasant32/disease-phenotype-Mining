The concentrations of bile acids in serum determined by a relatively simple enzymatic method ranged between 1.6 and 9.2 mumol/l in 60 normal volunteers and between 2.1 and 7.7. mumol/l in 14 patients with Gilbert's syndrome. In contrast, 48 patients with various liver diseases had - with 2 exceptions - markedly elevated serum bile acids (up to 140 mumol/l). Together with BSP retention, BSP disappearance and SGOT, the bile acid level in serum represented one of the most sensitive indices for detection of liver disease. The sensitivity of this test can be further increased by bile acid determination 2 h after a meal. Since this test is both simple and harmless its broader clinical use appears attractive.
