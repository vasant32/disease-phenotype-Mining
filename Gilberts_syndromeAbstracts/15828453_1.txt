The patient was an elderly male who had radical surgery for sigmoid cancer in 2001. Owing to metastasis of his cancer to the left supraclavicular lymph nodes in 2002, the patient was admitted to our hospital for systemic chemotherapy. We started treatment with irinotecan, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (IFL). After administering 100 mg/m2 of irinotecan, 250 mg/m2 leucovorin and 600 mg/m2 5-fluorouracil to the patient on day 1, grade 3 leukopenia developed rapidly and grade 4 thrombocytopenia was observed on day 5. We excluded irinotecan from the medication and continued the administration of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin, but his tumors had not been reduced sufficiently. Based on some examination results, we assumed that the patient had Gilbert's syndrome and that the severe side effects that occurred were due to prolongation of SN38 metabolism. We again administered irinotecan but at reduced dose (25 mg/m2). Four courses of this modified IFL were administered safely and the response was favorable.
