Forty-eight adult patients with celiac disease between 15 and 68 years of age (mean, 41 years) were studied. Sixty-seven percent were female and 33% were male patients. Most of the patients were white (98%). The main clinical features were diarrhea (90%), weight loss (70%), and abdominal pain (56%). On physical examination, the main findings were pallor (40%), aphthous stomatitis (31%), and arthralgia (23%). Associated disorders included diabetes mellitus type I, osteoporosis, and atopy (6% each); dermatitis herpetiformis and depression (4% each); and hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, duodenal carcinoma, and Gilbert syndrome (2% each). The histologic results according to Marsh criteria (modified by Rostami) are as follows: type I, 10%; type II, 21%; type IIIa, 19%; type IIIb, 17%; and type IIIc, 33%. The sensitivity and specificity for the antiendomysium antibody-immunoglobulin A test were 92% and 100%, respectively, when considering the whole group of patients; however, the sensitivity (but not the specificity) decreased to 86% when taking into account only the group of patients with mild histologic alterations (Marsh type I, II, and IIIa).CONCLUSION: In general, the authors' results are similar to those described in developing countries, indicating that celiac disease might have the same spectrum of presentation regardless of the region studied.
