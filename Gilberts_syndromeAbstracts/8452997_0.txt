OBJECTIVE: To show the effectiveness and feasibility of the Rifampicin test in diagnosing Gilbert's syndrome. DESIGN: A prospective, descriptive study. SITE. General Medical Service of the Navarra Hospital. PATIENTS: 17 patients with bilirubin levels on two or more occasions and 6 healthy patients without these data. Both in- and out-patients. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The Rifampicin test. Bilirubin levels were determined when fasting and one, two, three and four hours after taking 900 mg of Rifampicin (Rimactan). After the test, those patients who had Gilbert's disease presented bilirubin levels significantly higher than the healthy patients, who remained within normal levels. CONCLUSIONS: In the group studied, the Rifampicin test demonstrated its effectiveness in the diagnosis of suspected Gilbert's disease. It would therefore be possible to use this test in the Primary Care field.
