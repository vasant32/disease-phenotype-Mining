We report a case of Gilbert syndrome caused by a homozygous missense mutation (Tyr486Asp) of the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene. Homozygous missense mutations of the gene have previously been recognized as responsible for Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. We conclude that Gilbert syndrome in some patients results from homozygous missense mutations of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene.
