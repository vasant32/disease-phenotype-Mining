This article describes a 29-year-old man with a 21-year history of undiagnosed jaundice. The major abnormality in this patient was unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. All other liver function tests were normal. The apparent cause of his condition was elucidated, and the hyperbilirubinemia disappeared after he was treated with phenobarbitone. A review of the literature indicates that this is the first documented case of this syndrome in the English-speaking Caribbean.
