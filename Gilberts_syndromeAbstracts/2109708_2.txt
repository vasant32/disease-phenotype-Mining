1. Bolivian squirrel monkeys (BoSMs), which are animal models for Gilbert's syndrome, have 40% less hepatic bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase (BR-UPPG-T) activity than Brazilian squirrel monkeys (BrSMs). 2. Although fasting results in similar decreases in hepatic UDP-glucose and UDP-glucuronate levels in both simian subspecies, increased activities (55%) of BR-UDPG-T are induced only in the fasted control BrSMs, which do not exhibit the marked fasting hyperbilirubinemia (FH). 3. Total hepatic bilirubin (BR) concentrations were 50% greater in both fed and fasted BoSMs when compared to BrSMs. 4. Hepatic unconjugated BR levels increase upon fasting only in Gilbert-like BoSMs, reaching concentrations twice that observed in BrSMs. 5. Elevated hepatic BR levels in fasted BoSMs may reflect BR overproduction or inadequate glucuronidation. 6. The increased BR-UDPG-T activity induced in BrSMs during fasting could compensate in-part for the UDPGA depletion and prevent the marked FH as observed in BoSMs.
