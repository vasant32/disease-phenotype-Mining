Hyperbilirubinemia may be of several etiologies in the individual patient. An 18-year-old man presented with extreme hyperbilirubinemia (direct bilirubin 23.0 mg/dl, total bilirubin 60.0 mg/dl), hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. Hematologic studies prelaparotomy documented the presence of hereditary spherocytosis. Intraoperative liver biopsy revealed moderately reduced levels of glucuronyl transferase activity (Gilbert's syndrome). Common bile duct obstruction secondary to choledocholithiasis was found, and a cholecystectomy and splenectomy were performed. This case stresses the potential confusion among several diseases which may present with hyperbilirubinemia.
