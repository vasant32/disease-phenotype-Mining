 OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of hyperbilirubinemia on lower urinary tract function. METHODS: The study was conducted on 29 patients with suspected Gilbert's syndrome (GS), and who were subjected to fasting test for diagnostic purpose. The uroflowmetric test was performed after 24 h of fasting and after 24 h of hypercaloric intake. RESULTS: After a 24 h fasting period, when bilirubin in the serum was at its highest concentration, 31% of patients had abnormal uroflowmetric patterns. Patients with abnormal uroflowmetric patterns had higher conjugated bilirubin after 24 h fasting period than patients with normal pattern (p = 0.012). After a 24 h of hypercaloric intake, all 29 patients had a normal (bell-shaped) uroflowmetric pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The results imply that hyperbilirubinemia might be a predisposing factor for intermittent lower urinary tract dysfunction in children.
