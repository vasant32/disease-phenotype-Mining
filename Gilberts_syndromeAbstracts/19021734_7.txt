OBJECTIVES: Aim of this study was to evaluate prevalence and characteristics of cholelithiasis in a large population of patients with thalassemia major (TM). METHODS: Data from 858 consecutive patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia at five major Italian centers were analyzed. In these centers, a complete abdomen ultrasonography is performed yearly after the beginning of the transfusion regimen. The role of co-inheriting Gilbert's syndrome genotype was investigated studying the promoter region of the UGT1-A1 gene by automated sequencing. RESULTS: Thirty percent of TM patients had gallstones. The Gilbert's genotype [homozygosity for (TA)(7) motif at UGT1A promoter gene], influenced both the prevalence of cholelithiasis and the age at which it developed. CONCLUSIONS: Cholelithiasis has a remarkable frequency and precocity in patients with TM and especially in those with (TA)(7)/(TA)(7) UGT1-A1 genotype. An early biliary ultrasonography is recommended from childhood and a closer follow-up in patients with thalassemia and associated Gilbert's syndrome may be indicated.
