I would like to comment on the article by Djouss&#xe9; and colleagues, who showed low cardiovascular risk in hyperbilirubinemic men but not in women. These data are interesting, in particular, with regard to the results of our study on the same topic presented at the 5th International Conference on Preventive Cardiology in May 2001. The design of our study was quite different; the study population included only subjects with benign hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert syndrome) who had been followed prospectively for 3 years. Our conclusions were similar in that the significantly decreased incidence of ischemic heart disease was observed in hyperbilirubinemic subjects compared with the general population. Although the sample size was not very large, and the length of follow-up was just 3 years, the differences between the incidence rates in hyperbilirubinemic patients and the normal population were prominent and reached statistical significance. According to the analysis of risk factors, we found an independent protective effect of bilirubin on the prevention of ischemic heart disease, which is consistent with data published recently.  Moreover, we demonstrated an increase in the total antioxidant capacity in subjects with Gilbert syndrome, presumably due to high bilirubin levels as proved in an in vitro experiment. Complete results of our study have just been accepted for publication in Atherosclerosis.
