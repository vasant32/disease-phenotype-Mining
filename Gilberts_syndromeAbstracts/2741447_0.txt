Zixoryn (Flumezinolum) is a new enzyme inductor without the adverse effects of the other known substances with similar inductor activity (phenobarbitals, DDT derivates, etc.). It was applied to 12 patients with unconjugated nonhemolytic familial jaundice--Gilbert-Meulengracht's syndrome. The dose was 600 mg'6 capsules of 100 mg taken as a single dose) once in a week in the course of 2 months. This treatment led to a 50% reduction of the hyperbilirubinemia in all patients treated. In the patients with initial bilirubin level under 35 mmol/l Zixoryn led to normalization of the bilirubin level with a normal ratio between the conjugated and unconjugated fractions. The discontinuance of Zixoryn treatment led in the course of 20-25 days to a gradual rise of bilirubin to its previous pathologic level. No side effects were registered in the patients treated with Zixoryn. Zixoryn is a new effecient drug for treatment through enzyme induction of bilirubin transport and glucuronizing enzyme systems in the hepatocytes. It is especially useful, in patients with high unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia as well as in patients with deterioration of the disease with an increase of the bilirubin level--total and unconjugated.
