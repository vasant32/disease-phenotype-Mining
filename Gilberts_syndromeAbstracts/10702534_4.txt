For detection of nucleotide polymorphisms or microinsertions/deletions, an optimal genotyping method would be rapid and economical. Newer, homogeneous, and automated genotyping methods with fluorescent oligonucleotide probes (1)(2)(3) can be expensive, and their use is difficult to optimize. Here we demonstrate the application of melting temperature (Tm) analysis (4) in a study of the UGT1A gene in a family with Gilbert syndrome.
