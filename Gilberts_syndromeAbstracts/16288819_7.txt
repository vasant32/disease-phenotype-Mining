We report two patients with uncommon Gilbert's syndrome with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia which was reduced from 200 to 60-90 micromol/L by long-term administration of rifampicin. Hepatic induction of bilirubin-glucuronosyltransferase was suggested by increased relative amounts of conjugated serum bilirubin. This molecular mechanism was confirmed in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.
