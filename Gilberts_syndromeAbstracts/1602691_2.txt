We report a rare case of atrial septal defect (ASD) with Gilbert's syndrome. The patient was a 34-year-old man, who underwent successfully patch closure for ASD, and annuloplasty for tricuspid valve regurgitation by DeVega's method. Gilbert's syndrome is a disorder characterised by a unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without other hepatic dysfunction. In our case, there was no evidence of hepatic damage related to hyperbilirubinemia postoperatively. Open heart surgery for patient with Gilbert's syndrome is supposed to be performed rather safely.
