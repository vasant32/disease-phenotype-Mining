Eleven patients with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (Gilbert's syndrome) took part in a double-blind cross-over trial of phenobarbitone and phetharbital, a non-hypnotic barbiturate. Significant reductions in plasma bilirubin were observed with both drugs, but six patients complained of sleepiness on phenobarbitone, and phetharbital was preferred by most patients. Phetharbital was also effective in the rare severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia of the Crigler-Najjar syndrome (Type 2). Symptoms attributed to Gilbert's syndrome, including nausea and abdominal pain, were less consistently relieved.
