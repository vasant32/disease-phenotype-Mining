Of 1,756 liver biopsies performed in the years 1987-1991, in 139 cases the patients exhibited both a nearly normal liver histology and elevated GGT values. After exclusion of patients with known causes for an elevated GGT 15 patients were selected, who over at least one year, were documented as having at least 3 measured GGT values with an average of over 40 U/l. In the follow-up of 1-15 years a typical constellation was detectable: longterm elevation of GGT (average 47-156 U/l, moreover a smaller degree of elevation of GLDH and GPT), minimal deviations from norm in liver histology (periportal fibrosis and/or fatty liver degeneration), and functional abdominal complaints. This triad occurred predominantly in middle-aged males, did not exhibit laboratory-chemical or histological signs of progression or regression tendencies and could be interpreted as a "functional" liver disorder with parelleles to M. Gilbert-Meulengracht.
