Data are submitted from long-term follow-ups over 78 patients with Gilbert-Meylengraht's syndrome (71 men and 7 women). The above syndrome was identifiable predominantly in those persons aged 15-30. A major proportion of the patients (75%) displayed different dyspeptic phenomena and asthenovegetative disturbances, 25% had no complaints. The principle diagnostic criterion for the syndrome is predominant or solitary elevation of blood serum levels of free (unconjugated, indirect) bilirubin without signs of affection liver, obturation of the biliary tract, and enhanced hemolysis. This form hyper bilirubinemia runs benign course. All above patients remain able bodied having enough capacity for work. In exacerbations, it is helpful to prescribe small doses of phenobarbital (0.05-0.15 gr daily), under the influence of which drug the serum level of bilirubin returns to normal, this effect lasting only for a period of the drug administration.
