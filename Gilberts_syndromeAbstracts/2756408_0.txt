We present 2 patients with carotenemia who also suffered from iron deficiency anemia. A causal relationship between the ingestion of excessive quantities of carrots and iron deficiency is postulated, since iron deficiency is known to be responsible for change of appetite (pica). A knowledge of this condition, which follows an indolent, reversible course, is necessary for the clinician mainly in view of the differential diagnostic aspects.
