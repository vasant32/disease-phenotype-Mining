AIM: To research the behaviour of one biliary acid (glyco-cholic) i.v. injected in patients with Gilbert's disease and in healthy controls, so that contribute to the knowledge of the pathophysiological correlate between bilirubin and biliary acids. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We include 15 patients with Gilbert's disease and 7 healthy voluntary ones. We injected i.v. glycocholic acid and obtained the clearance curve (CG-RIA Abbot method). We evaluated the possible biostatistically significant differences between the obtained values of both groups though the non-parametric method of Mann-Whitney. RESULTS: The clearance curve of both groups had a similar profile; biostatisticaly there are not significant differences between the serum values of glyco-cholic acid in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The clearance of the glyco-cholic acid in patients with Gilbert's disease had a similar behaviour as in healthy controls, without biostatisticaly significant differences between both groups.
