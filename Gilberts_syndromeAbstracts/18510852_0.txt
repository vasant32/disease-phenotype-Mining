OBJECTIVE: To summarize the clinical and pathological features of Gilbert syndrome. METHODS: The clinical features and liver histological findings of 16 cases of Gilbert syndrome were reviewed. RESULTS: Of the 16 cases (13 males and 3 females, with an age range from 14 to 40 years), all had recurrent jaundice, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and lipofuscin granules in the hepatocytes around the hepatic perivenular areas. The genetic analysis of the two patients showed that the site of genetic mutations were located at exon 1 (Gly71Arg). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of Gilbert disease can be improved by combining the data of clinical features, the genetic analysis findings and the histological changes of the livers of the patients.
