The combined metabolic stresses of fasting and the intravenous injection of 50 mg nicotinic acid in Friedreich's ataxia resulted in the delineation of two sub-groups of responses. High bilirubin ataxics maintained abnormally elevated levels of bilirubin, while normal bilirubin ataxics behaved like the normal control group. It is postulated that this finding infers the possible linkage of the gene for Friedreich's ataxia and that for Gilbert's disease.
