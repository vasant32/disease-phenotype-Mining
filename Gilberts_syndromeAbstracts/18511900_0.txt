Gilbert's syndrome is a genetically controlled non-hemolytic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, caused by reduced activity of UDP-glucoroniltransferase 1, an enzyme critical in bilirubin metabolism. Several molecular configurations may be implicated in a Gilbert's phenotype. Familial mediterranean fever (FMF) is an inherited acute relapsing inflammatory disorder, affecting Mediterranean and Middle East populations. The molecular basis of the disorder concerns the MEFV gene coding for a protein named pyrin; several point mutations of MEFV gene have been associated with the disease. The authors present an unusual patient co-affected by both Gilbert's syndrome and FMF who carried a peculiar Gilbert's genotype. The coexistence of these two genetic conditions seems to be rare but interesting as the potentially overlapping clinical symptoms may rise interesting diagnostic problems.
