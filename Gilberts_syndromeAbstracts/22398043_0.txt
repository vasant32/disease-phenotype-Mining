 BACKGROUND: An imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their capturing by antioxidants results in oxidative stress, this may play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since bilirubin is an important endogenous antioxidant, increased levels of bilirubin may protect against IBD. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) is the only enzyme involved in the conjugation of bilirubin and the common UGT1A1*28 allele in the UGT1A1 gene, which is strongly associated with Gilbert's syndrome in Caucasians, results in elevated plasma bilirubin levels. AIMS: To test the hypothesis that the UGT1A1*28 allele is associated with lower disease susceptibility to, and disease behavior within, IBD. In addition, a possible altered risk for developing IBD-drug related side-effects was explored. METHODOLOGY: Genomic DNA of 751 patients with IBD (209 patients with ulcerative colitis and 542 patients with Crohn's disease) and 930 healthy controls was genotyped for the UGT1A1*28 promoter polymorphism, and genotype distribution was compared between patients and controls. Genotype phenotype interactions were also investigated. RESULTS: Patients with Crohn's disease significantly less often bear the UGT1A1*28 homozygous genotype compared to the control group, with an odds ratio of 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.98. The ulcerative colitis group showed no significant differences compared to controls. CONCLUSION: The homozygous state of the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism, associated with higher serum bilirubin levels, may be protective for the development of Crohn's disease, suggesting that the anti-oxidant capacity of bilirubin may play a part.
