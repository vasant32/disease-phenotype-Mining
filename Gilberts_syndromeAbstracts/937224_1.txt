Patients with Gilbert's syndrome were placed on low calorie diets and isocaloric diets sequentially severely reduced in carbohydrate, protein, or fat content. Significant increases in the serum bilirubin concentration occurred after the low calorie diet, but not after the isocaloric nutrient-depleted diets. Thus caloric deprivation per se and not changes in dietary components is responsible for diet-induced hyperbilirubinemia.
