OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to study the diagnostic value of the measurement of total serum bile acids in patients with Gilbert's syndrome as compared to the fasting test. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have studied 17 patients, 12 males and 5 females, between the ages of 7 and 15 years. All patients showed a slight unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (1.4 +/- 0.5 mg/dl) in the presence of repeated normal liver function test, including the total serum bile acids (7.47 +/- 2.3 mumol/l), and showed no evidence of hemolysis. A modified fasting test was performed in all of the patients. Serum bile acid levels (Merckotest, Merck Labs) and the biochemical parameters of liver function were determined before and after the fasting test. RESULTS: Our results show that to confirm the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome, the fasting test could be avoided in patients with increased unconjugated bilirubin levels if the basal levels of total serum bile acids are normal.
