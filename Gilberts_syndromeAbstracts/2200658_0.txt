This report deals with three cases of Bartter's syndrome whose symptomatology was associated with indirect hyperbilirubinemia. The bilirubin disorder was suggestive of Gilbert's syndrome, with no pathological findings being detected as far as the liver function was concerned. Furthermore, the unconjugated fraction of bilirubin increased after fasting. The therapy with indomethacin exerted beneficial effects on both electrolytes and bilirubin disorders, and the patients recovered a good healthy state. These findings suggest the possibility that Bartter's syndrome may coexist in a variety associated with indirect hyperbilirubinemia.
