The results of a study conducted both on subjects affected by constitutional hyperbilirubinaemia (Gilbert's syndrome) and healthy subjects using the charge test with crystalline bilirubin are presented. The parameters which are involved in bilirubin kinetics were established by means of non linear regression methods (the Marquardt method). 19 Gilbert syndrome patients and 12 normal control subjects were studied. Important parameters readily applicable to clinical and diagnostic evaluation of subjects suffering from familial cholemia were identified.
