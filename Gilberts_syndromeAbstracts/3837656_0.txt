Phenotyping of isoniazid acetylators in 19 Caucasoid patients with Gilbert's syndrome was achieved by evaluating the percentual of acetylisoniazid in the urine. The proportion of slow acetylators among the patients with Gilbert's syndrome was similar to those found among Caucasoids of control group. The conclusion was that Gilbert's syndrome doesn't interfere in the hepatic capacity of isoniazid acetylation.
