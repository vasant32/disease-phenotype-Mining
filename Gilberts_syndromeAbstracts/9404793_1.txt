An 18-year-old female with asymptomatic jaundice presented to the emergency department after fasting. She was referred to the regional medical center for evaluation and treatment. The diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome was made by fractionation of serum unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin fraction by alkaline methanolysis, followed by thin-layer chromatography and analysis of fasting-state levels of cholyl conjugated bile acids. Methods for diagnosing this disorder are discussed.
