Pharmacological tests, dynamic hepatoscintigraphy, spectrophotometric evaluation of serum and bile content of bilirubin fractions were performed in examination of 136 patients with Gilbert syndrome (group 1), chronic hepatitis, steatosis or hepatic cirrhosis (group 2) and 23 patients free of hepatic pathology (control group). It was established that androgenic steroids have effect on bilirubin-glucuronidation. Hyperbilirubinemia in Gilbert syndrome can be caused not only inhibition of bilirubin-glucuronidation in the liver but also defective uptake of bilirubin by hepatocytes.
