AIM: To provide a sensitive genetic screening method for rapid identification of all known length polymorphisms in the promoter region of the uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 gene comprising (TA)5, (TA)7 and (TA)8 repeats as opposed to the non-mutated (TA)6 allele. METHODS: The UGT1A1 promoter genotype was assessed in 115 subjects by means of a newly developed pyrosequencing method. PCR-generated DNA templates of heterozygous (TA)5 and (TA)7 carriers were cloned into a TOPO TA vector and verified by sequencing. In addition, a (TA)8 segment was produced by cloning to demonstrate the ability of the method to detect this mutation. RESULTS: All length polymorphisms of the UGT1A1 promoter described in the literature were clearly identified. Fifteen subjects had Gilbert's syndrome with elevated serum bilirubin associated with a homozygous (TA)7TAA/(TA)7TAA genotype. Two subjects with the rare genotypes (TA)5TAA/(TA)6TAA and (TA)5TAA/(TA)7TAA were found, where only the latter one displayed elevated serum bilirubin levels. Allelic frequencies were 0.9%, 66.1% and 33% for the (TA)5TAA, (TA)6TAA and (TA)7TAA allele, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our method enables reliable genetic single-step screening for all known length polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 gene promoter that cause Gilbert's syndrome. This facilitates pharmacogenetic-guided dosing of drugs with known toxicity metabolized by UGT1A1.
