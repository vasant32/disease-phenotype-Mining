Among possible causes of chronic hepatitis in adolescents most common are infections, autoimmune disorders and metabolic diseases. Thus, diagnostic procedures should be multidirectional. This study reports diagnosis and treatment difficulties in an 18-year-old male patient with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), ulcerative colitis (UC), chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and Gilbert syndrome. The presented case illustrates problems in diagnostics related to the presence of numerous disease conditions in one patient. It should be taken into consideration that these diseases coexisting in one patient can mutually affect their symptoms creating specific diagnostic difficulties.
