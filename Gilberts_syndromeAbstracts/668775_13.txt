The pahrmacokinetics of paracetamol after intravenous and oral administration has been studied in 6 patients with Gilbert's syndrome, and 6 healthy controls. Paracetamol clearance was significantly less in the patients (255 ml/min SE +/- 23 ml/min) than in the normal subjects (352 ml/min SE +/- 40 ml/min). Moreover, whilst paracetamol concentrations declined monoexponentially in the patients, the decline was biexponential in the controls. No difference in the bioavailability of 500 mg paracetamol given orally was observed between the two groups. The results suggest that not only is paracetamol elimination impaired in Gilbert's syndrome, but that its distribution kinetics are also abnormal. Both these findings could be attributed to a decrease in hepatic glucuronyl transferase activity.
