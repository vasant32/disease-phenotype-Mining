Sulfur amino acid metabolism was studied in patients with mild to severe forms of liver dysfunction and compared with that of healthy controls. Patients with mild liver dysfunction (for example, Gilbert's syndrome) had a normal sulfur amino acid metabolism. With increased inflammatory activity and cirrhosis (for example, chronic active hepatitis, alcohol-induced cirrhosis, and hepatic coma) a decreased ability to metabolize methionine (to cysteine, with cystathionine accumulation) and cysteine (to inorganic sulfate, with thiosulfate and N-acetylcysteine accumulation) was found. In contrast, transaminative metabolism of sulfur amino acids was preserved in patients with advanced forms of liver dysfunction, suggesting that transamination of sulfur amino acids is performed not only in the liver but also in extrahepatic tissues. Some implications of these findings are discussed.
