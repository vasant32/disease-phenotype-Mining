Jaundice is often the first and sometimes the only symptom of liver disease. Besides in parenchymal liver disease jaundice is also observed in chronic non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinemias (Crigler-Najjar type I and II, Gilbert's syndrome) and in hereditary conjugated hyperbilirubinaemias (Dubin-Johnson- and Rotor-syndrome). A specific therapy is only available for Crigler-Najjar type II which is treated with phenobarbitone.
