Polymorphic acetylation was investigated in twenty-seven patients with Gilbert's syndrome using the sulphadimidine test. Whereas the finding of 51% slow acetylators in seventy-eight control persons agreed well with the expected frequency in a continental European population, the prevalence of slow acetylators in Gilbert's syndrome was increased to 78% (P less than 0.03, Woolf's G-test). After oral administration of 14C-aminopyrine there was no significant difference between seventeen patients with Gilbert's syndrome and twenty-seven normal controls in total plasma clearance of aminopyrine (280 +/- SD 100 and 270 +/- 60 ml/min) and in the disappearance curve of 14CO2 in breath (0.23 +/- 0.04 and 0.22 +/- 0.03 h-1, respectively). Thus, whereas aminopyrine metabolism appears unaffected in the examined patients, the data documents a new association between slow acetylator status and Gilbert's syndrome.
