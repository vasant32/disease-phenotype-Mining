In 29 subjects with Gilbert's syndrome during ultrasonographic examination of the epigastrium in real time a significantly larger anteroposterior dimension of the right liver lobe (by cca 11%] was found. In the other investigated dimensions no significant deviations were found, not even a significantly higher echogeneity of the liver parenchyma. In two instances multiple cholecystolithiasis was detected. Sonography, a non-invasive method with a high yield, is an important link in the examination programme of subjects with Gilbert's syndrome.
