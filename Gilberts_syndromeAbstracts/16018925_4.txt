BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia show a significantly higher frequency of hyperbilirubinemia the patients suffering from other psychiatric disorders and the general healthy population. The objective of the current study was to determine whether patients with schizophrenia-associated idiopathic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert's syndrome, GS) have specific changes in signal intensities on fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance (MR) images. METHODS: Axial 5-mm-thick FLAIR MR images from schizophrenia patients with GS (n=18) and schizophrenia patients without GS (n=18), all diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria, were compared with age- and sex-matched non-psychiatric controls (n=18). Signal intensities in the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, thalamus, cingulate gyrus, and insula were graded relative to cortical signal intensity in the frontal lobe. RESULTS: Compared to both schizophrenia patients without GS and normal controls, the schizophrenia patients with GS showed significantly increased signal intensities in almost all regions studied. CONCLUSION: Patients with schizophrenia-associated GS have specific changes of signal intensities on FLAIR MR images, suggesting that schizophrenia with GS produces changes in the fronto-temporal cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia.
