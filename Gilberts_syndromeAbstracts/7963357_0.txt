Gilbert's syndrome is a benign, often familial condition characterized by recurrent but asymptomatic jaundice. We report two cases of recurrent jaundice due to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in Muslim subjects during the fast of Ramadan. As the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome was not suspected, both patients were extensively investigated before the relationship to fasting was recognized and the correct diagnosis made. We conclude that the possible exacerbation of Gilbert's by fasting should be borne in mind in the evaluation of Muslim patients with jaundice.
