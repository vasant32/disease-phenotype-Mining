OBJECTIVE: Whether patients with schizophrenia-associated idiopathic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert's syndrome, GS) have specific changes in brain metabolism was examined in this study. METHOD: This study applied proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to the hippocampus, basal ganglia, and vermis of the cerebellum of schizophrenic patients with GS (n=15) or without GS (n=15), all diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria, and healthy subjects (n=15). RESULTS: In the hippocampus, schizophrenic patients with GS showed a significant decrease of N-acetyl aspartate/creatine-phosphocreatinine (NAA/Cr) and myoinositol/creatine-phosphocreatinine (mI/Cr) ratios compared to healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients without GS, while schizophrenic patients without GS showed only a significant decrease of NAA/Cr compared to healthy subjects. In the basal ganglia, schizophrenic patients with GS showed a significant decrease of ml/Cr compared to schizophrenic patients without GS and healthy subjects, and schizophrenic patients with GS showed a significant decrease of NAA/Cr compared to healthy subjects. In the vermis of the cerebellum, schizophrenic patients with GS showed only a significant decrease of ml/Cr compared to healthy subjects, although schizophrenic patients without GS did not show a significant decrease of ml/Cr compared to healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that schizophrenia with GS is a more severe sub-type with regard to brain metabolism.
