Congestive heart failure usually features a mild to moderate increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity. A marked increase in AST may occur rarely and is usually preceded by prolonged shock or hypotensive episodes and is accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia. I report two patients with congestive heart failure in whom the AST activity was greater than 8000 U/L. No prior episodes of shock or hypotension occurred in these patients and the accompanying increase in bilirubin was slight. In both cases, the enzyme activity decreased sharply with improvement in the patients' circulatory status. Recognition of this entity is important to distinguish it from viral or drug-induced hepatitis.
