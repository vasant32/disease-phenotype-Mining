We describe the hematological and clinical features of homozygous Hb Luton (OMIM 141800.0172), a high affinity α-globin variant that has not been previously described in the homozygous state. The proband was found to have a high hemoglobin (Hb) concentration following a routine blood count prior to a planned appendectomy at the age of 16 years. Investigation showed that she was homozygous for both Hb Luton [α89(FG1)His→Leu (CAC>CTC), a high oxygen affinity Hb)] and homozygous for α(+)-thalassemia (α(+)-thal), while her mother, maternal aunt and half-brother were heterozygous for these conditions. Further investigation showed that she also had Gilbert's disease and Raynaud's syndrome. As far as we are aware, this is also the first reported family with a subject homozygous for both Hb Luton and α-thal so that the proband has no nomal α-globin. The parents of the proband are first cousins and originate from Pakistan.
