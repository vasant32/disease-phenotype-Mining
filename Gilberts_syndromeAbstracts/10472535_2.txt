The Gly71Arg mutation of the hepatic bilirubin UDP glucuronosyl-transferase (B-UGT) gene associated with Gilbert syndrome prevails among Japanese and its gene frequency is 0.13. Among 20 patients with acute leukaemia, 4 patients showed intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia during the course of combined chemotherapy. The Gly71Arg mutation was detected in all 4 patients with hyperbilirubinaemia, but was not found in 16 patients without hyperbilirubinaemia. Two of them were heterozygotes and one was a homozygote for the Gly71Arg mutation, and the other was a compound heterozygote of the Gly71Arg mutation and TA insertion mutation in the TATA box of the B-UGT gene. In addition to the complications leading to hyperbilirubinaemia, including liver damage due to drugs, viral infections or tumour cell infiltrations and alloimmune haemolysis, carrier status for the Gly71Arg mutation should be considered in a patient with leukaemia showing intermittent hyperbilirubinaemia during the course of chemotherapy, especially among Japanese, Koreans and Chinese owing to its prevalence in those populations.
