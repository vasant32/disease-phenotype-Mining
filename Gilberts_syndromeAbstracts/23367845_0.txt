Symptomatic psychosis is one of the central problems in research psychosomatic correlational research. My topic forthis lecture is on the research of symptomatic psychosis, which could be called one of the central problems in the field of clinical psychiatry. It is true that if a person is not physically stable, their "brain" and/or "mind" will not be calm. The opposite is equally true. 1. Are delusions of theft symptomatic psychosis In the elderly, there are some physical disease cases which developed into mental illness. For example, delusions of theft were triggered by physical diseases such as knee osteoarthritis, high blood pressure and glaucoma. I think it is possible to position these patients group as having symptomatic psychosis. 2. "Schizophrenia" is symptomatic psychosis We are thinking that there is a group that the biological material (bilirubin) in body fluid by way of hepatic failure did play a role leading to the expression of schizophrenia. Therefore I propose the following hypothesis: "there is a schizophrenia group that is an expression of a very mild kernicterus". This research started from our experiences having patients who had Gilbert's syndrome which has a high indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin. The patients also had schizophrenia. The psychological symptoms of schizophrenia fluctuated depending on the indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin levels. Also, we clarified that the frequency of patients with schizophrenia coexisting with GS is significantly higher than with other psychiatric disorders.
