The possibility that low concentrations of serum bilirubin may be associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease has been examined in a prospective study of 7685 middle-aged British men. During 11.5 years there were 737 major ischemic heart disease (IHD) events. A U-shaped relationship was observed between serum bilirubin and risk of IHD. Low bilirubin was associated with several cardiovascular risk factors, in particular smoking, low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low forced expiratory volume in 1 s, and low serum albumin. The U-shaped relationship persisted even after adjusting for several risk factors. Compared with men in the lowest fifth of the distribution (bilirubin < 7 mumol/L), those in the middle range (8-9 mumol/L) showed a 30% reduction in relative risk [RR = 0.68 (95% confidence intervals 0.51-0.89)] in IHD, whereas men in the top fifth (> 12 mumol/L) showed similar risk to the lowest fifth [RR = 0.99 (95% confidence intervals 0.73-1.34)], which persisted after exclusion of men with bilirubin > 17 mumol/L. The significance of this U-shaped relationship is unclear, but it could be interpreted as support for the role of endogenous antioxidants in the etiology of IHD.
