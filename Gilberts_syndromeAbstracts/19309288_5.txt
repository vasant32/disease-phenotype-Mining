We investigated the hypothesis that coinheritance of the common A(TA)(n)TAA promoter mutation at the UGT1A1 locus associated with Gilbert syndrome is a risk factor for gallstone formation in a homogeneous adult population, by conducting a case-control study that included 198 adult patients with cholelithiasis and 152 healthy controls both of Greek origin. Three genotypes were found: 7/7 (17.8% in controls and 23.3% in patients), 6/7 (33.5% in controls and 46.5% in patients), and normal homozygous 6/6 (48.7% in controls and 30.3% in patients). The Gilbert UGT1A1 genotypes 6/7 and 7/7 show significant association (odds ratio 2.225, 95% confidence interval 1.373-3.605, p=0.001, and odds ratio 2.101, 95% confidence interval 1.171-3.770, p=0.013, respectively) with cholelithiasis risk. This association supports the theory that genetic factors are responsible for a fraction of symptomatic gallstone disease; however, further studies are required in different ethnic groups to fully elucidate the involvement of Gilbert syndrome in gallstone disease.
