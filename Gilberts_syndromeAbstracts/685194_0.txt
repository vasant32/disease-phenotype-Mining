The total erythrocyte population was subdivided into three age groups using as criteria the stability of red blood cells to osmotic shock and the values of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity. The "old" erythrocytes constituted about 8%, "mature"--87% and "young"--5% under normal conditions. In hereditary microspherocytosis 70% of erythrocytes possessed a decreased osmotic resistance and higher G6PD activity as compared with normal state. Two categories of erythrocytes was found among "young" cells in Marchiafava-Micheli disease; one of them possessed normal osmotic resistance, the other--decreased osmotic resistance. The age composition of the erythrocyte population was normal in functional hyperbilirubinemia. Content of ATP was decreased in erythrocytes of patients with hereditary microspherocytosis, it was increased in Marchiafava-Micheli disease and approached the normal level in patients with functional hyperbilirubinemia. Concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate was similar to the normal level in erythrocytes of patients with functional hyperbilirubinemia; an inverse correlation was observed between contents of hemoglobin and of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in blood of patients with hereditary microspherocytosis and with Marchiafava-Michel disease.
