Bolivian squirrel monkeys, unlike those of Brazilian origin, exhibit a marked fasting hyperbilirubinemia (FH) similar to that observed in Gilbert's syndrome in man. Since no delays in the hepatic clearance of sulfobromophthalein or indocyanine green are present, the Bolivian monkey appears to be similar to Gilbert's type I syndrome. FH can be significantly decreased by either phenobarbital or tin-protoporphyrin pretreatment. Nicotinic acid-induced hyperbilirubinemia and delayed tolbutamide clearance were not observed as in the human syndrome.
