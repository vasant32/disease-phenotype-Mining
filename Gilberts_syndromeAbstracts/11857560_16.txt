A polymorphism in the promoter region of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A) gene is associated with Gilbert syndrome (GS), a benign form of mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. We genotyped 157 individuals from Brazil, comprising 71 Caucasians, 54 African-derived subjects, and 32 Parakan√£ Indians. Frequencies of the alelle (TA)(7) associated with GS found in this study were 0.324, 0.407, and 0.328, respectively. The genotype frequencies differed significantly between Caucasians and African-derived individuals. The high frequencies of (TA)(7) polymorphism among the three groups confirm previous data that this polymorphism is very ancient and appears to be distributed throughout the world.
