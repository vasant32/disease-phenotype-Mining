Pulmonary carbon monoxide (CO) excretion rates (VeCO) were 50% greater, on average, in Bolivian squirrel monkeys (BoSMs) which exhibit a unique fasting hyperbilirubinemia (FH), than in fasted control Brazilian squirrel monkeys (BrSMs). Since the catabolism of heme produces equimolar amounts of CO and bilirubin, the increased VeCOs are consistent with concurrent increases in endogenous bilirubin production rates. Tin-protoporphyrin, a competitive inhibitor of heme oxygenase, significantly decreased both the VeCO and serum bilirubin level in fasted BoSMs. Overproduction of bilirubin may be responsible in part for the marked FH in BoSMs.
