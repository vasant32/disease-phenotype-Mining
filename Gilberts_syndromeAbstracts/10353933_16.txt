OBJECTIVE: The incidence of nonphysiologic neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is twice as high in East Asians as in whites. We studied whether the condition was associated with mutations in the gene for bilirubin uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1), a key enzyme of bilirubin catabolism. DESIGN: We analyzed the UGT1A1 gene in 25 Japanese neonates who had nonphysiologic hyperbilirubinemia (serum bilirubin >257 micromol/L) with no obvious cause. They had all received phototherapy. The background control population consisted of 50 Japanese neonates whose transcutaneous jaundice index was monitored during the first week of life. We detected mutations by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments of the gene. RESULTS: We found a polymorphism for UGT1A1 in exon 1; a G-->A transition at nucleotide 211 caused arginine to replace glycine at position 71 of corresponding protein product (G71R). The frequency of the mutated allele in the hyperbilirubinemic group (0.34) was significantly higher (chi2 = 5.56) than in the control group (0.16). In the control group the peak transcutaneous jaundice index of the carriers of G71R was significantly higher than it was in the normal infants. CONCLUSIONS: The missense mutation causing G71R is the first reported polymorphism for UGT1A1, and the mutation is a risk factor for nonphysiologic neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The high incidence of hyperbilirubinemia in the Japanese may be attributable to the high frequency of this missense mutation.
