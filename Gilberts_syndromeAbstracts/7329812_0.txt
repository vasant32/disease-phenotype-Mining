Patients with constitutional hyperbilirubinemia and with extra intrahepatic cholestasis have been explored by means of sequential scintigraphy, with the following results: 1. in Gilbert's syndrome liver uptake and output of 131I-BSP were normal; 2. in the Dubin-Johnson syndrome liver uptake and plasma clearance of 131I-BSP were normal; the substance was retained for a long period (2 hrs) in the liver without any tendency to be excreted; 3. in the Rotor syndrome 131I-BSP uptake was delayed and liver clearance prolonged; 4. in total biliary obstruction no intestinal activity could be recorded even in the late registrations (the latest after 24 hrs); 5. in partial extrahepatic biliary obstruction there was a normal liver uptake with an abnormal retention in the choledochus and a delayed excretion (more than 2 hrs); and 6. in intrahepatic cholestasis 131I-BSP liver uptake, retention and excretion were delayed; differentiation of these cases from total biliary obstruction is difficult. Late determinations, the last 24 hrs after injection of the tracer, were performed in these cases, in order to exclude a total obstruction with parenchymal injuries, by assessing the enteral output.
