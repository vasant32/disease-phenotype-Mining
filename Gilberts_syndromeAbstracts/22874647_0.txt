Circulating unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) has been reported to protect against lung and colorectal cancer. The present study aimed to explore, for the first time, whether mildly elevated circulating UCB, as found in Gilbert`s syndrome (GS), is associated with changes of DNA damage. A random 76 individuals, matched for age and gender, were recruited from the general population and allocated into the GS group (UCB ≥ 17.1 µM; n = 38) or control group (UCB <17.1 µM; n = 38). Chromosomal and cytological changes were determined in lymphocytes and buccal cells using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay (CBMN) and buccal micronucleus cytome assay (BMcyt). No significant differences were found between GS subjects and the control group in the CBMN and BMcyt determined endpoints. Subsequently, when age dependency of effects were analysed, lower formation of buccal micronucleated cells (by 73.3%) and buccal nuclear buds (by 70.9%) in the GS subgroup ≥ 30 years were found, compared to the GS subgroup <30 years. These findings suggest DNA protection in epithelial tissue of older individuals with GS.
