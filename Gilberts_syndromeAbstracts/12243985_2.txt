A case of a woman with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDA-II), Gilbert's syndrome (GS) and trophic malleolar ulceration is described. The association of CDA-II and GS caused early gallstone formation that led the patient to undergo cholecystectomy at the age of 15. GS is typified by increased production of both unconjugated and monoconjugated bilirubin, which is more lithogenic. The development of ulcers is not typical of CDA-II, even though they are associated with many of the hemolytic anemias, and were thought in our patient to be due to a thrombophilic tendency which manifest with Antithrombin III and Protein C deficiency.
