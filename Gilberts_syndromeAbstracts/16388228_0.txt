Gilbert syndrome is benign, often familial condition characterized by recurrent but asymptomatic mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the absence of haemolysis or underlying liver disease. If, it becomes apparent, it is not until adolescence and then usually in association with stress such as intercurrent illness, fasting or strenuous exercise. Virtually all patients have decreased level of UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase, but there also is evidence for a defect in hepatic uptake of bilirubin as well. This case is reported due to its rarity. The prevalence of Gilbert syndrome in U.S is 3-7% of the population.
