99mTc-p-butyl IDA clearance was measured in three subjects with Gilbert's syndrome at the same time as traditional cholescintigraphy. Cholescintigraphy persistently revealed a delayed liver display together with a normal fast display of the biliary ways. The Tu (semi-uptake time) of 99mTc-p-butyl IDA was higher in all three cases than in normal subjects, whereas Te (semisecretion time) was normal in all cases. The typical liver function profile provided by the association of cholescintigraphy and 99mTc-p-butyl IDA hepatocyte clearance renders the examination, which is both simple and free of side-effects, extremely useful in the clinical identification of subjects with suspected Gilbert's syndrome.
