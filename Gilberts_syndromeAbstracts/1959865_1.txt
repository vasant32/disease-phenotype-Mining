delta-Aminolevulinic acid-4-[14C] and [3H]-bilirubin were administered intravenously to five patients with Gilbert's syndrome and four healthy control subjects on two occasions: before and on days 10 through 14 of a course of phenobarbital (2.5 mg/kg/day). The resulting curves of [3H]-bilirubin and [14C]-bilirubin in plasma were analyzed by computer to determine a number of parameters of physiological interest. As expected, phenobarbital produced a highly significant fall in the plasma concentration of unconjugated bilirubin as a result of a significant increase in hepatic bilirubin clearance in all subjects; plasma bilirubin turnover was unaltered. Surprisingly, the drug produced no change in the incorporation of [14C]-delta-aminolevulinic acid into [14C]-early labeled bilirubin. To explain this unexpected finding, the effects of phenobarbital (75 mg/kg/day for 6 days) on incorporation of [14C]-delta-aminolevulinic acid and 2-[14C]-glycine into [14C]-early labeled bilirubin and on the activity of the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase were studied in nonfasted, adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats. At the dose and duration of treatment used, phenobarbital administration increased total hepatic delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase activity and produced a significant increase of 70% in the incorporation of [14C]-glycine into early labeled bilirubin. By contrast, no increase in the incorporation of [14C]-delta-aminolevulinic acid into early labeled bilirubin was observed. These data suggest that delta-aminolevulinic acid is an inappropriate precursor for studies of the rate of heme biosynthesis, presumably because it bypasses delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the physiological rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway.
