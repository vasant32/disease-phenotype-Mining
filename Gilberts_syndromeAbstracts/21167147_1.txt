 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of small dense low density lipoprotein cholesterol (sd-LDL-C) in the mechanism of decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease in Gilbert's syndrome (GS). DESIGN AND METHODS: sd-LDL-C, ox-LDL, and high sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were investigated in subjects with GS (n=42) and compared to healthy controls (n=52). RESULTS: Age, gender and body mass index (BMI) distributions were similar between the two groups. sd-LDL-C, ox-LDL and hs-CRP levels were lower in GS than the healthy controls (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.001, respectively). Unconjugated bilirubin was negatively correlated with sd-LDL-C, ox-LDL and hs-CRP (r=-0.594, p<0.001; r=-0.249, p=0.016 and r=-0.373, p<0.001 respectively). In addition, sd-LDL-C was positively correlated with ox-LDL (r=0.307, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this preliminary study suggest that reduced sd-LDL-C, ox-LDL and hs-CRP levels may have a role in preventing atherosclerosis in subjects with GS.
