Gilbert's syndrome (GS) is a benign, familial condition characterized by recurrent asymptomatic non-hemolytic low-grade indirect hyper-bilirubinemia. Conditions related to fasting, stress or co-morbidity might reveal the disease in asymptomatic individuals. Seven patients who were treated for a hematological malignancy were identified with reversible indirect hyper-bilirubinemia. Liver function tests in all of them, including bilirubin levels were normal before the therapeutic maneuver, which was the delivery of combined chemotherapy in three cases and a bone marrow transplantation in four (three allografts and one autograft). Bilirubin levels returned to normal in all five patients following treatment. GS should not be overlooked in individuals exposed to these treatments who develop hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice.
