Microcirculation was studied in liver biopsies of patients with viral hepatitis, Gilbert's syndrome, liver steatosis, chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, obstructive jaundice and venous congestion. All these diseases were shown to be usually accompanied by morphologic changes of sinusoid, Disse's and intercellular spaces, cellular membranes of hepatocytes. Those changes causing microcirculation disturbances result in the functional insufficiency of the liver.
