Gilbert's syndrome is the common cause of non hemolytic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a prevalance of 3-7%. Gilbert's syndrome may introduce a selection of potential liver donors from brain death patients. We present a case of living-related liver transplantation (LRLT) from a donor with Gilbert's syndrome. A 22-year-old woman had been diagnosed as having liver cirrhosis at the age of 5. She underwent liver transplantation with the donor's left lobe as the graft. The donor, who was the father of the patient, had been diagnosed with Gilbert's syndrome. Although the recipient was well until 11 months after surgery, she died of subacute fulminant hepatitis 16 months after surgery. However, it was clear that the liver with Gilbert's syndrome could be used as a graft of living-related liver transplantation for adult recipients.
