BACKGROUND AND AIM: Low-grade fasting hyperbilirubinemia is a common observation in healthy subjects (HS), whereas high-grade fasting hyperbilirubinemia is believed to be a characteristic finding of Gilbert's syndrome. This study was undertaken to assess the role of mutation in bilirubin UDP- glycosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1) on fasting hyperbilirubinemia. METHODS: Analysis of UGT1A1 and a caloric restriction test (400 kcal for 24 h) were performed in 56 healthy subjects (25 males, 31 females), and 28 patients with Gilbert's syndrome (18 males, 10 females). There were 29 healthy subjects with no mutation in UGT1A1, and 27 healthy subjects and 26 Gilbert's syndrome patients with mutations in the coding and/or promoter (TATA box) regions of UGT1A1. RESULTS: The mean increment of serum bilirubin (DeltaSB) was 7.6 micromol/L [corrected] (males) and 4.1 micromol/L (females) in subjects with no UGT1A1 mutation. Subjects with mutation in UGT1A1 showed higher levels of DeltaSB than individuals without mutation. Among healthy subjects, gender difference in DeltaSB values was observed only in individuals with the wild type of UGT1A1, but not in those with mutations in this gene. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that UGT1A1 mutation has a role in the development of high-grade fasting hyperbilirubinemia after caloric restriction.
