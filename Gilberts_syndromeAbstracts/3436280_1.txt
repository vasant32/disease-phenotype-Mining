Between 1981 and 1986 we have investigated 143 outpatients with symptoms of G.M.S. Analysis of the different diagnostic procedures aimed at standardization of diagnostic measures in patients with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia without other abnormal physical findings. In these patients and in persons with only anamnestic disorder, diagnosis was ensured by oral application of nicotine acid. The principles of the specific diagnostic procedure are described. In general, diagnosis of G. M. S. is possible without histological investigation of liver tissue.
