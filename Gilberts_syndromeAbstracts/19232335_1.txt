OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of CD40 ligand and P-selectin in the mechanism of decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease in Gilbert's syndrome (GS). DESIGN AND METHODS: The soluble forms of CD40 ligand (sCD40L) and P-selectin (sP-selectin), and high sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were investigated in subjects with GS (n=25) and compared to healthy controls (n=53). RESULTS: sCD40L and hs-CRP levels were significantly lower in GS compared to the controls (0.33+/-0.27 vs 0.71+/-0.37 ng/mL, p<0.001 and 0.51+/-0.45 vs 1.16+/-1.31 mg/L, p=0.046, respectively). Both sCD40L and hs-CRP were negatively correlated with total bilirubin (r=-0.5, p<0.001 and r=-0.34, p=0.002, respectively). sP-selectin levels were lower in GS when compared to the controls but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.052). No correlation was found between the plasma levels of sCD40L, sP-selectin and hs-CRP. CONCLUSION: These novel findings suggest that reduced sCD40L and hs-CRP concentrations may have a role in the mechanism of protection against atherosclerosis in GS.
