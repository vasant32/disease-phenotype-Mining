Fasting and postprandial serum bile acids were determined before and after reduced caloric intake in patients with Gilbert's syndrome. Cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid were determined by radioimmunoassay. In all patients there was a pronounced increase in serum bilirubin (mean increase, 140%) after caloric restriction. However, both fasting and postprandial levels of serum bile acids were within the normal range before and after reduced caloric intake. The results indicate that different mechanisms are involved in the hepatic uptake and secretion of bile acids and bilirubin. Moreover, the results show that determinations of serum bile acids can be used to assess liver function in patients with Gilbert's syndrome irrespective of the degree of hyperbilirubinemia.
