A 41-year-old Asian-Indian male presented with recurrent episodes of jaundice over the past six months. Physical examination was normal, barring mild icterus. Laboratory parameters revealed indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Further evaluation yielded a diagnosis of severe nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency. Indirect hyperbilirubinemia was ascribed to ineffective erythropoiesis. Underlying Gilbert's syndrome was ruled out by provocative testing with lipid-restricted diet. Presentation of severe vitamin B12 deficiency with isolated hyperbilirubinemia without concomitant major haematologic or neurologic dysfunction is unusual and potentially underdiagnosed. Awareness of this possibility can permit early diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency and forestall development of severe haematologic and neurologic sequelae.
