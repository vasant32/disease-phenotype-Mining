A patient is described in whom treatment with the cholesterol-lowering agent Lovastatin (Mevacor MSD) led to a slight to moderate elevation of amylase and bilirubin with the occurrence of symptoms attributable to mild pancreatitis. These symptoms were sufficiently severe to require discontinuation of the drug. The concomitant existence of Gilbert's syndrome in this patient may have been causally related to the non-tolerance of this valuable drug. Although a penetrating ulcer cannot be ruled out in the differential diagnosis, the overall evidence favours the diagnosis of Lovastatin pancreatitis, a so far unpublished complication.
