A patient with chronic hemolytic anemia and G6PD deficiency was noted to be severely jaundiced and to have a high serum ferritin level. Analysis of his DNA revealed only heterozygosity for the c.187 C-->G (H63D) mutation of HFE, but showed that he was homozygous for the UDP glucuronosyltransferase promoter mutation of Gilbert's disease and that he had a previously undescribed mutation of G6PD, c.832 T-->C (Ser278Pro). The new variant was named G6PD La Jolla.
