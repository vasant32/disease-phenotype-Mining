Gallstone disease represents one of the most common gastroenterological disorders worldwide. Gallstones affect over 15% of adults in Europe and 25-30% of Hispanic populations in Central and South America. The heritability of gallstones varies considerably according to ethnicity, with Native Americans and Hispanics with Amerindian admixture being the most susceptible populations. Genetic factors have been shown to account for 25-30% of total gallstone risk in Europe, however, in Hispanic populations, this risk percentage may increase to 45-65%. Recent genome-wide association and candidate gene studies have identified common polymorphisms in enterohepatic transporters (ABCG5/8, SLC10A2) and the Gilbert syndrome UGT1A1 variant as genetic determinants of gallstone formation. Together, these polymorphisms cover a significant proportion of the previously predicted genetic background of gallstones in European populations. New lithogenic genes need to be discovered in future studies in high-risk populations. In this review, we address the latest developments in the genetic analysis of gallstones and discuss the ethnic background of this condition in European, Central and South American and Asian populations.
