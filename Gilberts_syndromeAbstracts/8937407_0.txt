BACKGROUND: In a recent quality assurance audit of component returns over a 6-month period, 9 of 81 returns were due to icteric plasma. With the sensitive, new methods used to screen donors for anemia and hepatitis, it seemed likely that the icteric discoloration reflected benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (Gilbert's syndrome) in the donor, rather than liver disease or hemolysis. The donors were recalled for repeat blood study to resolve this question. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Seven of the nine donors could be reached, and they submitted blood samples for measurement of serum levels of conjugated (direct-reacting) and total bilirubin and for complete blood and reticulocyte counts. RESULTS: All seven donors had mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with total bilirubin levels ranging from 1.3 to 2.8 mg per dL. None showed evidence of overt hemolysis. CONCLUSION: All seven donors of the components with icteric plasma have Gilbert's syndrome, a benign genetic anomaly occurring in approximately 3 to 5 percent of the general population. With the sensitive screening tests for viral hepatitis used today, the presence of icteric plasma in a component suggests that the donor has Gilbert's syndrome. Policies about the acceptability of icteric components from blood donors merit reassessment.
