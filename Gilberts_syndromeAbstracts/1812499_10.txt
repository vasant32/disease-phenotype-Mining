In a retrospective study, the bilirubin plasma concentrations of every patient admitted to the Psychiatric Hospital were collected. Patients suffering from liver disease, substance abuse, overt hemolysis, or increased liver enzymes were excluded. Schizophrenics showed a significantly higher incidence of hyperbilirubinemia than patients suffering from other psychiatric disorders. This phenomenon seems to be independent of drug usage and therefore points to a relationship between hyperbilirubinemia and schizophrenic psychosis. Hypothetic explanations, such as a possible genetic disposition for Gilbert Syndrome, an increased vulnerability of red-cell membranes, and the role of estrogens in schizophrenic patients, are discussed.
