A 72-year-old woman complaining of dyspnea on effort was diagnosed as having mitral regurgitation (MR). Asymptomatic jaundice had initially been noticed during primary school, and an examination had shown hyperbilirubinemia. After the diagnosis of constitutional jaundice, she had remained well without further examination or medical treatment. Laboratory data showed a total serum bilirubin (TB) level of 12.2 mg/dl and a direct bilirubin level of 0.6 mg/dl. Transesophageal echocardiography showed severe MR, and we replaced the mitral valve. Postoperatively, genetic analyses identified constitutional jaundice as Gilbert's syndrome with Y486D mutation. The TB level gradually decreased. Four years after operation she is doing well with moderate hyperbilirubinemia and a TB level of 5 mg/dl. She is free from heart failure.
