AIMS: To verify that Gilbert's syndrome, which is caused by decreased glucuronidation capacity of the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT)1A1, does not account for impaired morphine clearance. METHODS: Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for morphine and its glucuronide metabolites were compared between five carriers of Gilbert's syndrome and six noncarriers after a 7.5 mg (19.8 micro mol) intravenous injection of morphine sulphate pentahydrate. To estimate the amount of morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) formed from morphine, 1 mg of deuterized M6G was injected intravenously at the same time. RESULTS: No differences were detected between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome in the clearance of morphine (80.1 +/- 12 l h(-1) vs 87.9 +/- 22 l h(-1)) and in the percentage of morphine that was metabolized to M6G (10.9 +/- 1.4 vs 13 +/- 2). The areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves of morphine, M6G and morphine-3-glucuronide also did not differ between carriers and noncarriers of Gilbert's syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Gilbert's syndrome is not a factor to be considered when prescribing morphine.
