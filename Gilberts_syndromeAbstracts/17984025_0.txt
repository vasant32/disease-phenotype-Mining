The Gilbert-syndrome is a mild metabolism anomaly, which is spread all over the world. Every twentieth person is affected in the general population. We examined 1307 people in MH EVI at expedient operated specialist' workplaces, where we investigate work capacity evaluation in the first three months of 2006. Estimating the laboratory results, the frequent increases of total bilirubin plasma levels were remarkable, which we observed in 117 cases. Our control examinations pointed out that in 57 cases of the 117 the increase was caused by the accumulation of indirect unconjugated bilirubin. In theses cases, aimed examinations indicated neither hepatic disease nor any disease with increased hemolysis. Therefore, lack of other diagnostic sign, the abnormal value led to the diagnosis of Gilbert-syndrome. In respect of physical loading capacity, there is no united stand in the judging of Gilbert-syndrome. Therefore we made a comparison between the results of 57 patients with Gilbert-syndrome and of 57 healthy controls with the same age and gender. We made this examination in our institute, at the department which investigates the fitness for physical activity. We didn't notice any difference between the two groups' loading capacity. In consequence of our study and of other observations till now, we should re-interpret the question of restriction in the field of work. Our observations refer to a representative group. We hope this study will help in diagnostic considerations and in the correct general estimation of the importance of this metabolic anomaly.
