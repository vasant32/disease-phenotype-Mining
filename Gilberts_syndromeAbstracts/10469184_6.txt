A patient with severe haemophilia A underwent orthotopic liver transplantation because of changes correlated to end-stage liver cirrhosis due to hepatitis B, C and D infection. Replacement therapy was carried out for 4 days and the clinical course was uneventful. At the time of reporting the patient has a normal working life. FVIII plasma concentration is normal. The indirect hyperbilirubinaemia may be related to the Gilbert's anomaly of the donor.
