Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. We studied the expression of mRNAs of perforin and Fas ligand (Fas-L) in biopsy specimens from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) (15 cases) and hepatitis C (CHC) patients (13 cases). Both perforin and Fas-L mRNAs were detected in all cases of both CHB and CHC. No messages were detected in the control livers from two cases of fatty liver, a case of Gilbert's syndrome, and a case of Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Semiquantitative analysis revealed a positive correlation between the intensity of perforin and Fas-L mRNAs in both CHB and CHC. In CHB, the intensity of both perforin and Fas-L mRNAs showed a positive correlation with the histological activity and serum alanine aminotransferase level, while the correlation was not apparent in CHC. These results suggest that both perforin and Fas/Fas-L systems are involved in the pathogenesis of liver cell injury of CHB and CHC.
