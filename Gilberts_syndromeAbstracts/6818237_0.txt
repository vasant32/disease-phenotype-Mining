Initially a simple anatomical curiosity discovered at operation or autopsy, agenesis of the ball bladder has now, and despite its rarity, become of the greatest interest from a pathogenic, physiopathological and diagnostic standpoint. Embryogenesis explains that this a developmental abnormality affecting the hepatic diverticulum which is probably of genetic origin, hence its frequent association with other malformations and the hereditary nature of the condition. The usual finding of a syndrome of blockage of the sphincter of Oddi with dilatation of the common bile duct raises the problem of synergism between the sphincter of Oddi and the gall bladder. The discovery of lithiasis of the hepatic and common bile ducts in agenesis of the gall bladder leads to discussion of the reality of organ lithiasis or the role of the distended wall of the common duct. Cholecystography and echotomography would appear to be the two techniques of investigation to be recommended preoperatively in order to increase support for the presumptive diagnosis once disorders affecting neighbouring structures have been eliminated. The definite diagnosis is made peroperatively by manual exploration, peroperative cholangiography or even coeliac arteriography during the operation. The indication for surgery is based upon clinical symptomatology. This does not treat the agenesis but the associated lesions which are its complications, in particular: lithiasis the common duct, sphincter of Oddi block syndrome and dilatation of the common duct.
