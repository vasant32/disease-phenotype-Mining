We report a family with multiple lentigines syndrome and a manic-like psychosis. The psychosis and multiple lentigines syndrome are genetically unrelated, since the psychosis occurred in a maternal half-sibling of the propositus, while multiple lentigines syndrome occurred in the father of the propositus. The propositus also had Gilbert's syndrome and mitral valve prolapse. No other family members personally examined had either of these last two disorders.
