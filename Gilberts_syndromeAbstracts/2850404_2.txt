In a 33 years old woman an orthotopic liver transplantation was performed because of an endstage posthepatic liver cirrhosis. Postoperatively the unconjugated bilirubin levels remained elevated although liver enzyme values were within normal range. Because hemolysis, rejection, infection or biliary obstruction could be excluded we suspected a Gilbert's Syndrome and were able to confirm this diagnosis by low caloric intake and nicotinic acid test. This case report therefore describes the first time the transplantation of a clinically harmless metabolic disorder but inborn error of metabolism by liver grafting into the recipient.
