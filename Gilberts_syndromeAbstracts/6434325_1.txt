Bilirubin mono- and diconjugates were determined by alkaline methanolysis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in serum from patients with metastatic liver disease and liver cirrhosis. Conjugates could be detected and quantitated at normal or low total bilirubin levels. Comparison with serum alkaline phosphatase activity revealed that in cirrhosis bilirubin conjugates were sometimes detectable at normal or slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase activities. In patients with metastatic liver disease alkaline phosphatase activity was a more sensitive indicator. In normal controls and in patients with Gilbert's syndrome no bilirubin conjugates were detected whereas serum of patients with haemolysis contained conjugated bilirubin. Therefore HPLC appears to be an excellent method to diagnose Gilbert's syndrome. In liver cirrhosis HPLC is a useful liver function test.
