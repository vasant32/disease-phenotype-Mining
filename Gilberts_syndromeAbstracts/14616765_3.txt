Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I is a severe form of hereditary unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene (UGT1A1). We analyzed the bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene in a female Chinese patient with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I. Relatives of the patient were also analyzed. The patient was homozygous for a nonsense mutation of R341X. The patient's father, sister and brother, all diagnosed with Gilbert's syndrome, were compound heterozygotes of R341X, P229Q, and an insertion mutation of the TATA box [A(TA)7TAA]. Heterozygotes of nonsense mutations (Q331X and C280X) in our previous study had either Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II or Gilbert's syndrome, but heterozygotes of R341X (mother and grandmothers) were normal. An in vitro expression study of homozygous and heterozygous models of R341X showed 0 and 58%, respectively, of normal enzyme activity. Therefore, the present results indicate that carriers of the nonsense mutation could be normal for plasma bilirubin concentration, Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II. The results also suggest the importance of the accumulation of prevalent or polymorphic mutation in the etiology of Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome type II.
