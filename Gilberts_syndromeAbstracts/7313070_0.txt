Kinetic studies on exogenous bilirubin were performed in 15 patients with Gilbert's syndrome, according to a bicompartmental model using a recently proposed method which studies all the compartmental parameters and therefore give complete information about bilirubin metabolism. Impaired bilirubin uptake was confirmed in Gilbert's syndrome, in comparison with normal subjects; our data are in agreement with those of other authors. The method adopted allows the identification of forms with associated haemolysis.
