Gilbert's syndrome is a common inherited metabolic disorder, caused by genetic aberration in the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase 1A1 that leads to reduced glucuronidation of bilirubin. Recent advances in molecular genetics have frequently reported the concurrence of dual genetic polymorphisms in UDP glucuronosyl-transferases 1A6 and 1A1 in patients with Gilbert's syndrome, leading to defective glucuronidation of bilirubin, as well as several other endogenous and exogenous substrates, such as serotonin. We present a case of Gilbert's syndrome with severe persistent hyperserotoninaemia, mimicking carcinoid syndrome, due to dual polymorphisms in UDP-glucuronosyl-transferases 1A1 and 1A6. The patient was treated with a long-acting somatostatin analogue (octreotide) for 8 months, resulting in a significant reduction in serum serotonin levels and immediate relief of the symptomatology, followed by a long-term remission. The frequent occurrence of hyperserotoninaemia in Gilbert's syndrome may contribute, at least partly, to the nonspecific symptomatology commonly seen in these patients and should be promptly evaluated.
