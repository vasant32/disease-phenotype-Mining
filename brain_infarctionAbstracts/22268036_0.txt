The neuroprotective and antiamnestic effects of GK-2 dipeptide (nerve growth factor mimetic) were studied on rats with photoinduced bilateral focal ischemia of the prefrontal cortex. Intraperitoneal injection of GK-2 in a dose of 1 mg/kg on days 1, 2, 4, and 6 postoperation led to a 62% reduction of cortical infarction volume on day 9 and completely preserved conditioned passive avoidance response trained before stroke.
