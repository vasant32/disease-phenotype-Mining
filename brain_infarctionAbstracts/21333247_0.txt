We report the occurrence of cerebro-vascular accident, following selective embolization of internal maxillary artery (IMA) in a young male patient aged 18 years admitted at ENT Department, Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH) with diagnosis of recurrent juvenile nasophayrngeal angiofibroma (JNA). Angiography and selective trans-femoral embolization was done as an adjunctive measure before the definite surgical removal of this benign tumourous condition. The child developed weakness of the right half of body with slurred speech and drowsiness. CT scan of brain revealed the diagnosis of postembolization infarction. The patient recovered with no obvious signs of clinical residual weakness. Surgical excision after ligation of feeding vessel has been planned.
