The detection of asymptomatic lacunar infarcts on magnetic resonance (MR) images is important because their presence indicates an increased risk of severe cerebral infarction. However, accurate identification of lacunar infarcts on MR images is often hard for radiologists because of the difficulty in distinguishing lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. Therefore, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme for the classification of lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. Our database consisted of T1- and T2- weighted images obtained from 109 patients. The locations of lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces were determined by an experienced neuroradiologist. It included 89 lacunar infarcts and 20 enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. We first enhanced the lesions in T2-weighted image by using the white top-hat transformation. A gray-level thresholding was then applied to the enhanced image for the segmentation of lesions. From the segmented lesions, we determined image features, such as size, shape, location, and signal intensities in T1- and T2- weighted images. A neural network was then employed for distinguishing between lacunar infarcts and enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. Our computerized method was evaluated by using a leave-one-out method. The result indicated that the area under the ROC curve was 0.945. Therefore, our CAD scheme would be useful in assisting radiologists for diagnosis of silent cerebral infarctions in MR images.
