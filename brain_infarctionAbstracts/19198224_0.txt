A 31-year-oldman presented with a 6-month history of right testicular enlargement. The patient underwent a right inguinal orchiectomy. Histopathological examination showed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (choriocarcinoma>seminoma) which was confined to the tunica albuginea. The postoperative serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and lactate dehydrogenase were normal. Serum level of human chorionic gonadotrophin(HCG), however, was 23,000 mIU/ml (normal, < 0.7 mIU/ml). A thoracic computed tomography (CT) at that time showed bilateral and multiple metastases to the lungs but the abdominal CT was normal. After the surgery, the patient was treated with conventional doses of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin. On day 11 of the second chemotherapy course, the patient developed confusion and right sided weakness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an ischemic lesion in the left middle cerebral artery area. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function and no valvular vegetations. Finally, the patient completed one additional course of chemotherapy with considerable measures to prevent side effects. A thoracic CT at the end of the third cycle showed no evidence of tumor. At 3 months followup after chemotherapy, he suffered from partial paralysis of right-sided upper and lower limbs but due to intensive rehabilitation he overcame the paralysis and is able to walk by himself. There was no evidence of tumor recurrence.
