A 57-year-old man, operated eight years before for a left frontal falx meningioma, presented with short lasting, stereotyped episodes of paresthesias ascending from the right foot to the hand. A diagnosis of somatosensory seizures with jacksonian march was made. The patient was given antiepilectics but 5 days later, a few hours after another paresthesic episodes, he developed right hemiplegia, hemianesthesia and dysartria due to an infarct of left capsular posterior limb. We deem that in this patient the paresthesic episodes were more likely an expression of a capsular warning syndrome than of parietal epilepsy because of the frontal localization of the surgical lesion, the absence of motor components in all episodes, the negativity of repeated EEG, and the lack of recurrences after stroke. In capsular warning syndrome sensory symptoms mimicking a jacksonian march can be due to ischemic depolarization progressively recruiting the somatotopically arranged sensory fibers in the posterior capsular limb.
