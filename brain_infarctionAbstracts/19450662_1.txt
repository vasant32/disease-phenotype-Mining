Motor deficit improvement is limited in rats with a large sensorimotor cortex infarct, even with cortical stimulation during rehabilitation. However, we find prolonged stimulation that differs with the size of cortical lesion to be effective. Two weeks of prolonged epidural electrical stimulation and rehabilitative training were delivered to rats whose cortex had been subjected to photothrombotic infarct after training in a single-pellet reaching task. Continuous stimulation greatly improved recovery in animals with large infarcts (6 mm diameter), while intermittent stimulation was more effective in animals with small (4 mm) lesions. Thus, prolonged cortical stimulation is a strategy to enhance motor recovery in photothrombotic infarct model rats. However, pattern and duration of stimulation requires modification depending on the extent of infarct.
