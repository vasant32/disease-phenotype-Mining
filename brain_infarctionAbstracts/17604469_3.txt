BACKGROUND: The hospital-based stroke registry is useful for understanding diverse clinical characteristics of stroke related to geographical, racial, or environmental differences. METHODS: The Khorasan Stroke Registry was established for evaluation of incidence, clinical manifestations, risk factors, topography, and etiology of ischemic stroke in Southern Khorasan, Iran, during 2001 - 2005. Consecutive stroke patients underwent a standard battery of diagnostic investigations by a stroke neurologist. Topography and etiology of brain infarction was determined based on the Practical Iranian Criteria classification. RESULTS: The incidence of ischemic stroke in Khorasan population is 43.17 cases per 100,000 people per year. During a 5-year period 1,392 ischemic stroke patients (738 females, 654 males) were evaluated in the Khorasan Stroke Registry. Atherosclerosis constituted 53.6% of etiologies followed by uncertain causes (19.9%), cardioembolism (11.8%), and miscellaneous etiologies (2.9%). Eleven point seven percent of our patients had both atherosclerosis and cardioembolic mechanisms. Rheumatic valvular disease was present in 44.8% of cardioembolic strokes and caused 4.31 preventable stroke cases per 100,000 Iranian population per year. Hypertension and history of ischemic cerebrovascular events were the most frequent risk factors, 53.1% and 22.3% respectively. In-hospital mortality of our ischemic stroke patients was 7.3%. CONCLUSION: High frequency of atherosclerotic etiology in the Khorasan Stroke Registry is because of its classification criteria, which does not separate small vessel territory infarcts as a different etiologic subtype. Rheumatic valvular disease is an important cause of stroke in Khorasan population.
