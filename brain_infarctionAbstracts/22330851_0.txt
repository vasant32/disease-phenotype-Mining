A 20-year-old man developed right homonymous hemianopia, hemiparesis, and hemisensory loss from deep cerebral venous thrombosis in the setting of high altitude. Approximately 3 months later, brain MRI showed encephalomalacia of the left optic tract and lateral geniculate nucleus, as well as signal abnormalities of the internal capsule and posterolateral thalamus. Homonymous hemianopia has previously been described in 1 case after deep cerebral venous thrombosis but without detailed neuroimaging features.
