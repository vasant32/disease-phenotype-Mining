In 106 slightly anaesthetised adult mongolian gerbils one common carotid artery (CCA) was ligated and the blood pressure in the distal and in the proximal stump was monitored for 8 minutes. The mean distal CCA stump pressure of the 39 nonsurvivors was 15 (+/- 6) mm Hg, that of the 25 survivors with retinocerebral infarcts was 25 (+/- 6) mm Hg, and that of the 42 intact survivors was 31 (+/- 7) mm Hg. The corresponding mean arterial blood pressures (MABP), as measured in the proximal CCA stump, were 81 (+/- 12) mm Hg, 84 (+/- 13) mm Hg, and 87 (+/- 11) mm Hg, respectively. There were no differences between the samples concerning sex, body weight, rectal temperature, arterial blood gases, arterial pH, and haematocrit. Measurements in a second series of 10 awake gerbils showed that the mean values of MABP, heart rate, and respiratory rate of the nonsurvivors were less than those of the survivors during 90 minutes after CCA ligation. It is inferred that in the mongolian gerbil the lower threshold of the arterial blood pressure for the development of brain infarcts ranges within 22 and 25 mm Hg, that is, within the values found in monkeys and cats. The longlasting depression of respiration and circulation in the nonsurvivors is considered to be related to the phenomenon of diaschisis .
