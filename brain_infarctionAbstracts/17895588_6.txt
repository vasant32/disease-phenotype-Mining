Previous studies revealed that Guizhi-Fuling-Capsules (GZFLC), a traditional Chinese medical (Kampo) formulation composed of five kinds of medicinal plants, Cinnamomum cassia BLUME (Cinnamomi Cortex), Paeonia lactiflora PALL. (Peonies Radix), Paeonia suffruticosa ANDREWS (Moutan Cortex), Prunus persica BATSCH (Persicae Semen), and Poria cocos WOLF (Hoelen), exerts a protective effect against vascular injury and has a protective effect against glutamate- or nitro oxide-mediated neuronal damage. In the present study, the effect of GZFLC in a rat in vivo model of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion was investigated. Administration of GZFLC (0.3 and 0.9 g/kg, p.o.) after focal cerebral ischemia significantly decreased brain infarction and water contents in rats subjected to 2-h ischemia followed by 24-h reperfusion from 31.72 +/- 2.49%, 84.76 +/- 1.63% in the model group to 17.31 +/- 3.66%, 82.51 +/- 1.36% and 8.30 +/- 3.73%, 81.35 +/- 1.73%, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of inflammatory cytokines in ischemic brain showed that GZFLC treatment significantly down-regulated expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1beta and tissue necrosis factor-alpha and markedly up-regulated expressions of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-10R both in mRNA and protein levels. The serum levels of these inflammatory cytokines were also regulated the same way. These results suggested that GZFLC may be beneficial for the treatment of brain ischemia-reperfusion injury partly due to its anti-inflammatory properties.
