The frequency, course and clinical significance of changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during bacterial meningitis were investigated in 14 adult patients. The results of 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were compared with the clinical signs and findings using cerebral angiography and conventional CT. HMPAO SPECT was performed 2-15 days (median 4.5 days) after the onset of neurological disease. Decreased HMPAO accumulation was detected in 13 patients. SPECT studies revealed focal hypoperfusion corresponding to the clinical symptoms in 6 patients suffering from hemiparesis or hemiataxia. Conventional cranial CT disclosed brain infarction in only 1 patient. Focal hypoperfusion was also found in 7 of 8 patients without clinical evidence of focal neurological deficits. In 6 patients, HMPAO SPECT findings were abnormal although cerebral angiography was normal. At follow-up examinations 3-45 weeks after the acute disease, abnormalities revealed by HMPAO SPECT had improved or had even disappeared in all patients studied. Our results indicate that reduced rCBF is a frequent finding in bacterial meningitis in the adult. In most patients it probably represents a functional and reversible disorder without structural lesion detectable on CT.
