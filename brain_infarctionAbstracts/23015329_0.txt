 AIM: Obstruction of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and collateral bridging veins is a well-known reason of postoperative brain edema and brain infarct, however, morphometric anatomic studies done in the light of surgical landmarks aren't sufficient in number. Object of this study is to describe venous structures related to SSS with silicon injected cadaveric models. MATERIAL and METHODS: This study was on 6 silicon injected cadaveric heads at Anatomy Department. Duramater was removed and veins on parasagittal area were examined. SSS morphology, veins draining into SSS, their size, number and distance were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean vein number draining into SSS is 2.9±1.5 at anterior to coronal suture (CS), between CS and vertex is 3.2±0.8, between vertex and lambdoid suture (LS) is 2.3±0.9, between LS and confluens sinuum 0.3±0.5. There was no statically difference between right and left sides (p=0.140, p > 0.05). Diameter of veins was 2.4±1.0 mm at anterior to CS, 3.0±1.2 mm at between CS and vertex, 2.4±0.7 mm at between vertex and LS, and 2.2±0.5 mm at between LS and confluens sinuum. CONCLUSION: Knowing details of anatomic structures of SSS and venous structures draining into it may protect the patients from many surgical complications. SSS and related structures with surgical landmarks are valuable for neurosurgeons.
