BACKGROUND: Cerebrovascular disease is a cause of dementia and is associated with elevated plasma levels of homocysteine. Patients with AD tend to have unexplained elevations of homocysteine concentrations vs healthy control subjects. Vitamin B(6) status, a potential determinant of plasma homocysteine, has not been characterized in patients with AD. OBJECTIVE: To investigate plasma homocysteine, vitamin B(6) status, and the occurrence of vascular disease in patients with AD. METHODS: Forty-three patients with AD and 37 control subjects without AD were studied for homocysteine, B vitamin status (folate, vitamin B(12), pyridoxal-5'-phosphate [PLP]), kidney function (creatinine), and thyroid function (thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroxin). In addition, the presence of vascular disease was assessed by reviewing both medical histories and brain imaging data provided by CT and MRI. RESULTS: The OR for elevated plasma homocysteine (>12 micromol/L) was only 2.2 (not significant) for subjects with AD. In contrast, the OR was 10.0 (p = 0.03) for subjects with vascular disease (n = 26). The OR for low plasma PLP (<25 nmol/L) was 12.3 (p = 0.01) for patients with AD. No significant relationship was observed between vascular disease and PLP level or between plasma homocysteine and PLP concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma homocysteine in patients with AD appears related to vascular disease and not AD pathology. In addition, low vitamin B(6) status is prevalent in patients with AD. It remains to be determined if elevated plasma homocysteine or low vitamin B(6) status directly influences AD pathogenesis or progression.
