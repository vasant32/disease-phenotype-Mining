Ischemic infarcts of the thalamus involve one or two of its four arterial territories that are usually supplied by the posterior cerebral (PCA) and the posterior communicating (PCoA) arteries. We report a patient who suffered ischemic infarcts in all arterial territories of the right thalamus. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography showed an occlusion of the right PCA and failed to visualize a PCoA. We assume that the absence of a relevant thalamic blood supply deriving from the PCoA enabled PCA occlusion to cause infarcts in all thalamic territories.
