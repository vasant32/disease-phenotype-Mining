Perioperative cardiovascular morbidity represents a major health-care challenge. Morbidity after coronary artery surgery annually consumes $750 million in health-care resources in-hospital and about $500 million in posthospitalization care. Of the 25 million patients who undergo noncardiac surgery annually in the United States, more than 1 million suffer postsurgical cardiovascular morbidity. The annual in-hospital cost of this morbidity is $10 billion, with posthospitalization care costing $12 billion more. Early efforts to reduce perioperative cardiovascular and central nervous system morbidity focused largely on the development and use of technologies designed to achieve earlier detection of end-point surrogates. However, despite advances in the early detection of infarction surrogates, perioperative heart and brain infarctions remain urgent problems. Future advances in perioperative care will require large-scale therapeutic trials of agents intended to alter outcome. The McSPI Research Group is a unique international, multicenter research organization focused on the problems of heart attack and stroke, with the goals of identifying not only effective therapies, but also developing the academic careers of clinical investigators.
