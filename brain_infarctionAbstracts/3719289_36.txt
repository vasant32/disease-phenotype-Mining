Recent evidence suggests that poststroke depression is associated with the location of the brain infarct, proximity to the frontal pole being associated with greater depression following left hemisphere injury, and an opposite relationship being seen with injury to the right hemisphere. This study was designed to replicate and extend previous investigation of this issue. Depression was assessed following recent stroke in patients with localized right (n = 16) or left (n = 19) hemisphere lesions. No overall differences between these groups were found on several measures of depression. Although there appeared to be a negative linear relationship between severity of depression and distance of the lesion from the frontal pole in left hemisphere patients, this association failed to attain statistical significance. A curvilinear relationship was evident in right hemisphere patients, with anterior and posterior lesions associated with high depression scores. These data support the notion that lesion location is associated with the severity of poststroke depression, although the nature of this association may be more complex than has previously been suggested.
