We detected a significant decrease in plasma thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) levels together with a significant increase in plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TXB2 ratio in young healthy non-alcoholic male volunteers after acute ingestion of ethanol (1.5 g/kg). Paradoxically, during ethanol intoxication and the following hangover a significant increase in ADP-induced formation of TXB2 by the platelet rich plasma could be observed, which suggests that ethanol intoxication via some unknown mechanism sensitized platelets to produce TXB2. Whether these observations contribute to the increased risks of subarachnoid haemorrhage or ischaemic brain infarction among occasional heavy drinkers recently described by us remains to be proved.
