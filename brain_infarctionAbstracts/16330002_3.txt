Inflammation is a factor in the aggravation of reperfusion injury after cerebral ischemia. Since histamine H(2) receptor stimulation suppresses inflammatory reactions, effects of the central histaminergic activation on brain infarction were examined in rats. Focal cerebral ischemia for 2 h was provoked by transient occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, and the infarct size was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain after 24 h. Effects of postischemic administration of thioperamide, an H(3) antagonist, and metoprine, an inhibitor of histamine-N-methyltransferase, were evaluated in rats treated with l-histidine, a precursor of histamine. Furthermore, effects of these agents on changes in the striatal histamine level were examined by a microdialysis procedure. Focal ischemia provoked marked damage in rats treated with l-histidine (1000 mg/kg) alone. Administration of l-histidine (1000 mg/kg) with either thioperamide (5 mg/kg) or metoprine (10 mg/kg) alleviated brain infarction. The size of brain infarction was 27% and 10% of that in animals treated solely with l-histidine, respectively. The combination treatment with thioperamide and metoprine decreased the size of brain infarction in rats given l-histidine (500 mg/kg), although protective effects were not clear without l-histidine. A marked increase in the histamine concentration was observed in the histidine plus metoprine group, the value being 363% of that in the saline-injected group after 2-3 h. The histamine concentrations in the histidine group and histidine plus thioperamide group were 188% and 248%, respectively. These findings indicate that facilitation of central histaminergic activity reduced the brain infarction.
