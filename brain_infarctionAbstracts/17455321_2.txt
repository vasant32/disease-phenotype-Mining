Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment improves functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke, inducing reperfusion by its thrombolytic activity. Conversely, there is evidence that rt-PA can mediate neuronal damage after ischemic brain injury in vivo. In addition to other mechanisms, enhancement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signalling has been proposed to underlie rt-PA-mediated neurotoxicity. However, the role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation, which mediates postischemic excitotoxic cell death, in rt-PA-mediated aggravation of ischemic brain injury has not been established and was therefore addressed in this study. After permanent focal cerebral ischemia, intravenous rt-PA application significantly increased early postischemic PARP-1 activation within ischemic hemispheres and infarct volumes compared with control mice without affecting cerebral blood flow. Rt-PA induced increase in PARP-1 activation, and infarct volumes could be blocked by the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide. Moreover, the rt-PA-induced increase in PARP-1 activation was also prevented by the NMDA antagonist MK-801. In summary, we demonstrate that rt-PA treatment enhances postischemic PARP-1 activation, which contributes to rt-PA induced aggravation of ischemic brain injury in vivo. Furthermore, we provide evidence that NMDA receptor activation is required for rt-PA-mediated effects on postischemic PARP-1 activation.
