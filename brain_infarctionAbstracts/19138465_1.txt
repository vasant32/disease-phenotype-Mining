OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to analyse the distribution of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in patients with ischemic stroke and study the relationship between CMBs and the severity of old lacunar infarcts and cerebral white matter changes. METHODS: The study population consisted of 247 consecutive inpatients with ischemic stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging findings of these inpatients were observed. CMBs were counted respectively according to their locations, including the corticosubcortical regions, basal ganglia, thalami, brainstem and cerebellum. The number of the old lacunes and the severity of the cerebral white matter changes were also recorded. Based on the occurrence of CMBs, the patients were divided into two groups (72 patients with CMBs; 175 patients without CMBs). RESULTS: The most common location of CMBs in patients with ischemic stroke was the basal ganglia, followed by the corticosubcortical region, the thalami, the brainstem and the cerebellum. The severity of CMBs was closely correlated with the severity of lacunar infarcts and cerebral white matter changes, respectively. DISCUSSION: CMBs are closely related with cerebral microangiopathy and may be a marker of advanced stage cerebral microangiopathy.
