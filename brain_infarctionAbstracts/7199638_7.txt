Among 54 consecutive patients with acute nonseptic embolic brain infarction, there was CT evidence of hemorrhagic infarction in 1 patient (2%). None had clinical or CT evidence of massive brain hemorrhage even when anticoagulation therapy was used immediately. Seven patients (13%) had recurrent brain emboli, all within 7 days of the initial stroke. None of these patients was adequately anticoagulated at the time of recurrence. Immediate anticoagulation therapy should be employed after nonseptic embolic brain infarction if CT does not show hemorrhage and there is a persistent cardiac source of emboli.
