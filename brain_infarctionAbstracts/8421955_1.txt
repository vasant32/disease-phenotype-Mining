MCA occlusion in animals is a common model for experimental stroke. In previous studies we have shown that one of the factors, which influence evolution of an infarct is microthrombosis in the area of infarction and in the surrounding brain tissue. The present study was undertaken for assessment of the number of microthrombi and of the size of brain infarcting in rats treated with the antiaggregatory substance Triflusal. 7 groups of Sprague-Dawley rats, each group consisting of 6 animals, underwent transsphenoidal MCA occlusion. The animals received Triflusal in various amounts from day 2 till day 6. At day 7 animals were decapitated and the brains were fixed in formaldehyde. The brain was dissected at the level of the optic chiasm and embedded in paraffin. Fresh microthrombi were detected py PTAH (Phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin) staining. In each animal the hemisphere with the ischemic lesion as well as the contralateral hemisphere were examined. The area of both hemispheres was calculated by subtraction of the ventricle area from the total brain area of a section. Infarct was defined as the region of necrosis which was sharply demarcated from normal brain. The infarcted area was planimetrically measured to obtain a ratio of infarcted to normal brain. A correlation between the effect of Triflusal, number of microthrombi and size of the infarcted area could be demonstrated. The pathogenetic role of the microthrombi in the evolution of cerebral infarction as well as the effect of Triflusal in different dosages on the number of microthrombi could be clearly assessed by quantitative morphometry.
