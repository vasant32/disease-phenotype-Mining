Peroxynitrite is responsible for nitration in vivo, whereas myeloperoxidase can also catalyze protein nitration in the presence of high NO2(-) levels. Recent reports of myeloperoxidase-mediated enzyme inactivation or lipid peroxidation have suggested a role of myeloperoxidase in various pathological conditions. To clarify the role of myeloperoxidase in ischemic brain injury, the authors measured nitrotyrosine formation and infarct volume in myeloperoxidase-deficient or wild-type mice subjected to 2-hour focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, infarct volume was significantly larger in myeloperoxidase-deficient mice than in wild-type mice (81 +/- 20 mm(3) vs. 52 +/- 13 mm(3), P < 0.01), and nitrotyrosine levels in the infarct region were higher in myeloperoxidase-deficient mice than in wild-type mice (13.4 +/- 6.1 microg/mg vs. 9.8 +/- 4.4 microg/mg, P = 0.13). Fourteen hours after reperfusion, the nitrotyrosine level was significantly higher in myeloperoxidase-deficient mice than in wild-type mice (3.3 +/- 2.9 microg/mg vs. 1.4 +/- 0.4 microg/mg, P < 0.05). The authors conclude that the absence of myeloperoxidase increases ischemic neuronal damage in vivo, and that the myeloperoxidase-mediated pathway is not responsible for the nitration reaction in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
