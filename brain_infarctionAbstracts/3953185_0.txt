Study of the cerebral hemodynamics in 52 patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery made it possible to ascertain the factors responsible for a bilateral decrease in the cerebral blood flow. The identification of the causes of a decreased cerebral blood supply in this pathology may contribute to timely rational treatment of patients and to reducing the risk of repeated cerebral infarction.
