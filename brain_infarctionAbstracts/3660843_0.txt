Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 17 patients less than 3 days after brain infarction (measurement 1) and during recovery 7 +/- 2 days after infarction (measurement 2) were analysed for organic acids (energy metabolites, keto acids and amino acids). Clinical parameters improved by 32% over the period of assessment. Only serum pyruvate levels were elevated at both measurement times. Acute infarction was characterized by significant correspondence of serum and CSF concentrations for pyruvate and alpha-oxo-beta-methyl valeric acid which was lost during the recovery period. Amino acids of the L-system were roughly doubled (phenylalanine 7-fold in the CSF); increased concentrations were recorded for amino acids of the basic transport system, while amino acids of the A-system stayed unchanged (with the exception of alpha-amino butyric acid--20-fold in CSF). Except in the case of taurine, serum and CSF amino acid concentrations remained unchanged between the two measurement times. Mutual dependence of CSF and serum amino acid concentrations, existing initially for glycine, valine, leucine, tyrosine, as well as ornithine, lysine and histidine was lost in the recovery phase. This is interpreted as indication of a normalization of the blood-brain barrier.
