The authors present the case of a 49-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of "not eating well." She was found to have a heart murmur, a focal neurological deficit, and large mitral valve vegetation. The patient was later diagnosed with acute Pseudomonal endocarditis with septic emboli to the brain, liver, spleen, and kidneys. A discussion of the patient presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and outcome are reviewed.
