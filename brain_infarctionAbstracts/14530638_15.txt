BACKGROUND: Cerebral vasospasm is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study is designed to determine whether the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm and the overall clinical outcome differ between patients treated with surgical clipping compared with endovascular obliteration of aneurysms. METHODS: In this prospective study, 98 patients with aneurysmal SAH were treated. Seventy-two patients underwent surgery and clipping and 26 had coil embolization. The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, permanent neurologic deficit due to vasospasm and clinical outcome were analyzed. Patients with better clinical and radiological grades (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grades I-III and Fisher grades I-III) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Symptomatic vasospasm occurred in 22% of the patients; 25% in the surgical group and 15% in the endovascular group. Nine percent of the patients in the surgical group and 7% in the endovascular group suffered ischemic infarction with permanent neurological deficit. These differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.42). For patients with better clinical and radiological grades, no significant difference was found for the rate of symptomatic vasospasm; 23% in the surgical and 12% in the endovascular group (p = 0.49). The overall clinical outcome was comparable in both groups, with no difference in the likelihood of a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 3 or less (15% in the surgical and 16% in the endovascular group; p = 0.87). The same results for outcome were obtained for the subgroup of patients with better clinical grades on admission. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic vasospasm and ischemic infarction rate seem comparable in both groups, even for patients with better clinical and radiological admission grades. There is no significant difference in the overall clinical outcome at the long-term follow-up between both groups.
