OBJECTIVE: The Leiden V mutation, which causes activated protein C resistance and thrombophilia, has been found to be a risk factor for venous thrombosis. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) D allele indirectly exerts an unfavourable effect on the vasoregulatory system. In this study, the frequency of these mutations was analysed in different subtypes of ischaemic stroke. METHOD AND MATERIAL: According to the clinical and radiological features 664 Hungarian patients who had suffered acute ischaemic stroke were divided into 3 subtypes: small and large vessel infarcts and a mixed type. In all 664 patients, the Leiden V mutation and ACE I/D polymorphism were examined by means of the PCR technique. The frequencies of the different genotypes for the Leiden V mutation and ACE I/D polymorphism in the 3 subgroups of stroke were compared with 199 stroke-free control subjects whose MRI findings were normal. RESULTS: No significant associations were found between the overall group of cerebral infarctions and the Leiden V, ACE I/D and ACE D/D genotypes. The ACE D/D genotype was significantly more common in the patients with small deep infarcts (40.3%; p < 0.0005; OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.49-3.57) than in the control group (22.6%). The Leiden V mutation was significantly more common in patients with large infarcts (13.6%; p < 0.025; OR 2.25, CI 1.16-4.34) than in the stroke-free control subjects (6.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The ACE D/D genotype possibly contributes to the occurrence of small-vessel infarcts rather than large vessel infarcts. The Leiden V mutation might predispose to large brain infarcts. Neither the Leiden V factor nor the ACE D/D genotype has been proved to be a risk factor for ischaemic stroke as a whole.
