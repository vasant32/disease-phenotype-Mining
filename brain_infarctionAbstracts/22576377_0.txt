 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this hospital-based cohort study was to clarify the independent association between silent brain infarct (SBI) and arterial stiffness indicated by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) including the cutoff value for SBI. METHODS: We studied 240 consecutive patients (mean age 69 years) with no history of stroke. We assessed the presence of SBI, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and risk factors. Arterial stiffness was evaluated using baPWV. We measured the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (CCAIMT) using carotid ultrasonography. We divided patients into two groups according to the presence or absence of SBI, and compared clinical characteristics between the two groups. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, increased baPWV [by 1 m/s; odds ratio (OR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.25] was independently associated with SBI. The baPWV cutoff value for SBI was 17.49 m/s. Patients with baPWV≥17.49 m/s had a higher possibility of the presence of SBI (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.02-5.34) compared with patients with baPWV <17.49 m/s. Furthermore, the adjusted OR for the presence of SBI of the combination of baPWV≥17.49 m/s and CCAIMT≥1.1 mm (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.24-6.11) was higher compared with that of baPWV≥17.49 m/s (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.11-5.65). CONCLUSION: Arterial stiffness is independently associated with SBI. Measurement of baPWV can indicate the presence of SBI, especially in patients with baPWV≥17.49 m/s.
