We report a 40-year-old man with myotonic dystrophy who survived for 5 years after pontine infarction. Serial MRI detected abnormal T2 elongation of the corticospinal tract at the cerebral peduncle 4 years after the infarction. An autopsy confirmed the existence of retrograde degeneration extending from the pons to the internal capsule, evidence that retrograde degeneration in the corticospinal tract occurs above the pontine level. MRI was suggested to be useful for detection of the degenerative process.
