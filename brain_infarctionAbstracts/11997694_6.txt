The NMDA antagonist CGX-1007 (Conantokin-G) has previously been shown to possess potent neuroprotective properties when administered intracranially following experimental ischemic brain injury. Using the same model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in rats we now report the neuroprotective effects of CGX-1007 when delivered intrathecally (i.t.). When given 4 h post-occlusion, a reduction in brain infarction was measured along with significant neurological recovery. Furthermore, we describe an i.t. neuroprotective therapeutic window lasting > or = 8 h from the start of the injury. Critically, this is the first comprehensive report of a neuroprotective agent that can be administered i.t. to ameliorate experimental brain injury and potentially provide an excellent therapeutic window as a neuroprotection treatment.
