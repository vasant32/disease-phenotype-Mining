In 56 patients, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was performed 14 days (median) after a non-disabling carotid-related stroke with a perioperative minor stroke rate of 3.6%. Even large ischemic brain infarcts on CT scan did not exclude patients from CEA, as long as the patient had reached a neurologic plateau. The data from this study indicate that CEA can be performed safely in properly selected patients, and might reduce the high risk of a recurrent stroke (5%-9.5% within 30 days).
