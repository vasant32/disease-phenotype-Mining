Non-invasion model for photochemically induced brain infarction was used to study the effect of a the new anti-ischemic drug LB ("Plaferon") in albino rats. Intensity of a local blood flow was measured so as oxygen tension in brain cortex. Square and volume of the disturbed nervous tissue region, capillary length and density of distribution of different caliber vessels were detected by means of light microscopy in serial sections of brain cortex. Preliminary introduction of LB was found to prevent formation of thrombotic infarction (the volume of cortical zone damaged is 85% lower as compared to the control). Anti-ischemic effect of LB implicates in vasodilatory action on cerebral vessels and also breaking pathogenic chain of ischemia development.
