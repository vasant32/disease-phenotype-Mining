Our aim was to delimit prognostic factors in supratentorial stroke based on data obtained upon hospitalization. We studied two series of patients, the first being 150 with brain infarct and the second 135 having intracerebral haemorrhage. We analyzed: age, Glasgow and Canadian scales, glucose and urgence haemogram and the size of the lesion across its greatest diameter using computerized tomography (CT). Follow-up time was until death or one year after the stroke. Those who lived longer than one year after were subclassified according to the Rankin scale as < 3 and > or = 3. There was a significant difference between those who survived for less than one month and those surviving more than one year: their age (p < 0.01), average score on the scale (p < 0.001) and size of infarct (p < 0.05) or haematoma (p < 0.001). The Rankin subgroups < 3 and > or = 3 also differed significantly with regard to age. Noteworthy were the unfavourable data: Glasgow < 10 points and Canadian < 5 points, in infarcts > 6 cm and haematomas > 4 cm in diameter. We comment on other evolutionary variables which may influence prognostic assessment such as clinical deterioration or CT sensitivity of the infarct depending on the carry-out time.
