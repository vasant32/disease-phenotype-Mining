The goal of our study was whether free radicals contribute to the pathogenesis of the lacunar stroke to investigate the day after hospitalization, the concentrations of 3-nitrotyrosine and tyrosine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living patients. The subjects included 20 living patients with lacunar stroke and 20 controls. The NIH stroke scale score was used to assess the severity of the stroke, including that the patients were mild cases. There was no expansion of the infarct lesion in the brain, as assessed by CT on the day following admission. The concentration of 3-nitrotyrosine was significantly higher in patients with lacunar stroke. In contrast, the concentration of tyrosine did not differ between the two groups. Furthermore, the 3-nitrotyrosine/tyrosine ratio was significantly higher in patients with lacunar stroke than in controls. Our results show that free radicals are produced in the CSF of lacunar stroke patients and that nitration of neuronal proteines is enhanced under this condition. These obsetvations suggest that lacunar stroke patients should be treated with edaravon, which is a free radical scavenger usually prescribed for cases of major strokes, as it will likely improve the prognosis of these patients.
