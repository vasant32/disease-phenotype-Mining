The capacity of erythrocytes to deformation was examined in patients with acute disturbances of the cerebral circulation. It was shown that in patients with transient cerebral circulation disturbances and brain infarctions this capacity of erythrocytes was sharply lowered. It was accompanied by a greater capacity of erythrocytes to aggregation and by a lability of weakly linked proteins of the erythrocytic membranes. It was also shown that in patients with brain infarction the lipid fraction of the erythrocytic membranes was more viscous.
