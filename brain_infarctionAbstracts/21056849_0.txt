 RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether baseline apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps can be employed to predict both infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes in acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An automated image analysis system based on baseline ADC maps was tested against 30 patients with acute ischemic stroke of anterior circulation to predict both infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes. The predicted infarct core and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue were quantitatively and qualitatively compared with follow-up imaging data in recanalization and no recanalization groups, respectively. Direct comparisons with perfusion- and diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging measures were also made. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Spearman rank correlation, and Bland-Altman plots were performed. RESULTS: In the recanalization group, the predicted infarct core volume was significantly correlated with the final infarct volume (r = 0. 868, P < .001). In the no recanalization group, the predicted final infarct volume (sum of the predicted infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes), as well as the predicted salvageable ischemic tissue volume, was also significantly correlated with the true final infarct volume (r = 0.955, P < .001) and infarct growth (r = 0.918, P < .001), respectively. The volumes of perfusion-diffusion mismatch were significantly larger than those of infarct growth and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue. Good agreement between predicted and true final infarct lesions was visualized by Bland-Altman plots in two groups. Direct visual comparative analysis revealed good qualitative agreement between the true final infarct and predicted lesions in 21 patients. CONCLUSION: The proposed ADC based approach may be a feasible and practical tool to predict the volumes of infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue without intravenous contrast media-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging at baseline.
