We investigated whether the integrity of the corticospinal tract classified by diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) can predict the motor outcome in 25 patients with pontine infarct. DTTs were obtained in the early stage of stroke (5-30 days) and were classified into two groups (type A: the integrity of corticospinal tract was preserved around the infarct; type B: corticospinal tract was interrupted). DTT type A patients showed better motor function than the type B patients at 6 months after onset. DTT obtained at the early stage of pontine infarct appears to have predictive value for motor outcome in patients with pontine infarct.
