BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Silent brain infarctions (SBI) are common findings in advanced age, but their relationship to dementia is still uncertain. The present study was designed to evaluate whether SBI predict the development of dementia after first clinical ischemic stroke. METHODS: We blindly studied admission CT scans of 175 consecutive nondemented patients presenting with ischemic stroke that clinically was their first stroke episode. SBI were defined as CT evidence of infarcts not compatible with the acute event. The patients were subsequently followed for their mental state for 5 years. Survival analysis, wherein onset of dementia was the end point, was performed on the total sample population and conducted separately on those with and without SBI at admission. RESULTS: Dementia developed in 56 patients (32%), including 22 of the 63 (35%) with SBI and 34 of the 112 (30%) without SBI. Thus, dementia was not related to SBI. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that SBI do not predict the development of dementia after stroke.
