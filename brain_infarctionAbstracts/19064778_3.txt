CADASIL is an early onset small vessel disease and genetic variant of pure subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD). The condition has been invaluable in defining the profile and neuroimaging correlates of cognitive deficits in pure SIVD. The recent completion of a randomized trial in cognitively impaired CADASIL patients has illustrated the feasibility of targeted therapeutic trials in narrowly defined subtypes of vascular cognitive impairment. This article highlights some of the advances on cognition in CADASIL.
