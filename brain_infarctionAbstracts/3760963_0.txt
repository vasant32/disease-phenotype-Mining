In 41 anesthetized, spontaneously breathing male adult albino rats, cerebral hypotension of precisely defined duration and magnitude was induced by means of controlled arterial hemorrhage. One common carotid artery was occluded throughout the hypotensive period, and the target pressure was monitored in the ipsilateral internal carotid artery. Regional brain infarcts developed in all 16 animals with a target pressure of 14 mm Hg maintained for 90 minutes and in all five animals with a target pressure of 12 mm Hg maintained for 70 minutes. However, the brains of all 10 rats with a target pressure of 17 mm Hg maintained for 80 minutes remained intact. In two further groups of five animals each with target pressures of 15 mm Hg for 80 minutes and 16 mm Hg for 90 minutes the incidence of infarct was about 30%. There were no marked differences between the five groups of rats in body weight, body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, PaO2, PaCO2, arterial pH, or hematocrit. The data suggest that, in the rat, the clear-cut threshold for the induction of brain infarcts is a function of the severity and duration of arterial hypotension. Evidence is presented indicating that this function is distinctly species-dependent, due to species differences in the dilatory capacity of the arteries supplying the brain rather than species differences in brain vulnerability.
