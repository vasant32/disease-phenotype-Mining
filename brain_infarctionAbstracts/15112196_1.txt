BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to report on a patient who had occipital infarction from intradialytic hypotension and review the literature on hemodialysis and visual loss. METHODS: Neuro-ophthalmologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain were conducted. RESULTS: A 61-year-old woman had acute onset of a right homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defect during dialysis after several episodes of transient visual loss associated with symptomatic intradialytic hypotension. MRI showed acute infarction in the left occipital lobe. CONCLUSION: Visual loss is an uncommon complication of hemodialysis. The mechanism usually is related to hypotension and is usually from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Although cortical blindness secondary to stroke has been reported as a complication after hemodialysis, we were unable to find another report of visual loss secondary to stroke attributed to intradialytic hypotension with preceding episodes of transient visual loss. Transient visual loss may be a risk factor for stroke during hemodialysis.
