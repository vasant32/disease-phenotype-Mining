Two cases of pontine infarct with Wallerian degeneration (WD) of the pontocerebellar fibers are described. WD of pontocerebellar fibers, seen bilaterally along the transverse pontine fibers, is more visible in the middle cerebellar peduncles and extends into the white matter of the cerebellar hemispheres. Understanding the anatomy of the white matter and the temporal evolution of this degeneration is essential in identifying WD.
