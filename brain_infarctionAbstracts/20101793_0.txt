There are presently reports on elevated levels of cardiac troponins in patients without acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The objective of this investigation was to study the diagnostic value of increased blood cardiac troponin T levels in patients without its clinical picture and ECG changes characteristic of AMI. The study covered 72 patients (48 males and 24 females) aged 54 to 87 years (mean 69.8 +/- 11.2 years). The inclusion criteria were increased cardiac troponin T; the main exclusion criteria were AMI-typical anginal pain and characteristic ECG changes (ST-segment elevation, the appearance of pathological Q waves). The final diagnosis of AMI was established in only 29 (40.3%) patients; the other 43 patients were diagnosed as having the following diseases: septic state in 21; oncopathology in 10; diabetic nephropathy with chronic renal failure in 6; brain infarct in 4; and B12 deficiency anemia in 2. In dead patients, the level of troponin T was significantly higher than that in discharged patients, respective of the underlying disease. There was a direct correlation between the cardiac troponin T levels and the SAPS II index that reflected the severity of a patient's general condition (r = 0.44; p = 0.0001) and an inverse correlation between the cardiac troponin level and the left ventricular ejection fraction (r = -0.45; p = 0.003). Thus, despite the cardiospecificity of troponin T, its detection in the blood of critically ill patients without other manifestations of AMI is not a specific symptom of AMI, but it is suggestive of the severity of the disease, probably with the involvement of the myocardium into the pathological process.
