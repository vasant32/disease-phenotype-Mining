Extinction of conditioned eyeblink responses (CRs) was analyzed in sixteen patients with pure cortical cerebellar degeneration, 14 patients with lesions within the territory of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA), 13 patients with infarctions within the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and 45 age-matched controls. Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance (MRI) data sets were acquired in patients with focal lesions to identify affected cerebellar lobules and possible involvement of nuclei. Eyeblink conditioning was performed using a standard delay protocol. At the end of the experiment 10 CS-alone trials were presented as extinction trials. Controls showed significant effects of extinction that is a significant decline comparing CR-incidences in the extinction trials and the last block of 10 trials of the paired trials. In the group of all cerebellar patients, however, no significant effects of extinction were observed. In patients with unilateral lesions effects of extinction were present on the unaffected, but not on the affected side. Deficits of extinction were observed in PICA and SCA patients both with and without involvement of cerebellar nuclei. Extending previous reports in cerebellar patients the present findings show that the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere contributes to extinction of conditioned eyeblink responses in humans. It cannot be ruled out, however, that impaired acquisition affected the extinction results.
