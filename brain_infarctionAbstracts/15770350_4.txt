There is a potential risk of sacrificing the cortical vein during neurosurgical operations, particularly in the interhemispheric or subtemporal approach. An impaired cortical vein might cause cerebral venous circulatory disturbances (CVCDs) resulting in venous infarction. In this article, we have reviewed the management and results of eight cases with symptomatic postoperative venous infarction. We have encountered eight cases with symptomatic postoperative venous infarction (0.3%) during the past 5 years. The series is composed of 3 males and 5 females, with ages that ranged from 43 to 76 years (mean age of 58.1 years), and consisted of five brain tumors, one cavernoma, one dural AVF, and one trigeminal neuralgia. Initial symptoms occurred intra-operatively in two, on 0 day after the operation in one, 1 day in three, 3 days in one, and 4 days in one case. The symptoms were intra-operative brain edema in two cases, disorientation in one, cerebellar signs in one, hemiparesis in one, aphasia in two, and headache in one case. Two cases required surgical intervention. The results were a good outcome in 6 and a fair outcome in 2 cases. In conclusion, there are two types of postoperative venous infarction; severe onset (severe type) and gradual onset (mild type). The former needs immediate treatment from the intra-operative period onward, and the prevention of the ongoing venous thrombosis is essential in the latter.
