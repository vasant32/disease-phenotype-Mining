 STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: To present and discuss the case of a patient who sustained a significant flexion compression injury of the cervical spine with resulting tetraplegia and development of cortical blindness. SETTING: National Spinal Injuries Unit and Institute of Neurological Sciences, Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, Scotland, UK. METHODS: Clinical and radiological follow-up of the patient. RESULTS: Cortical blindness resulted from vertebral artery dissection associated with blunt cervical spine trauma. The patient is registered blind and is ventilator dependent. CONCLUSION: The potential complications of blunt vertebral artery injury remain poorly recognised. Screening is routinely not performed. Advances in noninvasive radiological techniques may result in recognition of asymptomatic disease and the potential for therapeutic intervention.
