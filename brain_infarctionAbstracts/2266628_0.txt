A 63-year-old woman was referred to our division because of massive hemoptysis (200 ml) after administration of ticlopidine, an anti-thrombotic drug, for prevention of recurrent brain infarction. Ticlopidine treatment was stopped on the first hospital day, thereafter the patient's hemoptysis immediately disappeared. A chest roentgenogram and broncho-fiberscopic examination did not reveal any organic lesion associated with hemoptysis. Laboratory data revealed prolonged bleeding time and decreased platelet aggregation, suggesting that the patient had had a hemorrhagic diathesis associated with the administration of ticlopidine. Although many anti-thrombotic drugs have been recently employed in a variety of clinical cases, the patient's hemoptysis was considered to be due to side effects.
