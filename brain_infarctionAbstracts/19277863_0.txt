In order to evaluate the functional role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in cerebral ischemia, both multidrug resistance 1a knockout (KO) mice and wild-type mice were subjected to transient focal ischemia under a constant body and brain temperature about 37 degrees C. The results showed that the volume of brain infarction induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in KO mice was significantly smaller than that seen in wild-type mice, although there were no significant differences in cerebral blood flow, physiological data and on anatomical analysis of cerebrovasculature between both groups. We suggest that multidrug resistance 1a P-gp plays a role for adjusting the expressions of endogenous neuronal cell modulating substances, such as cytokines, neuronal peptides, and others, in the brain, which is consistent with a previous paper (Bobrov et al. Neurosci Lett 24: 6-11, 2008).
