Lemierre's syndrome is an oropharyngeal infection which leads to severe septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and metastatic abscesses of the lungs and other organs. It is usually caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, a Gram-negative obligate anaerobe. An unusual case of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-producing Staphylococcus aureus infection masquerading as Lemierre's syndrome is reported here. A 32-year-old fit and otherwise healthy male presented on Christmas morning with a boil on his left cheek for 2 days and generalized rash for 3 h. His general condition began to worsen, he developed facial swelling and loss of vision in the left eye and was transferred to the intensive care unit. His treatment was taken over by team of specialists and further investigations revealed thrombophlebitis of the left internal jugular vein and cavernous sinus thrombosis with multiple brain infarcts and lung abscesses. His condition remained critical with multiple cranial nerve involvement despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures grew S. aureus which was producing PVL toxin. He improved gradually over several weeks. He underwent intensive physiotherapy and made a good recovery. Although a rare entity, it is important to consider Lemierre's syndrome in septic patients who present with rapidly worsening symptoms.
