OBJECTIVES: To evaluate safety of early carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with acute brain ischemia presenting to the emergency department stroke units (EDSU). METHODS: The neurologists, neuroradiologists and vascular surgeons on duty in emergency departments enrolled 96 patients who underwent very early CEA according to a predefined protocol within two years. The protocol included evaluation of neurological status by National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), neuroimaging assessment, ultrasound of the carotid arteries and Transcranial Doppler. Patients with NIHSS>22 or whose neuroimaging showed brain infarct >2/3 of the middle cerebral artery territory were excluded. All eligible patients underwent CEA as soon as possible. Primary end points of the study were mortality, neurological morbidity by NIHSS and postoperative hemorrhagic conversion on neuroimaging. Statistical analysis was performed by univariate analysis. RESULTS: The mean time elapsing between the onset of stroke and endarterectomy was 1.5 days (+/-2 days). The overall 30-day morbidity mortality rate was 7.3% (7/96). No neurological mortality occurred. On hospital discharge, three patients (3%) experienced worsening of the neurological deficit (NIHSS score 1 to 2, 1 to 3 and 9 to 10 respectively). Postoperative CT demonstrated there were no new cerebral infarcts nor hemorrhagic transformation. At hospital discharge 9/96 patients (9%) had no improvement in NHISS scores, 37 were asymptomatic and 45 showed a median decrease of 4.5 NIHSS points (range 1-18). By univariate analysis none of the considered variables influenced the clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: Our protocol selected patients who can safely undergo very early (<1.5 days) surgery after acute brain ischemia. Large randomized multicenter prospective trials are warranted to compare very early CEA versus best medical therapy.
