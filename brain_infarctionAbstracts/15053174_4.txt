PURPOSE: To report magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings of wallerian degeneration of the pontocerebellar tract secondary to a pontine infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cranial MR images obtained during the past seven years in our institution and selected those from patients with a chronic stage of pontine infarction and a hyperintense lesion at the central portion of the middle cerebellar peduncle on T2-weighted images. RESULTS: In three patients with a ventromedial pontine infarction, we found a symmetrical hyperintense lesion at the central portion of the middle cerebellar peduncle bilaterally on T2-weighted MR images in the chronic stage. In another patient with a ventrolateral pontine infarction, we found such a lesion at the ipsilateral middle cerebellar peduncle. CONCLUSION: Because the middle cerebellar peduncle carries afferent fibers from the contralateral basis pontis to the cerebellar cortex, these middle cerebellar peduncular lesions are regarded as wallerian degeneration. This secondary degeneration should not be misinterpreted as a newly developed infarction or other disease.
