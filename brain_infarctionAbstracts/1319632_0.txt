Overall 30 patients who suffered ischemic brain stroke were examined for cerebral and central hemodynamics by radiocerebrography (RC) with the aid of the radiopharmaceutical preparation Tx-99 and by radiocardiography (RCG) using 131I. These methods were employed simultaneously with computer-aided tomography, cerebral angiography, rheoencephalography. The control group was made up of 18 patients suffering from peripheral nervous diseases. In 11 patients with a favourable outcome of ischemic brain stroke and the recovery of work fitness, the RC and RCG readings did not practically differ from those in the controls. The remaining 19 patients with disability due to brain stroke demonstrated deceleration of the cerebral blood flow, most pronounced on the side of brain infarction. Asymmetry of the cerebral blood flow and deceleration of blood supply in the main and intracerebral vessels as shown by the RC readings turned out the signs of the hemodynamically significant stenosis of one of the internal carotid arteries, even in lack of the changes on the angiogram. A correlation was established between deterioration of central hemodynamics and deceleration of the cerebral blood flow, as was a possibility of an increase of the blood inflow to the brain after administering drugs that make the RCG readings return to normal.
