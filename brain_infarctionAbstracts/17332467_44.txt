BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2), is a major factor driving leukocyte infiltration into the brain parenchyma in a variety of neuropathologic conditions associated with inflammation, including stroke. In addition, recent studies indicate that CCL2 and its receptor (CCR2) could have an important role in regulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. This study evaluated the role of the CCL2/CCR2 axis in regulating postischemic inflammation, BBB breakdown, and vasogenic edema formation. METHODS: CCR2(-/-) and CCR2(+/+) mice were subjected to focal transient cerebral ischemia. BBB permeability and brain edema formation were observed at days 1 and 5 of reperfusion by evaluating the product surface area for fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin and measuring water and electrolyte contents. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess leukocyte infiltration. cDNA gene and protein arrays for inflammatory cytokines were used to assess inflammatory profiles in CCR2(+/+) and CCR2(-/-) mice. RESULTS: CCR2(-/-) mice had reduced infarct sizes and significantly reduced BBB permeability and brain edema formation in the affected ischemic hemisphere compared with CCR2(+/+) mice. This reduction in injury was closely associated with reduced infiltration of not only monocytes but also neutrophils (7- and 4-fold decreases, respectively). In addition, CCR2(-/-) mice had reduced expression/production of inflammatory cytokines during reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that inhibiting the CCL2/CCR2 axis affects brain reperfusion outcome by reducing brain edema, leukocyte infiltration, and inflammatory mediator expression.
