BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline is one of the clinical hallmarks of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a cerebrovascular disease caused by NOTCH3 mutations. In this 7-year follow-up study, we aimed to determine whether there are associations between the different radiologic hallmarks in CADASIL and decline in specific cognitive domains. METHODS: Twenty-five NOTCH3 mutation carriers and 13 controls had standardized neuropsychological testing and MRI examinations at baseline and after a follow-up of 7 years. To identify longitudinal associations between MRI abnormalities and cognitive decline, correlation analysis was used. RESULTS: At follow-up, mutation carriers showed a decline in global cognitive function (CAMCOG, p < 0.01) and in the cognitive domains language, memory, and executive function, compared to controls. Cognitive decline, especially executive dysfunction, was associated with increase in lacunar infarcts, microbleeds, and ventricular volume. In contrast, WMHs and brain atrophy were not associated with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Increase in lacunar infarcts, microbleeds, and ventricular volume, but not white matter lesions or atrophy, are associated with cognitive decline in the process of CADASIL in younger-aged, mildly affected patients with CADASIL.
