Spontaneous magnetic slow wave brain activity can be used to locate the underlying sources with sufficient accuracy by using the single current dipole model. To locate focal sources from spontaneous activity a tool had to be developed to extract focal densities of dipoles across time-the dipole density plot. The first version works on discrete volume units and is used for screening. The second version avoids a possible localization error and works continuously and this even is done on individual slices. The DDP seems to be a valuable tool for extracting and separating different focal sources from the background activity. Not only brain infarctions and haemorrhages (and cysts and angiomas) could be located, but also functional sources associated with TIAs even one week after the symptoms. First results let us assume that clinically silent TIAs also (in analogy to clinically silent brain infarctions) could be detected and located.
