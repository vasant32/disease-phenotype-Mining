Two aged women suddenly suffered from severe cervical and back pain followed by ipsilateral hemiparesis sparing the face. One woman had taken anticoagulant for prosthetic mitral valve and another had taken antiplatelet for prevention of recurrent brain infarction. On admission, MRI did not document any definite lesions in the brain, and revealed epidural hematoma compressing the cervical spinal cord for both patients. We promptly stopped their anticoagulants and antiplatelets use, because the agents seemed to be the leading cause of hematoma. In addition, we performed emergent laminectomy and evacuation of hematoma for the former patient. These cases suggest dual warnings against recently prevalent antithrombotic therapy for patients with histories of thromboembolic accidents. First, we should be careful about spinal epidural hematoma as a hemorrhagic complication of antithrombotic therapy. Second, we should not misdiagnose spinal epidural hematoma as ischemic stroke nor select hyperacute thrombolytic therapy. Cervical pain and hemiparesis sparing face are important signs for distinction of spinal epidural hematoma from stroke.
