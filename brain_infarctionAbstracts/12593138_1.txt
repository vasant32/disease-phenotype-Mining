Meningovascular syphilis is now quite uncommon, but there have been increasing reports in patients immunocompromised with human immunodeficiency virus. The response of syphilis affecting the central nervous system to antibiotic therapy remains a challenge. This is an even greater challenge in patients who have underlying compromise of the immune system. The authors present a 46-year-old male with recurrent stroke who was found to have cerebrospinal fluid compatible with syphilitic involvement of the central nervous system and a cerebral arteriogram, which revealed focal narrowing of the right middle cerebral artery. The baseline transcranial Doppler study demonstrated increased mean and peak flow velocity within the right middle cerebral artery. Despite a 10-day course of intravenous penicillin, with substantial improvement in the cerebrospinal fluid results, this flow velocity elevation persisted, in a remarkably consistent pattern, over a 4-month follow-up period. Thus, the involved vessel remained patent following treatment, but no clear resolution of the stenotic lesion was observed.
