Data of literature on the role of inflammation factors in the pathogenesis of stroke are presented. The study of myeloperoxidase level in the early acute phase of ischemic stroke and dynamics of this parameter after the antioxidant treatment with the α-lipoic acid preparation berlition was carried out. It has been shown that the activation of systemic inflammation and related oxidative stress recorded in the early acute phase of brain infarction needs pharmacological treatment. Neuroprotective action of α-lipoic acid related to the prevention of damaging effect of free radicals on cell membranes and reduction of oxidative stress intensity is a pathogenetic explanation for using its preparations in ischemic brain lesions. The decrease in plasma myeloperoxidase content after the treatment with berlition may consider as a criterion of its efficacy.
