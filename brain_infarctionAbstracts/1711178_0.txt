Brains of the deceased in the age from 45 to 57 years (6 cases) and from 80 to 101 years (9 cases) with ischemic brain damage were studied. Technique of the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (Sterberger et al. 1970) was used for visualization of the brain tissue reactivity for albumin, IgG, alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin. In all cases the disturbances of the blood vessels permeability were found. The BBB deterioration within the first days of brain infarct seems to be smaller in senile age than in middle age. However, after some days senile blood vessels permeability increases and become similar in both age groups.
