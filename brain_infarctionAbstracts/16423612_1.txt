Neonates (n = 20) treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were evaluated with serial amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG). There was no acute change in aEEG during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulation, nor were there lateralizing effects. An abnormal aEEG predicted death or moderate to severe intracranial neuropathology with sensitivity = 1.0, specificity = 0.75, positive predictive value = 0.86, and negative predictive value = 1.0.
