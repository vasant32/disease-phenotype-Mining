 PURPOSE: To evaluate visual field loss using multifocal ERG(m-ERG), multifocal VEP(m-VEP), and Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter(HRF) in a patient with branch retinal artery occlusion(BRAO) and brain infarction. CASE: A 38-year-old man noticed inferior-nasal visual field loss in the left eye, and was referred to Keio University Hospital. He suffered from paralysis in the left leg due to brain infarction at the age of 24. However, he had not noticed visual field loss due to the brain infarction. His left fundus showed retinal edema in the area of a superior-temporal retinal artery occulusion. He was diagnosed as having BRAO. The Goldmann and Humphry perimetric examinations revealed homonymous quadrantanopia in the upper left field as well as inferior visual field defect in the left eye. RESULTS: Both m-ERG and m-VEP, especially second-kernel responses, were reduced in the affected retinal area of BRAO. But only m-VEP was affected in the corresponding area of homonymous quadrantanopia in the upper left field. The retinal flow in the area with BRAO evaluated by HRF was decreased in some areas and not in others, suggesting that retinal function was not necessarily consistent with retinal circulation. CONCLUSIONS: m-ERG and m-VEP are useful To differentiate retinal lesions from brain lesions in visual field loss.
