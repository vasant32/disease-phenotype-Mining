BACKGROUND: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been associated with cryptogenic stroke in young patients. CLINICAL CASE: A 27-year-old man presented with acute confusional syndrome, altered language, bradypsychia and somnolence. Brain MRI showed symmetrical bilateral thalamic infarctions probably due to occlusion of Percheron's artery type 2b. Echocardiography showed patent foramen ovale. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebrovascular disease is a frequent cause of disability and even death in young patients, and thus its medical approach should be emphasized.
