The role of repeat resection in the multimodal treatment of gliomas is unclear. Repeat surgery theoretically carries a higher risk of inducing neurological deficits, which might even out any advantage of cytoreduction. We sought to determine whether the occurrence of perioperative infarction is higher for repeat surgery than for first surgery, and sought to identify factors associated with the occurrence of postoperative infarction. Therefore, we searched our database to identify patients who were operated for primary or recurrent glial tumors between October 2007 and October 2010. We analyzed 177 procedures, of which 130 (73.4%) were first surgeries and 47 (26.5%) were repeat. Initial WHO grades, KPS scores, and age were evenly distributed between the groups. Forty-six (26.0%) patients had new DWI lesions on their postoperative MRI scan. Eighteen (10.2%) patients had new lesions greater than 4 cm(3). Among these were 11 (6.2%) patients, for whom the new lesion caused neurologic deficit. There was no difference between first and repeat surgery with regard to the occurrence of new DWI lesions (27.7 vs. 21.3%, P = 0.77) or neurological deficits (10.0 vs. 10.6%, P = 1.0). Tumor location in the insula, operculum, and temporal lobe was found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of new DWI lesions. We conclude that repeat surgery should not be withheld as a treatment option for patients with recurrent gliomas for fear of a higher risk of postoperative infarction or new neurologic deficit than the first surgery.
