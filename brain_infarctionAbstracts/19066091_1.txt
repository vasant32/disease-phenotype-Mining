Free radical scavengers have been shown to improve short-term outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether melatonin (a potent free radical scavenger and an indirect antioxidant) can improve short- and/or long-term neurological function after ICH, which was induced by collagenase injection into the striatum of adult rats. Melatonin (15 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 1, 24, 48, and 72 h. Neurological and behavioral testing was performed at several time points from 1 day to 8 weeks post-ICH. Neurological and behavioral deficits were observed in ICH rats at all time points, but the melatonin treatment regimen did not improve performance or level of brain injury.
