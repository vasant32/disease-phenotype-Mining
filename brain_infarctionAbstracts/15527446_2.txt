OBJECTIVES: Patients with lacunar infarcts (LI) and ipsilateral large artery disease (LAD) greater than 50% must be classified according to the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria as strokes of undetermined etiology. The purpose of this study was to compare the vascular risk factors, clinical symptoms, and outcome characteristics of LI associated with LAD with those patients with LI who fulfilled the TOAST criteria of small artery disease (SAD). METHODS: Among 1754 consecutive first ever stroke patients admitted to our department, we analyzed age, gender, vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, arterial peripheral disease, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use), clinical data (motor or sensitive deficit and presence of dysarthria), and outcome (hospitalization length, in-hospital medical complications rate, need of rehabilitation, treatment at discharge, in-hospital mortality, and modified Rankin Scale at discharge) of those patients classified as LI associated with LAD as compared with those with SAD. RESULTS: After a strict application of the TOAST criteria, we found 144 patients with LI associated with SAD and 73 patients with LI associated with LAD. Univariate analysis showed statistical differences in gender (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.23-0.89; P = 0.014), past history of ischemic heart disease (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.13-0.78; P = 0.004), and smoking (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.31-1.04; P = 0.048). After logistic regression analysis only ischemic heart disease (OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.11-0.78; P = 0.013), and gender (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.28-0.98; P = 0.05) showed statistical differences. During the follow-up, six patients (all with LI associated with LAD) experienced stroke recurrences (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.26-0.39; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 1) There are no differences in clinical presentation and in-hospital outcome between patients with LI associated with SAD and patients with LI associated with LAD. 2) Risk factors are very similar in both groups, and the only differences observed (gender and ischemic heart disease) are related to the atherosclerotic factor. 3) Stroke recurrence seems to be more frequent in LI associated with LAD than in LI associated with SAD, but large follow-up studies are needed to be able to decide whether clinical recurrence of stroke allows to differentiate both clinical entities.
