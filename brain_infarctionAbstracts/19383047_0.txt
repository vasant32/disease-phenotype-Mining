 RATIONALE: Lacunar infarct associated with small vessel disease is a common stroke subtype in China and has a favorable short-term prognosis. Data on its long-term prognosis among Chinese patients are lacking. AIMS: We aimed to study its long-term prognosis and predictors for poor outcomes. DESIGN: We followed up to 75 consecutive Chinese stroke patients who had a lacunar infarct for a period of 5 years. Clinical outcomes with respect to mortality and recurrent stroke were noted. We evaluated baseline clinical and imaging predictors for such outcomes using the Cox regression analysis. STUDY OUTCOMES: Sixteen (21.3%) patients died and 12 (16%) patients had recurrent stroke during follow-up. Twenty-one (28%) patients had combined events of either death and/or recurrent stroke. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that age, literacy, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, incident stroke/transient ischemic attack, and white matter lesion volume predicted survival, while, age, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, systolic blood pressure, hyperhomocysteinemia, silent lacunes, microbleeds, and white matter lesion volume predicted recurrent stroke. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.48) and white matter lesion volume (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.11-1.92) predicted combined events of mortality and/or recurrent stroke after age adjustment. CONCLUSION: Approximately one in four patients either died and/or had recurrent stroke within 5 years after a lacunar infarct. Age, stroke severity, and volume of white matter lesion predict a poor long-term prognosis.
