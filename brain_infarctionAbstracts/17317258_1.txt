A 10-year-old female neutered domestic shorthair (DSH) cat and a 6-year-old female neutered Siamese cat were presented following a peracute onset of decerebellate rigidity and a cerebellar vestibular syndrome, respectively. In both cats, physical examination and routine blood tests were unremarkable, as was routine analysis of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from the DSH cat. Based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features - focal wedge-shaped lesion in the cerebellum characterised by hyperintensity in T2-weighted, T2( *)-gradient echo and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images - a presumptive diagnosis of cerebellar infarct was made in both cases. In the DSH cat, the post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of cerebellar infarct and additionally found acute renal infarcts and a pulmonary neoplasia. In the Siamese cat, ultrasonographic evaluation of the heart revealed a probable low-grade chronic valvular endocarditis which was thought to be a potential source of thromboembolism. This paper describes the first two cases - one confirmed and the other suspected - of cerebellar infarct in the cat. The in vivo potential diagnostic value of the MRI study is highlighted. Cerebellar infarcts should be included in the differential diagnosis of cat with a peracute onset of cerebellar signs regardless of the severity of neurological deficits.
