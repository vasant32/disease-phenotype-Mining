The purpose of this study was to demonstrate T1rho dispersion in different rat tissues (liver, brain, spleen, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle), and to compare the 1/T1rho data to previous 1/T1 data and magnetization transfer of rat tissues at low (0.1 T) B0 field. The 1/T1rho dispersion showed a fairly similar pattern in all tissues. The highest 1/T1rho relaxation rates were seen in liver and muscle followed by heart, whereas the values for spleen, kidney, and brain were quite similar. Compared to 1/T2 relaxation rate, the greatest difference was seen in liver and muscle. The rank order 1/T1rho value at each locking field B1 was the same as the transfer rate of magnetization from the water to the macromolecular pool (Rwm) for liver, muscle, heart, and brain. The potential value T1rho imaging is to combine high T1 contrast of low field imaging with the high signal to noise ratio of high static field imaging. When the T1rho value for a given tissue is known, the contrast between different tissues can be optimized by adjusting the locking time TL. Further studies are encouraged to fully exploit this. Targets for more detailed research include brain infarct, brain and liver tumors.
