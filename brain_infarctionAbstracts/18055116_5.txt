Our aim was to investigate caspase-3 plasma levels after stroke, its correlation with infarct expansion and neurological outcome. Caspase-3 plasma levels were determined by ELISA at different time points after stroke in 116 t-PA-treated patients and a control group of 40 healthy controls. Neurological status was evaluated by NIHSS scores and functional outcome by modified Rankin Scale. To assess brain infarct growth, serial brain magnetic resonance imaging scans including diffusion- (DWI) and perfusion-weighted (PWI) images were performed in a subgroup of 58 patients. Plasma caspase-3 levels were higher in stroke patients versus the control group throughout the acute phase of stroke. Furthermore, caspase-3 level at 24h was associated with poorer short- and long-term neurological outcome and positively correlated with infarct growth assessed by diffusion-weighted images. Our data suggest that caspase-3 could be involved in recruitment of ischemic brain tissue being a marker of infarct growth.
