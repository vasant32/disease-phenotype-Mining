It is recently reported that among chronic renal dialysis patients myocardial infarction accounts 7.4% of all the cause of death in Japan. In order to improve the mortality of dialysis patients the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a major problem. We review previous reports and discuss about the treatment of IHD in dialysis patients. The collected data from the previous reports written about CABG in dialysis patients shows that the mortality of CABG is 7.8% (30/387), the probability of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) 8.6% (21/243), brain infarction 1.6% (4/243) and major infection 5.8% (14/243). 3-year and 5-year mortality rate after CABG is reported to be 69-80% and 48-56%, respectively. The result of CABG is excellent and shows that this procedure improves the mortality of dialysis patients with IHD. The procedural mortality of PTCA is 5.6% (8/143), the probability of PMI is 7% (10/143). Many reports shows the high probability of the recurrence of chest pain (60-86%). This procedure when performed in dialysis patients is incomplete because of the calcification of the coronary artery. Even among the dialysis patients it is preferable to perform CABG positively.
