EEGs from 16 patients with stroke in three different stages of evolution were recorded. EEG sources were calculated every 0.39 Hz by frequency domain VARETA. The main source was within the delta band in 2 out of 4 chronic patients, and in 67% of the patients in the acute or subacute stages when edema (cytotoxic or vasogenic) was present. Moreover, all patients showed abnormal activity in the theta band. Sources of abnormal activity in cortical or corticosubcortical infarcts were located in the cortex, surrounding the lesion. At the site of the infarct, a decrease of EEG power was observed. Sources of abnormal theta power coincided with edema and/or ischemic penumbra.
