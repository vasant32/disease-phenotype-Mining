In accordance with the clinical and coagulographic data on 172 patients with ischemic brain stroke (IBS), the authors developed a method of the use of some medicamentous agents (heparin, platelet inhibitors, fresh-frozen blood plasma, plasminogen activators, proteolytic enzymes), adapted to concrete characteristics of the coagulation status at different stages of brain infarction formation and permitting the rate of lethal outcomes to be reduced. In disseminated intravascular coagulation seen in patients with the gravest patterns of IBS, heparin may be indicated.
