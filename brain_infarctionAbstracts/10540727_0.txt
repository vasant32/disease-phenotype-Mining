The authors describe a patient with bilateral anterior cerebral artery (ACA) occlusion. CT and MRI revealed bilateral encephalomalacia in the regions supplied by Heubner arteries and/or by perforating branches of ACA. The patient presented mainly with frontal symptomatology resulting from caudate nuclei lesion. Frontal symptomatology due to caudate impairment is discussed in the sense of frontal-subcortical circuits: lateral orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate ones. We emphasise a similarity of behavioural and cognitive disorders in early Huntington's disease and in frontal lobe lesion.
