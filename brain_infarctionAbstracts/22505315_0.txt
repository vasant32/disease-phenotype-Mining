Lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV) is a sonographic finding in infancy with obscure etiology and variable diagnostic and prognostic significance. Ischemic infarct in the territory of the lenticulostriate vessels after mild head trauma is a rare pathology. There are no publications on LSV followed by ischemic infarct. We present the case of an 8-month-old boy who suffered mild head trauma and developed an ischemic brain infarct in the territory of preexisting LSV. It is speculated that LSV might be a predisposing factor for ischemic brain infarct after mild head trauma in infants.
