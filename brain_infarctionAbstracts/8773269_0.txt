Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in 24 adults with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and results were correlated with 24 admission and 16 follow-up CT examinations. 19 MRI studies and clinical outcome at a mean follow-up of 44 weeks. DSA was abnormal in 11 patients. Abnormal DSA was associated with advanced clinical stages of the Medical Research Council classification, admission CT with hydrocephalus or gyral cortical enhancement. MRI disclosed brain infarcts not seen on initial CT in 8 cases. Of seven patients who died, 4 had abnormal and 3 normal DSA. Among patients who survived, those with normal DSA had a better functional outcome by Karnofsky scores. During follow-up infarcts were evident in 16 patients. Abnormal DSA in relation to brain infarcts had a sensitivity of 0.56, specificity 0.75, positive predictive value 0.82 and negative predictive value 0.46. A single arteriogram does not predict the outcome in patients with TBM and its value is limited in the assessment of vascular complications of TBM. Angiography in TBM is justified only in specific clinical trials to assess new therapeutic modalities against infarcts.
