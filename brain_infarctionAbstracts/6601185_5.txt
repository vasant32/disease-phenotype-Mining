Carbon-11-labeled glucose was prepared photosynthetically using the green alga Scenedesmus obtusiusculus Chod. The carbohydrates were extracted from the cells with dilute HCI and the glucose was isolated and purified using high-performance liquid chromatography. The manipulations in the hot cell are described. Analysis of the material (gas liquid chromatography and HPLC) showed that the glucose obtained was radiochemically pure. The total incorporation of the 11CO2 added to the algae was 60-80%. The radiochemical yield of pure carrier-added glucose was approximately 25%, at 40 min after E.O.B. including the HPLC purification and sterile filtration. The C-11 glucose uptake in rat brain was compared with that of commercial D[U-14C]glucose, and preliminary PET studies with D-[11C]glucose in a patient with a brain infarct are presented.
