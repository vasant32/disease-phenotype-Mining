76 consecutive patients aged under 40 with ischaemic brain infarction verified by carotid angiography and/or serial brain scanning were studied. In at least 15 cases (20%) the onset of symptoms was preceded within 24 hours by a bout of alcohol drinking. Ethanol-related cases comprised 40%, 25%, and 13% of the patients in the age-groups 16-19, 20-29, and 30-39 years, respectively. Ethanol intoxication preceding the stroke was 2-3 times as common in male and 3-4 times as common in female patients as ethanol intoxication in the general Finnish population of the same ages and sex. Occasional ethanol intoxication seems to carry an increased risk of ischaemic brain infarction in young adults.
