The therapeutic hemodynamic effects of external counterpulsation(ECP) and medical routine therapy in elderly patients with brain infarction during convalescence were investigated by Transcranial Doppler (TCD). The results showed that hemodynamic parametres(Vp, Vm, DVp, DVm) and asymmetry of MCA in elderly patients with brain infarction who were treated with ECP have improved significantly(P < 0.001), but that of MCA in elderly patients with brain infarction who were treated with medical routine therapy have not significantly improved. Therapeutic hemodynamic effects of ECP on elderly patients with brain infarction were much better than that of medical routine therapy(P < 0.001).
