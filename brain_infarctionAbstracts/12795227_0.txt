OBJECTIVE: To discuss clinical effects and therapeutic mechanisms of Tianbaokang Injection on ischemic apoplexy. METHODS: 70 cases of ischemic apoplexy were divided into two groups at random(Tianbaokang group and contrast group, 38 and 32 cases respectively). Clinical effects and indexes of hemorheology and vascular endothelial oxidative injury(SOD activity, MDA content, NO level and ET-1 concentration). RESULTS: The efficiency of Tianbaokang on ischemic apoplexy was 92.1%. Tianbaokang can improve indexes of hemorheology, decrease plasm MDA and ET-1 content, and increase SOD activity and NO level obviously. CONCLUSION: Tianbaokang has better effects on ischemic apoplexy. The therapeutic mechanisms may be related to improving hemorheology, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and vascular endothelial injury, and regulating endothelial function.
