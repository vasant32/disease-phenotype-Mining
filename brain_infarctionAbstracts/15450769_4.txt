The relationship between lesion location and quality of life (QOL) in stroke patients has not yet been clearly revealed. The present study was undertaken to investigate the clinical and anatomical correlates which can predict future QOL in stroke patients. The study subjects consisted of 69 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were followed up 2 months after the stroke event at the stroke unit. Quality of life was evaluated during the 2-month follow up period after the stroke. Baseline information or data including clinical and anatomical correlates (Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Barthel's Index, MRI data) at the time of the stroke event were collected by performing a review of each patient's chart and research data files. Severe subcortical gray matter lesion and depressive symptoms in the acute phase of stroke were of importance in predicting low QOL 2 months after stroke.
