The possible risk factors were evaluated in 249 patients with cerebral infarction and in the control group consisting of 190 subjects of the same age and sex distribution. The following factors were significantly associated with brain infarction: elevated blood pressure, cardiac abnormalities, elevated blood glucose content, abnormal glucose tolerance, elevated blood cholesterol and beta-lipoproteid content and hemoglobin level. It was concluded that at present the key to stroke prevention is the early detection and control of hypertension and cardiac activity impairment.
