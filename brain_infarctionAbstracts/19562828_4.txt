The association of intracranial hypotension syndrome with cerebral venous thrombosis is rare. We report our experience with isolated cortical venous thrombosis, which developed after unsuccessful epidural anesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed characteristic imaging findings of intracranial hypotension syndrome, such as dural thickening and brain sagging. We also detected right parietal venous hemorrhagic infarction secondary to right-sided cortical venous thrombosis. After the treatment of intracranial hypotension via epidural blood patch, heparin was used to treat cortical venous thrombosis.
