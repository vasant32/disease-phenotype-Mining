We investigated the clinical outcome and current therapeutic management of ischemic stroke in elderly patients in different neurological wards throughout Italy. Twelve centers in 10 Italian regions were involved. The clinical and instrumental data were prospectively collected for 335 patients 65 years or older, presenting in a 12-months period. At the multivariate analysis, death was associated with the presence of total anterior circulation infarct and the use of antiedema agents. Stroke-related disability was related to female sex, unified stroke scale (USS) scores at entry and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores at the 1-months follow-up. The majority of patients (70%) received antiplatelets to prevent stroke recurrence. Very elderly (> or =80 years) patients had worse presentation and prognosis than less elderly stroke victims (<80 years). Age played an important role in the therapeutic approach to stroke: while antiplatelets were widely used, oral anticoagulants were underused even when specifically indicated.
