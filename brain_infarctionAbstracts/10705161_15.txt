The neuropathological substrates of dementia and depression were evaluated in 30 patients with cerebrovascular disease and significant cognitive impairment (VaD), with a particular focus on patients with small infarct volumes (<15 ml). VaD patients with small infarct volumes had a similar degree of cognitive impairment to those with larger infarct volumes (>15 ml) but were significantly more likely to be depressed and to have areas of microinfarction. A review of individual cases with small infarct volumes suggested that the combination of microinfarction, diffuse white matter disease and perivascular changes, or the overlap of neurodegenerative pathologies and microvascular changes were particularly important. Microinfarction was also significantly associated with major depression.
