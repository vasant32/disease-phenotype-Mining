OBJECTIVE: The clinical course of acute stroke can be highly variable and for effective management outcome prediction needs to be refined. We investigated whether EEG parameters are of additional diagnostic and prognostic value in the early phase of acute ischemic anterior circulation stroke. METHODS: Ninety-four patients presenting with acute anterior circulation syndrome (ACS) of presumed ischemic origin were incrementally included. Clinical characteristics were correlated with volume of ischemia and EEG parameters. Predictive values for definite stroke, early neurological deterioration, spontaneous early neurological improvement and death within 1 week after ACS were calculated using ROC curves and logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: In patients with normal or near normal NIHSS score of 0 or 1, the pairwise derived brain symmetry index (pdBSI) was an independent predictor for definite stroke displaying an overall accuracy of 80%. Early neurological deterioration was independently predicted by pdBSI with a correct classification rate of 95%. In ROC analysis, death was predicted by pdBSI with overall accuracy of 97%. Spontaneous neurological improvement was independently predicted by the delta+theta/alpha+beta - ratio with overall accuracy of 75%. Small-vessel stroke was independently predicted by pdBSI with a correct classification rate of 92%. CONCLUSIONS: EEG may be of prognostic value for spontaneous neurological improvement, early neurological deterioration and death in the acute setting of acute anterior circulation syndrome of presumed ischemic origin. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings may have an impact on stroke care.
