BACKGROUND: A high incidence of thrombotic events in thalassemia intermedia (TI) patients led to the identification of a hypercoagulable state. Brain involvement has not been widely studied in TI, although limited reports confirm a low incidence of overt stroke and high incidence of silent brain infarcts. PATIENTS/METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted on 30 adult, splenectomized TI patients. Patients were screened for absence of neurological signs or symptoms, and stroke-related risk factors. Patient charts were reviewed for demographics, duration since splenectomy, and any history of transfusion therapy. Blood samples were obtained for complete blood counts and serum ferritin. Direct determination of liver iron concentration (LIC) was performed by R2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain MRI was performed on all patients, looking for ischemic lesions and/or atrophy. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 32.1 +/- 11 years (range, 18-54 years), with a male to female ratio of 13:17. Eighteen patients (60%) had evidence of one or more white matter lesions (WMLs) on brain MRI, all involving the subcortical white matter. Fourteen patients had evidence of multiple WMLs, with a mean of 5 +/- 10 lesions (range, 2 to > 40 lesions). The vast majority of patients (94%) had small (< 0.5 cm) to medium (0.5-1.5 cm) WMLs, with only one patient showing evidence of a large (> 1.5 cm) WML. Eleven patients (37%) had mild cerebral atrophy. On multivariate analysis only age and transfusion history were independently and significantly associated with the occurrence of zero, single or multiple WMLs. CONCLUSION: WMLs and brain atrophy are a common finding in adult, splenectomized, TI patients. Increasing age and transfusion naivety are associated with a higher incidence and multiplicity of lesions.
