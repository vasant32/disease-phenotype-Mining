A dynamic assessment of oxygen status of the arterial blood, activity of antioxidant system enzymes (AOS), succinatedehydrogenase (SDG), mitochondrial alpha-glycero-phosphate-dehydrogenase (alpha-GPDH) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) as well as concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) and secondary products of lipid peroxidation reacting with thiobarbituric acid (PLPRTA) has been carried out in patients at the acute stage of ischemic stroke of hemispheric location. Relative hyperoxia as a result of the hyperventilation syndrome was mostly pronounced on day 1 and 3. At the same time, a reduced activity of AOS system and an increase of PLPRTA concentration have been observed from the 1st day after stroke. There were also a decrease of the SDG activity and a marked (2,8 fold) increase of the alpha-GPDH activity as compared to the controls. A decrease of the AP leukocyte activity in the peripheral blood to day 7 after stroke makes possible a prognosis of good functional rehabilitation to the 21st day of the disease. Therefore, the results of the study suggest that the development of oxidative stress in patients with ischemic stroke is caused by tprimary disruption of bioenergetic processes during the reduction of AOS activity.
