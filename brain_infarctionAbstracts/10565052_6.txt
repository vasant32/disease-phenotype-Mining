Intracranial aneurysms associated with moyamoya disease are often reviewed. Aneurysms not around the circle of Willis but on the collateral vessels are rare. A 71-year-old woman presented with sudden onset of severe headache and vomiting. CT scan showed an intraventricular hemorrhage from bilateral lateral ventricle to fourth ventricle. Cerebral angiography showed the occlusion of the terminal portion of the bilateral internal carotid artery with moyamoya vessels and three aneurysms at the distal portion of the left lateral posterior choroidal artery. Clinical symptoms improved day by day, but 17 days later, due to rebleeding of the aneurysms the patient fell into coma. The day after rebleeding, endovascular embolization was performed using liquid particle, and the left lateral posterior choroidal artery and the aneurysm were occluded. Brain infarction with massive brain edema of the left cerebral hemisphere resulted in the patient's death. The management of the aneurysms in the basal ganglia and on the collateral vessels associated with moyamoya disease is controversial. We suggest positive intervention during the acute stage for the peripheral artery aneurysms taking endovascular embolization into consideration to prevent rupture or rebleeding.
