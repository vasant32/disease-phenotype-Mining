During the last 10 years, five children were treated at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles for acute, persistent neurologic loss during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Four were transferred from local hospitals after the neurologic crisis. Computed tomography (CT) studies showed one or more areas of brain infarction in each patient, and none had evidence of diffuse cerebral edema. As three of the five patients had been treated for cerebral edema before their CT, brain edema may have been present initially. Our findings emphasize the importance of brain infarction as a cause of persistent neurologic loss in children with DKA.
