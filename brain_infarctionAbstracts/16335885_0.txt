Antihypertensive therapy based on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril reduced the incidence of recurrent stroke in the Perindopril Protection against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS). The present study assessed the effect of perindopril on the 24-h blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with lacunar infarction using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). There was a 4-week observation period, a 4-week treatment period 1 (perindopril at 2 mg/day), and a 4-week treatment period 2 (perindopril at 4 mg/day). Twenty-seven hypertensive patients with lacunar infarction (10 dippers and 17 non-dippers) were enrolled. The average 24-h BP values were significantly decreased after both treatment periods. When the patients were divided into dippers and non-dippers, perindopril exhibited a different BP-lowering effect in the groups with these two circadian BP patterns. In dippers, daytime BP was significantly decreased, whereas nighttime BP was not, so an excessive fall of nighttime BP was not observed. In non-dippers, both daytime and nighttime BP were decreased, with a stronger BP-lowering effect at night. There was a significant inverse correlation between the magnitude of the change in nighttime BP and the night/day ratio. These results suggested that perindopril could induce a sustained decrease of the 24-h BP in patients with lacunar infarction. In particular, a more pronounced nighttime BP-lowering effect was observed in non-dippers. As the incidence of non-dippers is reported to be high among patients with cerebrovascular disease, better nighttime BP control by perindopril might have helped to improve the outcome of such patients in PROGRESS.
