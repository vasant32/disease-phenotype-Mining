OBJECTIVE: Silent or asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease is believed to be an important risk factor for symptomatic stroke and vascular dementia. Although non-specific complaints such as mild to moderate headache and/or dizziness may also be caused by silent stroke, which remains a topic of controversy. METHODS: To investigate the relationship between silent brain infarcts and non-specific complaints, we assessed findings on magnetic resonance images using a common protocol in the following three groups of subjects; Group 1:78 subjects with non-specific complaints, Group 2:47 subjects with vascular risk factors, and Group 3:75 normal subjects without any subjective complaints or vascular risk factors. In addition to silent stroke, deep white matter lesions on MRI were also evaluated. All subjects were recruited from 12 institutes of the study group located at various parts of Japan. RESULTS: Silent brain infarcts were demonstrated in 44%, 43%, and 20% of subjects in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In Group 1, the average number of infarcts per individual who had silent brain infarction was 1.8, which was significantly fewer than 3.8 in Group 2 or 3.5 in Group 3 (p<0.0167). White matter lesions were found in 68%, 49%, and 11% in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, indicating that non-specific complaints are more closely related to deep white matter lesions than to silent infarct lesions. Such white matter lesions were found more frequently in subjects with depressive state than in non-depressed subjects (67% vs. 39%, p=0.0155). CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that deep white matter lesions, rather than silent brain infarcts, appear to be important in producing headache and/or dizziness of non-specific cause and also to be related to the depressive state.
