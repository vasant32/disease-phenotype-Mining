BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral endothelial cells are quiescent under normal conditions; they are stimulated to proliferate around an infarct, although the mechanism is unclear. In the present study we explored the relation between angiogenesis and the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) by participating cells in brain infarct. METHODS: Brain infarct was created in rats by ligation of a branch of the left middle cerebral artery followed by permanent occlusion of the left common carotid artery and temporary occlusion of the right common carotid artery. The brains were removed after 1 to 14 days and studied with histological and immunohistochemical methods. Bromodeoxyuridine (BRdU) was used as an S-phase marker for the proliferative cells. RESULTS: Enhanced bFGF immunoreactivity was observed in neurons adjacent to the infarct after 1 day, and the change subsequently spread to distant neurons in the ipsilateral hemisphere. After 2 days blood vessels and glial cells around the infarct began to incorporate BRdU. During the first week new capillaries accompanied by macrophages extended into the infarct. The macrophages, endothelial cells, and reactive astrocytes expressed mild to moderate bFGF immunoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial and temporal correlation between bFGF expression and angiogenesis in conjunction with the well-known biological properties of bFGF suggest that bFGF produced by neurons, macrophages, and glial cells may participate in angiogenesis in brain infarct.
