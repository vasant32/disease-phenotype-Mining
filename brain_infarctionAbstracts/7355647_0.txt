On the basis of dynamic examinations of 52 patients with various forms of cerebrovascular disorders it has been found, that intravascular aggregation of platelets takes place in all forms of cerebral stroke (brain infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoidal hemorrhage) and in transitory disturbances of cerebral circulation. The intravascular aggregation of platelets and activation of the blood coagulation system are more marked in cases of cerebral hemorrhage, as compared with other forms of cerebral stroke. The degree of the platelet intravascular aggregation is directly proportional to the stroke gravity, the thromboembolic complications, and the progress of chronic cardiovascular insufficiency. The intravascular aggregation of platelets is considered to be one of the pathogenetic factors of cerebrovascular diseases.
