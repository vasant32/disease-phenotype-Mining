The aim of our study is to determine how early and reliably ischemic brain infarcts can be detected on CT scanning. We report two cases of an early CT finding of acute ischemic infarcts where CT examination was obtained within the first 3 hours of onset of neurological symptoms. CT examination showed blurred outlines and decreased attenuation of the left lentiform nucleus, loss of the white-gray matter interface in the left insular cortex and left cortical global hypoattenuation with obliteration of left cortical sulci in one patient. In second patient CT showed the following: hyperdense left middle cerebral artery, loss of clear margins of left lentiform nucleus, subtle focal cortical hypodensity in the left fronto-parietal area with signs of mass effect in the form of ventricular compression. CT is still the first choice in the deferential diagnosis of acute stroke. Although older literature positions have suggested that CT was negative during the first 48 hours, modern CT technology can demonstrate positive findings even in the first 3 hours of onset. This is important in patients with acute stroke, as thrombolytic therapy when elected, has to be given within the first 3-6 hours after onset of symptoms. To determine how early and reliably ischemic brain infarcts can be detected on CT scanning, we report two cases of an early CT finding of acute ischemic infarcts where CT examination was obtained within the first 3 hours of onset of neurological symptoms.
