Hypertension has not been strongly identified as a risk factor in childhood stroke. This report describes a case of a teenager with a lacunar stroke, the type often observed in adults with hypertensive-associated infarction, and masked hypertension. The patient had normal blood pressure on initial presentation, but on further investigation demonstrated ambulatory hypertension with evidence of hypertensive end-organ damage. This case suggests that hypertension may be a risk factor in children with stroke, especially in cases of lacunar infarct. Evaluation for possible hypertension should be undertaken thoroughly to identify children who may benefit from antihypertensive therapy and therefore, prevent recurrences.
