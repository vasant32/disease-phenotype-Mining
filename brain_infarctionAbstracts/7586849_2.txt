Sensory-motor deficit in a peripheral nerve pattern due to brain lesion is rarely documented. We report on seven patients with a clinical manifestation of sensory-motor deficit, imitating peripheral nerve involvement, due to lacunar brain infarcts verified by brain computed tomography scan. Five of the patients had an ulnar nerve-like deficit and two median nerve-like deficits. The infarcts were located in the thalamus and the corona radiata. No clinical or electrophysiological evidence for peripheral nerve involvement was found. The unusual peripheral nerve pattern of lesions caused by lacunar brain infarcts can be defined as an additional lacunar syndrome and must be taken into consideration in the clinical evaluation of peripheral nerve deficits with normal nerve conduction velocity.
