BACKGROUND: Traumatic acute SDH in pediatric patients is a life-threatening situation. There is a severe increase in ICP caused by acute SDH or diffuse brain swelling or secondary to ischemic brain damage. In certain situations, conventional measures may fail to control such a rapid increase in ICP. CASE DESCRIPTION: The cases of 4 pediatric patients with cranial trauma with raised ICP, in whom hemicranial decompression was performed, are described. All patients had acute SDH with diffuse brain injury; in addition, 2 of them had associated massive infarcts. Three of them survived and had a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In certain situations, pediatric patients with cranial trauma may be offered hemicranial decompression as a surgical option. These children may have a better long-term outcome despite massive infarcts.
