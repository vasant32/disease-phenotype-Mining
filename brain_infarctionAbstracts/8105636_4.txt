We have investigated the reliability of transcranial doppler compared with cerebral angiography in acute ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territories. We studied 48 patients, 28 men and 21 women, mean age 68.1 (range 54-75), observed within 5 h of the onset of ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. Ultrasound evaluation (duplex scanner and transcranial doppler) and cerebral angiography were carried out in close sequence immediately after CT scan. CT was repeated by Day 7 to estimate the infarct size: 27/48 patients had intracranial arterial obstructions. An acoustic temporal "window" was not found in 6.25%. Transcranial doppler showed a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 90.0% compared with cerebral Angiography for patients with patent acoustic temporal "windows". Accuracy was 79.2%, when patients with no "windows" were included. With respect to intracranial internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery mainstem, transcranial doppler showed a sensitivity of 95.0%, and a specificity of 92.0%. Including patients with no windows, accuracy was 87.5%. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Transcranial Doppler can be reliably used to demonstrate intracranial internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery mainstem obstructions in the acute phase of a brain infarction.
