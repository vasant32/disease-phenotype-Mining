A knowledge of events accompanying the acute coronary failure may help understanding the acute cerebral blood flow insufficiency leading to brain infarction. Cerebral blood flow should be treated as an integral part of the systemic blood circulation. It is of importance when the disease produces lesions to the vascular wall, and the brain looses its autoregulation functions. In such a situation every extracerebral disorders--even slight--may produce extensive lesions to nervous tissue. Therefore, the treatment of the acute cerebral circulation failure requires proper functioning of all factors which may affect hemodynamics and tissue metabolism. Duration of cerebral flow disorders plays an important role in the avoidance of unfavourable complications such as brain infarction. Therefore, every physician is obliged to undertake any possible actions preventing such complications.
