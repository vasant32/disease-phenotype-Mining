In older hypertensive persons, male gender, prior coronary artery disease, prior atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI), and echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy are independent risk factors for new coronary events; age, prior ABI, and echocardiographic LV hypertrophy are independent risk factors for new ABI. The data suggest that high plasma renin activity in hypertensive older persons is associated with a high risk of new coronary events and of new ABI through its association with echocardiographic LV hypertrophy.
