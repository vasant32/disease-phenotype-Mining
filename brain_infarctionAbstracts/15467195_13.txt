The present study evaluated the effect of wogonin, a flavonoid originated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis GEORGI, on focal ischemic brain injury in rats. Focal brain ischemia was induced by the permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (pMCAO) for 24 h with a silicone rubber cylinder inserted through the right internal carotid artery. We found that wogonin, intraperitoneally administered at a dosage of 20 mg/kg at 30 min before and 4 h after the surgery, reduced the pMCAO-induced infarct areas in the cerebral cortex as well as in the striatum. The total volume of infarction was significantly reduced by the treatment with wogonin. In addition, wogonin was found to significantly improve the pMCAO-induced behavioral deficits at 24 h after the surgery. Taken together, these results demonstrate that wogonin inhibits ischemic brain injury and improves behavioral dysfunction caused by pMCAO. These findings, along with previous reports demonstrating the neuroprotective effects of wogonin, provide strong pharmacological basis for the use of wogonin or Scutellaria baicalensis in the treatment of stroke.
