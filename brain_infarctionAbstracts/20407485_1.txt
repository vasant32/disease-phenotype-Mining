We evaluated the efficacy of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) for improving function in rats with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Three procedures underwent for each groups; MCAO and EGCG treatment, MCAO without treatment (MCAO control), and sham operation. Function was evaluated on days 1, 5, 10, and 14 after ischemia, using a modified sticky-tape test and the percentage weight borne on the paretic leg. Infarct volume did not differ between the EGCG-treated and MCAO control groups. Compared with the MCAO control group, the EGCG-treated group showed improved forelimb function and had normal function by day 10 (P<0.05). The improvements persisted until day 14 postischemia. In contrast, hind limb function did not differ between the EGCG-treated and MCAO control groups. Thus, EGCG improved certain aspects of function of forelimb until day 14 after MCAO in rats.
