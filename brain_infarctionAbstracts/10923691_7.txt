Enhancement of the inhibitory activity of GABA may protect ischemic neurons. We evaluated the neuroprotective effect of tiagabine, a novel GABA agonist, in reversible focal cerebral ischemia rats subjected to 2h middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Tiagabine was given at 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, i.p., 2 h after the onset of reperfusion. We found that post-ischemia treatment with tiagabine improved neurobehavioral outcome and reduced brain infarction volume in a dose-dependent manner. The data suggest that post-ischemic administration of tiagabine is neuroprotective in the focal cerebral ischemia model.
