Cerebroprotection after administration of glutamate receptor antagonists has been well documented. The present study is intended to determine whether the non-competitive alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-methyl-4-isoxazolyl-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist talampanel, known as antiepileptic drug, has neuroprotective effects in stroke models in rodents. The infarct size was measured in three models of stroke by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Therapeutic time window was also examined in rats subjected to 1h middle cerebral artery occlusion. The degree of neuroprotection was tested in mice, using 1.5, 2 h or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusions. Effect on photochemically induced thrombosis was investigated in rats applying 30 min time window after brain irradiation. Talampanel reduced the infarct size by 47.3% (p<0.01) after a 30 min delay and 48.5% (p<0.01) after 2 h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. In mice, talampanel reduced the extension of the infarcted tissue at the levels of striatum and hippocampus by 44.5% (p<0.05) and 39.3% (p<0.01) after 1.5 h transient ischemia and still caused 37.0% (p<0.05) and 37.0% (p<0.05) inhibitions when 2 h occlusion was applied. In photothrombosis talampanel showed a 40.1% (p<0.05) inhibition. Protective actions of talampanel in various stroke models, in rats and mice, suggest a possible therapeutic role of the compound in stroke patients.
