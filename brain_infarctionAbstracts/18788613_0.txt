OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ADAMTS13 antigen levels and activity in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and explore its significance in these diseases. METHODS: ADAMTS13 activity levels were detected by a new developed Frests-vWF73 kit, ADAMTS13 antigen levels by ELISA kit, and vWF multimers by electrophoresis. RESULTS: ADAMTS13 antigen in normal control, AMI and AIS was (878 +/- 198), (618 +/- 188) and (702 +/- 155) U/L, and ADAMTS13 activity was (81.7 +/- 13.9)%, (59.2 +/- 22.1 )% and (65.4 +/- 15.8)%, respectively, being significantly decreased in AMI and AIS patients. CONCLUSION: ADMATS13 might involve in arterial infarction diseases.
