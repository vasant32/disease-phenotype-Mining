 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The migratory efficiency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) toward cerebral infarct after transplantation is limited. Valproate (VPA) and lithium enhance in vitro migration of MSC by upregulating CXC chemokine receptor 4 and matrix metalloproteinase-9, respectively. Ability of VPA and lithium to promote MSC homing and to improve functional recovery was assessed in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. METHODS: MSC primed with VPA (2.5 mmol/L, 3 hours) and/or lithium chloride (2.5 mmol/L, 24 hours) were transplanted into rats 24 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neurological function was assessed via rotarod test, Neurological Severity Score, and body asymmetry test for 2 weeks. Infarct volume was analyzed by MRI. The number of homing MSC and microvessel density in the infarcted regions were measured 15 days after MCAO using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Priming with VPA or lithium increased the number of MSC homing to the cerebral infarcted regions, and copriming with VPA and lithium further enhanced this effect. MCAO rats receiving VPA-primed and/or lithium-primed MSC showed improved functional recovery, reduced infarct volume, and enhanced angiogenesis in the infarcted penumbra regions. These beneficial effects of VPA or lithium priming were reversed by AMD3100, a CXC chemokine receptor 4 antagonist, and GM6001, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Priming with VPA and/or lithium promoted the homing and migration ability of MSC, improved functional recovery, reduced brain infarct volume, and enhanced angiogenesis in a rat MCAO model. These effects were likely mediated by VPA-induced CXC chemokine receptor 4 overexpression and lithium-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 upregulation.
