Since a pioneer work that has shown in vitro that the rat's fibrinolytic system is 10-fold less sensitive to recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (rtPA) than the human system, most preclinical studies are performed with 10 instead of 0.9 mg/kg rtPA (the clinical dose in stroke patients). In this study, we compared the effects of these doses on mean time to reperfusion, reperfusion slope, brain infarct volume and edema in a rat model of thrombo-embolic stroke. Our data provide evidence that the dose of 0.9 mg/kg rtPA is as appropriate as that of 10 mg/kg for preclinical stroke studies in rodents.
