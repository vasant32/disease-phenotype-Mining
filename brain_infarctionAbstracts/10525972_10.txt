Abulia, memory loss, other cognitive deficits, and behavioral changes consistent with dementia can follow an inferior capsular genu infarction, but only little is known about the time course of these disturbances. The present study describes the long-term outcome of cognitive defects in four patients with inferior capsular genu infarction who underwent a neuropsychological examination within 3 and 12 months of onset. Three patients had infarcts in the inferior genu of the left internal capsule and had similar symptoms in the acute phase: disorientation, memory loss, language impairment, and behavioral changes. The patient with right-side infarct showed memory impairment and behavioral changes. Three patients had deficits in one or more cognitive domains on the first assessment, but none was demented. By the second evaluation all subjects had improved. In two patients there were a moderate memory defect persisted and a language disturbance. Improvement in these disturbances during long-time follow-up demonstrates that there are alternative pathways that reestablish the functional connections damaged by the strategically located capsular genu infarct. Inferior capsular genu infarction is not a cause of persisting "strategic infarct dementia."
