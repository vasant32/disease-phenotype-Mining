OBJECTIVES: Restricted sensory syndrome provides an excellent chance for the understanding of neuroanatomic correlation. The trigeminal nerve has been shown to convey buccal sensory impulse to central compartment. However, the pathway between cortex and the trigeminal sensory nucleus remains largely unknown. METHOD: A patient presented with cheirobuccopedal syndrome, or objective sensory impairment confined to the left intraoral cheek, hand and foot, was reported. RESULTS: Decrease in pinprick pain and fine touch sensation was detected at the left intraoral cheek, hand and foot. A recent infarction was disclosed at the left paramedian pons. The foregoing hypalgesia and hypesthesia recovered within one month after onset. DISCUSSION: The trigeminobuccal sensory tracts are deemed to run in parallel with other spinothalamic and trigeminothalamic tracts within the brainstem. The rarity of buccal sensory deficit upon brainstem damage may be due to dispersion of the trigeminobuccal sensory tracts on their way of ascending, or their relatively high tolerance to different insults.
