OBJECTIVE: To investigate the T13254C polymorphism frequency in GPVI gene among Chinese Han population and its relevance to the arterial thrombotic diseases. METHODS: The enrolled population in this study consisted of 314 healthy subjects and 274 patients with myocardial or cerebral infarctions. GPVI T13254C genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of a 355 bp fragment encompassing exon 5 of GPVI gene, followed by Msp I digestion of the product. The digested products were analyzed in 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). RESULTS: The frequencies of the T allele and C allele in the T13254C polymorphism were 0.9809 and 0.0191, respectively, with a frequency of heterozygous of 0.0319, which were significantly different from those reported in western population (P < 0.01). As compared with controls, no significant difference in T13254C genotype distribution was found in the arterial thrombotic diseases group. CONCLUSION: The GPVI T13254C polymorphism appears in a low frequency in Chinese Han population. No relationship is found between T13254C polymorphism and the risk for thrombotic diseases.
