The possible existence of distinctive, vascular bed specific alterations of coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters associated with three different types of thrombosis was investigated in young women (n = 68, <45 years at onset of the event) following myocardial infarction (MI) (n = 22), lacunar cerebral infarction (LACI) (n = 16), idiopathic deep vein thrombosis (VT) (n = 14) and venous thrombosis due to oral contraceptive use (n = 16) in the stable period after the acute thrombotic event. Coagulation and fibrinolytic parameters, as well as classical metabolic variables, were measured and compared with 52 age-matched, healthy controls. In MI women we observed elevated tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen levels, which correlated significantly with parameters of the plurimetabolic syndrome. In LACI women we found elevated fibrinogen, which correlated with D-dimer, systolic blood pressure, smoking, and sedimentation rate. Prolonged euglobulin clot lysis time, elevated t-PA antigen, PAI-1 antigen and activity, which all correlated with parameters of the plurimetabolic syndrome, were found in women with idiopathic VT, who were also clearly obese but not in women in whom oral contraceptives were the triggering factor for VT. Our results showed not parallel, but different profiles of alterations in fibrinolytic and coagulation parameters in line with the prediction of a vascular bed specific thrombosis process.
