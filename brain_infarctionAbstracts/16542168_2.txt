OBJECTIVES: To evaluate systemic endothelial function and atherosclerotic changes in patients with lacunar infarctions (LI) we examined flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and intima-media thickness (IMT) and compared them to patients with similar risk factors (SR) and healthy controls. METHODS: FMD and IMT were investigated in patients with LI (20 patients, aged 60.9 +/- 7.3 years), 21 age- and gender-matched patients with SR and 21 healthy controls. RESULTS: FMD was more impaired in patients with LI (0.4% +/- 5.0%) compared to patients with SR (3.8% +/- 4.8%) and healthy controls (7.9% +/- 6.0%) (P < or = 0.01), whereas IMT was similarly thickened in both groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with LI have a diminished FMD, but a similar IMT, compared to patients with SR. Our results reveal that for a given level of atherosclerosis patients with LI have additional endothelial impairment.
