Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is an intraoral burning sensation for which no medical or dental cause can be found. Recent studies suggest that primary neuropathic dysfunction might be involved in the pathogenesis of BMS. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays an important role in the development of pain and serves as a biological marker of trigeminovascular activation. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of CGRP in the saliva of BMS patients and estimate the trigeminovascular activation in BMS. CGRP levels were measured, by RIA method in 78 BMS patients and 16 healthy subjects. The levels of CGRP were non-significantly decreased in BMS patients in comparison to healthy subjects. These results suggest that trigeminal nerve degeneration may be the underlying cause of BMS.
