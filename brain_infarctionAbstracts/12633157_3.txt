A 63-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of fever and altered mentality. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple infarctions at the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and subcortical white matter with petechial hemorrhage, which was more easily seen on gradient echo images. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was cultured from her blood, and echocardiography showed septic vegetations in the mitral valve. She recovered fully after 6 weeks of appropriate antibiotic treatment.
