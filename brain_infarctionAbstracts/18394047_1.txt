BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Sorbin and SH3-domain-containing-1 (SORBS1) is an important adaptor protein in insulin-signalling pathway, and its genetic polymorphism may regulate the activity of insulin resistance. We investigated the association between the SORBS1 T228A polymorphism and ischaemic stroke. METHODS: Genotyping was achieved by a rapid-cycle PCR and melting curve analysis using fluorescent probes in 1049 incident cases of ischaemic stroke and 1049 age- and sex-matched control subjects recruited from the Hisayama study. RESULTS: The allele distributions of the SORBS1 T228A polymorphism were similar amongst cases and controls. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of the AA genotype for ischaemic stroke was 2.897 (95% CI, 0.907-8.018) compared with the TT genotype. In terms of stroke subtype, there was a trend toward a difference in the AA genotypes for lacunar infarction, compared with the TT genotype (OR = 8.740, P = 0.0510), and combined TT and TA genotypes (OR = 8.768, P = 0.0505). The other polymorphisms genotyped were not associated with any subtypes of ischaemic stroke. T228A polymorphism of SORBS1 was not associated with the prevalence of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The AA genotype of SORBS1 T228A polymorphism may play a role in lacunar infarction in the Japanese population.
