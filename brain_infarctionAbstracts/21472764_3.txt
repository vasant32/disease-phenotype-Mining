Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) protects against neuronal damages in the brain. In the present study, ischemia-induced changes in GLP-1R immunoreactivity in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region were evaluated after transient cerebral ischemia; in addition, the neuroprotective effect of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (EX-4) against ischemic damage was studied. GLP-1R immunoreactivity and its protein levels in the ischemic CA1 region were highest at 1 day after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). At 4 days after I/R, GLP-1R immunoreactivity was hardly detected in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and its protein level was lowest. GLP-1R protein level was increased again at 10 days after I/R, and GLP-1R immunoreactivity was found in astrocytes and GABAergic interneurons. In addition, EX-4 treatment attenuated ischemia-induced hyperactivity, neuronal damage, and microglial activation in the ischemic CA1 region in a dose-dependent manner. EX-4 treatment also induced the elevation of GLP-1R immunoreactivity and protein levels in the ischemic CA1 region. These results indicate that GLP-1R is altered in the ischemic region after an ischemic insult and that EX-4 protects against ischemia-induced neuronal death possibly by increasing GLP-1R expression and attenuating microglial activation against transient cerebral ischemic damage.
