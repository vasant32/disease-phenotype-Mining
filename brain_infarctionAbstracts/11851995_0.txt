BACKGROUND: To characterize the clinical features, etiology and prognosis in cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Descriptive study of 17 patients with cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome included in the Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona Stroke Registry over a 11 year period. RESULTS: Cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome was present in 6 patients (35%), cheiro-oral syndrome in 10 (59%) and isolated oral syndrome in 1 (6%). Cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome was caused by a lacunar infarct in 88% of patients and by atherotrombotic infarcts in 12%. Cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome accounted for 0.7% of all acute strokes (n = 2.244), 1% of all cerebral infarcts (n = 1.649), 3.5% of all lacunar infarcts (n = 422) and 18.5% of all pure sensory lacunar infarcts (n = 80). Thalamus (n = 13), internal capsule (n = 2), striatocapsular involvement (n = 1) and fronto-parietal involvement (n = 1) were the cerebral topographies. Absence of in hospital mortality and absence or mild neurological deficit at discharge from the hospital were present in all the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Lacune hypothesis is present in cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome. Cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome was caused by a lacunar infarct in 88% of patients. The thalamic topography is the most frequent and the prognosis in cheiro-oral-pedal syndrome is good.
