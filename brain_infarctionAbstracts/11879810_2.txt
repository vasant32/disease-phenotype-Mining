The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ischemic preconditioning on infarct volume in a rat model of subdural hematoma (SDH). Ischemic preconditioning was induced by 15 min transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed 3 days later by the injection of 300 microl of autologous venous blood into the subdural space. Preconditioning significantly reduced the volume of cortical infarction (by 26%, P<0.001) 24 h after SDH induction, but not brain swelling (P>0.05) relative to sham-operated non-preconditioned animals. These data support the view that ischemic preconditioning reduces ischemic brain damage in this rat model of SDH.
