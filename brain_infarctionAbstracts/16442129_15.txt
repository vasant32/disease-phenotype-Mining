Ischemic stroke results from a transient or permanent reduction in cerebral blood flow that is restricted to the territory of a major brain artery. The major pathobiological mechanisms of ischemia/reperfusion injury include excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. In the present report, we first investigated the protective effects of anthocyanins against focal cerebral ischemic injury in rats. The pretreatment of anthocyanins (300 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the brain infarct volume and a number of TUNEL positive cells caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. In the immunohistochemical observation, anthocyanins remarkably reduced a number of phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) and p53 immunopositive cells in the infarct area. Moreover, Western blotting analysis indicated that anthocyanins suppressed the activation of JNK and up-regulation of p53. Thus, our data suggested that anthocyanins reduced neuronal damage induced by focal cerebral ischemia through blocking the JNK and p53 signaling pathway. These findings suggest that the consumption of anthocyanins may have the possibility of protective effect against neurological disorders such as brain ischemia.
