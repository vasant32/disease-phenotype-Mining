The association between cytokines (IL-1 beta, sIL-4R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha) and subcortical white matter lesions, cortical atrophy and lacunar infarctions of the aging brain was investigated among 268 elderly community participants. Single pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were neither associated with WML nor with atrophy and lacunar infarction. An association between atrophy and the chemokine-cytokine factor (containing sIL-4R, IL-6, IL-8) remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, education, depressive symptoms, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases (stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, myocardial insufficiency, arrhythmic heart), hypertension, body-mass index, smoking status and aggregation inhibitors as opposed to single cytokines. Atrophy of the parietal, temporal and occipital lobes was associated with the same cytokine-chemokine factor for both the whole sample or restricted to those without history of stroke/TIA. The results indicate that a combination of chemokine-cytokines rather than single cytokines may contribute to inflammatory processes associated with cortical atrophy in the aging brain.
