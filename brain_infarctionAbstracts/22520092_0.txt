 BACKGROUND: Kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, play a pivotal role in endothelial dysfunction, which may lead to silent brain infarction (SBI). We evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of KDR genes are associated with increased risk of SBI in a Korean population. METHODS: A total of 383 patients with SBI and 387 controls were genotyped for the KDR -604T>C, 1192G>A, and 1719A>T SNPs. We separately analyzed this association according to the age (ageâ‰¥65 and age<65) and the gender. We also compared haplotype frequencies between SBI patients and controls. RESULTS: Genotype frequencies for three SNPs did not differ significantly between SBI patients and controls. In addition, haplotype analysis for three SNPs did not show a difference between patients and controls. However, the frequency of genotype of KDR -604T>C was significantly associated with an increased risk of SBI in the age<65 years old group (AOR=1.515, 95% CI, 1.003 to 2.289, p=0.048) and in male group (AOR=1.596, 95% CI, 1.018 to 2.503, p=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: KDR -604T>C SNP may serve as genetic markers for the increased risk of SBI among the younger (<65 years) or male only Korean subpopulations.
