Elevation of extracellular levels of amino acids has been implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke. The failure of brain energy metabolism due to the lack of oxygen and glucose contributes also to cell loss. Estrogen has been shown to protect brain cells against ischemia by a still unclear mechanism. We used intracerebral microdialysis to monitor the effects of acute 17beta-estradiol treatment on the release of glutamate and aspartate and on the levels of the energy metabolites glucose and lactate. In male rats subjected to 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 24-h reperfusion, acute treatment with 17beta-estradiol (0.8 mg/kg, i.v.) at the time of occlusion reduced the ischemic infarct by about 50%. In these treated rats, the ischemia-induced increases of extracellular levels of glutamate and aspartate were significantly and rapidly reduced. The reduction of glucose level during occlusion was not affected by 17beta-estradiol treatment; however, the increase of extracellular lactate was reduced during occlusion and reperfusion, probably due to the reduced glutamate-driven astrocytic glycolysis. These data suggest that acute treatment with 17beta-estradiol at the onset of occlusion significantly reduces the ischemia-induced excitotoxicity in the cortex, a mechanism that may participate in the neuroprotective effect on cellular survival.
