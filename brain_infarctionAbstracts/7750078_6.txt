Writer's cramp is frequently associated with hand tremor and with other focal dystonias. Sometimes brain infarction, haemorrhage, arterio-venous malformations or tumors are found to cause symptomatic focal dystonias. A 44-year-old man came to our attention due to writer's cramp of his right hand and postural 6-8 Hz tremor. About three months after the onset of the disease the tremor and dystonia disappeared, while a right hemiparesis gradually appeared. Cranial computed tomography showed a hypodense nonhomogeneous lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere parietally, that was assumed to represent a cystic tumor. The patient underwent craniotomy and the histological diagnosis revealed an astrocytoma (Grade II-III). In conclusion our findings confirm the common anatomical basis of symptomatic focal dystonia and tremor. Both can appear after disruption of the pathways within and adjacent to the basal ganglia.
