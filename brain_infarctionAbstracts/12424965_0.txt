A 21 year-old female college student with a history of Turner syndrome at age 9, and 6-year growth hormone replacement therapy noticed weakness of right extremities when she got up on March 26, 2001. On admission, she showed right hemiparesis (4+/5) and hypesthesia on the right of body. The hemiparesis progressed (3-/5) in spite of antithrombotic therapy. Brain MRI revealed a high intensity lesion with a diameter of 1.5 cm in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule and putamen on DWI and T2WI. MR angiography and TC-CFI revealed no stenosis in her left middle cerebral artery, but > 50% stenosis in the horizontal portion (M1) of her right middle cerebral artery. Branch lesions were presumed to exist in the left M1. Non-atherosclerotic angiopathy, coagulopathy, and other conventional risk factors of brain infarction were not found. Pathogenesis of Turner syndrome might have played a role in the development of brain infarction in this patient.
