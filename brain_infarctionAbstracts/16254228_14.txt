BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We addressed whether dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) is affected in middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory (MCAS) and lacunar ischemic stroke (LS). METHODS: Blood pressure (MAP) and MCA velocity (V) were measured in 10 patients with large MCAS (National Institutes of Health Stroke score, 17+/-2; mean+/-SEM), in 10 with LS (score, 9+/-1), and in 10 reference subjects. dCA was evaluated in time (delay of the MCA Vmean counter-regulation during changes in MAP) and frequency domains (cross-spectral MCA Vmean-to-MAP phase lead). RESULTS: In reference subjects, latencies for MAP increments (5.3+/-0.5 seconds) and decrements (5.6+/-0.5 seconds) were comparable, and low frequency MCA Vmean-to-MAP phase lead was 56+/-5 and 59+/-5 degrees (left and right hemisphere). In MCAS, these latencies were 4.6+/-0.7 and 5.6+/-0.5 seconds in the nonischemic hemisphere and not detectable in the ischemic hemisphere. In the unaffected hemisphere, phase lead was 61+/-6 degrees versus 26+/-6 degrees on the ischemic side (P<0.05). In LS, no latency and smaller phase lead bilaterally (32+/-6 and 33+/-5 degrees) conformed to globally impaired dCA. CONCLUSIONS: In large MCAS infarcts, dynamic cerebral autoregulation was impaired in the affected hemisphere. In LS, dynamic cerebral autoregulation was impaired bilaterally, a finding consistent with the hypothesis of bilateral small vessel disease in patients with lacunar infarcts.
