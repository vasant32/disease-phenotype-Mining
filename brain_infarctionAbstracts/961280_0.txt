A total of 85 experimental animals received through the blood flux of the carotid arteries clots of autogenic blood of 1 hour age. A histomorphological study after 40 minutes following an embolism there were revealed clots in the cerebral arteries in 13 out of 14 animals. After 1.5 hours in 1 of 17, and after 24 hours in none of the 10 animals. Directly following the administration of clots in all the 20 animals of this series, there were symptoms of focal brain lesions: hemipareses, ptosis and myosis, a "trot around circles", etc. In all 20 animals there was a complete regress of the symptom at different times (from 10 min to 18 hours). In all cases there was an increased amount of lactic acid in the cerebral blood outflow while subsequently was reduced, correlating with the time of clot lysis. The morphological control did not depict brain infarctions. It is assumed that the reason of brain dysfunctions is an obturation by blood clots of cerebral arteries, while their normalization is due to a spontaneous lysis of the embols which obturated the cerebral arteries.
