We reported 2 patients with top of the basilar syndrome manifested by onset seizure. Patient 1 was a 76-year-old man. When he was sleeping, suddenly he gave a loud cry and went into convulsions. So he was brought to our hospital by ambulance. On admission, he had unconsciousness and left hemiplegia. Patient 2 was a 70-year-old man. When he was bathing, he lost his consciousness and brought to our hospital by ambulance. On admission, he had convulsion and tetraplegia. Both patients had convulsions and palsy when they had brain infarctions. Brain diffusion weighted MR image showed high intensity area in bilateral internal thalamus, brainstem and cerebellum and no high intensity area in cerebral cortex. We know well that Todd's palsy is palsy after convulsion, but vertebro-basilar occlusion also shows convulsion and palsy. Therefore attention should be paid in the case of the patients who had convulsion and palsy.
