We report a case of non-curatively resected gastric cancer successfully treated with postoperative continuous chemotherapy, resulting in long-term survival of 19 months. A 75-year-old woman underwent non-curative resection with total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis in June, 2005. Postoperatively, at first, she received oral administration of S-1. However, due to grade 2-3 nausea and anorexia, the dose of S-1 was reduced. After four courses, the value of the tumor markers increased. Next, we chose sequential methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil therapy, but no decrease tumor markers could be obtained. Then, 9 months after surgery, biweekly paclitaxel (PTX) chemotherapy was performed. The value of the tumor markers gradually decreased or stopped increasing, and PTX was administered 18 times. In this period, the quality of life of this patient was good. Eighteen months after surgery, the value of the tumor markers increased again, and S-1 and CPT-11 combination therapy was chosen. However, the patient died of brain infarction 19 months after surgery. Thus, continuous and persevering chemotherapy could be effective for advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis and may be promising for long-term survival.
