Sickle cell anemia is a common genetic condition that may have ischemic brain infarct and hemorrhagic complications, these being known as major complications. The incidence of stroke in children with sickle cell anemia is similar to that presented by the elderly in the general population. A case of a schoolchild that debuted with synchronous bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage is discussed. To our knowledge this is the first report in the literature of synchronous bilateral gangliobasal bleeding in a schoolchild with sickle cell anemia.
