Tacrolimus (FK506), an immunosuppressive drug, is known to have potent neuroprotective activity and attenuate cerebral infarction in experimental models of stroke. Here we assess the neuroprotective efficacy of tacrolimus in a nonhuman primate model of stroke, photochemically induced thrombotic occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in cynomolgus monkeys. In the first experiment, tacrolimus (0.01, 0.032, or 0.1 mg/kg) was intravenously administered immediately after MCA occlusion, and neurologic deficits and cerebral infarction volumes were assessed 24 hours after the ischemic insult. Tacrolimus dose-dependently reduced neurologic deficits and infarction volume in the cerebral cortex, with statistically significant amelioration of neurologic deficits at 0.032 and 0.1 mg/kg and significant reduction of infarction at 0.1 mg/kg. In the second experiment, the long-term efficacy of tacrolimus on neurologic deficits and cerebral infarction was assessed. Vehicle-treated monkeys exhibited persistent and severe deficits in motor and sensory function for up to 28 days. A single intravenous bolus injection of tacrolimus (0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg) produced long-lasting amelioration of neurologic deficits and significant reduction of infarction volume. In conclusion, we have provided compelling evidence that a single dose of tacrolimus not only reduces brain infarction but also ameliorates long-term neurologic deficits in a nonhuman primate model of stroke, strengthening the view that tacrolimus might be beneficial in treating stroke patients.
