A 39-year-old man presented with headache, weight loss, bilateral subdural hematomas, pansinusitis, and visual loss. The neuro-ophthalmologic examination disclosed deep choroidal lesions and bilateral optic disc edema. Orchiectomy for testicular torsion showed acute vasculitis consistent with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing revealed hepatitis C. This is the first reported case of PAN due to hepatitis C with early findings of choroidal and optic nerve infarction.
