OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcome of patients with a cryptogenic infarct (CI) after a follow-up period of 1 year. METHODS: From our prospective registry of stroke, during a 4-year period, we've identified 121 consecutive patients with a CI (15.1% of all infarcts). They have been followed up for 1 year and we have registered stroke recurrence, cardiovascular events and other incidences. RESULTS: Mean age 70.6 years-old, 53% male. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) was the most often involved territory (52 cases), 70% of them with cortical involvement. No patient died during admission, 95.8% received antiplatelet therapy and 4.1% oral anticoagulant. Fourteen patients were lost of follow-up. During 1-year period, atrial fibrillation (AF) was detected in 7 patients (6.54%), their mean age was 75 years-old, in 5 of them the CI was in MCA territory (4 with cortical involvement, 1 only deep infarct). Three patients (2.76%) suffered a recurrent ischemic stroke, in weeks 15, 16 and 44 after the CI. In all 3 cases the infarct was considered cryptogenic again. Two patients suffered a myocardial infarction and 4 died during follow-up period. CONCLUSION: In our series rate of stroke recurrence and cardiovascular events after a CI was low. An 11% of patients with a CI involving cortical MCA territory developed FA during the following year.
