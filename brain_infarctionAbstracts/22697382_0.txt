CNS aspergillosis is often missed in the setting of advanced HIV infection, especially in the absence of presumed risk factors such as neutropenia or prior steroid treatment. We describe the postmortem evaluation of the brain of a patient with AIDS that developed progressive neurologic deterioration. Sequence brain MRIs, CSF analysis, and multiple presumed treatments failed to reveal the possible causes or improve his ongoing condition. His brain autopsy showed numerous abscesses with septated hyphae consistent with CNS angioinvasive aspergillosis.
