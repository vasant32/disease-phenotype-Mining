Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is an important clinical problem with few effective treatments. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is an endogenous peptide hormone of the hematopoietic system that has been shown to be neuroprotective in focal ischemia in vivo and is currently in phase I/II clinical trials for ischemic stroke in humans. We tested G-CSF in a rat model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia in postnatal day 7 unsexed rat pups. Three groups of animals were used: hypoxia-ischemia (HI, n=67), hypoxia-ischemia with G-CSF treatment (HI+G, n=65), and healthy control (C, n=53). G-CSF (50 microg/kg, subcutaneous) was administered 1 h after HI and given on four subsequent days (five total injections). Animals were euthanized 24 h, 1, 2, and 3 weeks after HI. Assessment included brain weight, histology, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting. G-CSF treatment was associated with improved quantitative brain weight and qualitative Nissl histology after hypoxia-ischemia. TUNEL demonstrated reduced apoptosis in group HI+G. Western blot demonstrated decreased expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in group HI+G. G-CSF treatment was also associated with increased expression of STAT3, Bcl-2, and Pim-1, all of which may have participated in the anti-apoptotic effect of the drug. We conclude that G-CSF ameliorates hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and that this may occur in part by an inhibition of apoptotic cell death.
