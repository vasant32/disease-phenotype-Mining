OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of protocols in a neurological department. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam. METHOD: Protocols were drafted by residents and staff members, criticised in protocol meetings and amended if necessary. During 6 months it was ascertained in each newly admitted patient (n = 317), whether a protocol was available, whether it was used and if not, why not. RESULTS: During the period before the introduction of the protocol for brain infarction and TIA (the largest category), protocols were available for 20% of the patients and used in 61% of those patients. After introduction of the brain infarction/TIA protocol, these percentages rose to 46 and 82, respectively. Protocols were not used if doctors were not aware of them or forgot to use them or if they were not applicable to individual patients. CONCLUSION: Writing and implementing protocols are feasible in neurological departments.
