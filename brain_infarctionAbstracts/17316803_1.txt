We report a case of persistent anterograde amnesia secondary to an anterior thalamic infarct. A 49-year-old right-handed man is referred for acute anterograde amnesia. Diffusion-weighted imaging performed at 24 hours shows an acute punctiform infarct of the left anterior thalamus, while T2-weighted imaging reveals a contralateral and symmetrical ischemic sequelae in the right anterior thalamus. The two lesions are isolated and remarkably centered with the mamillothalamic tract. We suggest the symptoms are caused by the addition of the two lesions interrupting the mamillothalamic tracts. This is the second clinico-pathological observation of a persistent amnestic syndrome secondary to a bilateral lesion of the mamillothalamic tract.
