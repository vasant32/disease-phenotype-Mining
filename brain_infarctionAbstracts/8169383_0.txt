AIM: To evaluate the effects of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists on the cerebral circulation in stroke patients. DESIGN OF STUDIES: Mean cerebral circulation parameters were studied in chronic stroke patients with hypertension and treated acutely or chronically (2 weeks) with nicardipine or nifedipine retard. The effects of nicardipine on local cerebral blood flow were also studied in patients with a subacute brain infarction. RESULTS: Mean cerebral blood flow was significantly increased after a single oral administration of nicardipine but not after nifedipine retard. Both calcium antagonists reduced mean arterial pressure. Nifedipine retard acted mainly by reducing blood pressure and nicardipine mainly by reducing cerebrovascular resistance. CONCLUSION: Dihydropyridines have a beneficial effect in the control of hypertension in stroke patients.
