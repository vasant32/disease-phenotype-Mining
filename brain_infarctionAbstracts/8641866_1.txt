Lung transplantation is becoming an acceptable mode of therapy worldwide for the end-stage lung disease. We present our initial experience with the first 10 consecutive lung transplant patients at Hadassah University Hospital. There were 5 males and 5 females with an age range 27 to 59 years. Eight patients underwent single lung transplantation, one patient had double lung transplantation and one had heart-lung transplantation. Indications were: pulmonary fibrosis in 4, emphysema in 4, cystic fibrosis in 1, and cystic bronchiectasis in 1. Two patients had primary graft failure (1 death). Nine patients had a serious infection after transplantation (1 death). Four patients developed airway complications including dehiscence of bronchial anastomosis (1 death), bronchial stenosis requiring placement of a stent in 2 patients, and pneumothorax in 1 patient. One patient required tracheostomy. One patient died of massive brain infarction secondary to pulmonary venous thrombosis and embolization. Six patients are intermediate-term survivors, with a follow-up period of 4-24 months. Four of them had at least one episode of rejection each. In all survivors pulmonary functions and quality of life improved and they do not need supplemental oxygen. We conclude that lung transplantation is a viable option for end-stage lung disease. Better selection of patients and perhaps improved immunosuppression agents will further improve outcome in lung transplantation. Shortage of donor supply is currently the limiting factor in successful lung transplantation in Israel.
