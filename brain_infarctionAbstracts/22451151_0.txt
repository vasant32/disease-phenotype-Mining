We report a new aortic arch occlusion technique with a balloon for distal aortic arch repair via left thoracotomy using an open proximal method. Distal aortic arch repair via left thoracotomy sometimes causes brain infarction and perioperative myocardial infarction. That is because air or debris enters into coronary arteries and cervical branches and the left ventricle. Occlusion of the aortic arch using a balloon can prevent such perioperative complications.
