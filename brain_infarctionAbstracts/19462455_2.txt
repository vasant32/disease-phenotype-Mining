The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and neuroprotective mechanisms of UCF-101, a novel Omi/HtrA2 inhibitor, following ischemia/reperfusion brain injury. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 2 hr of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Animals were divided into 3 groups: sham, vehicle-treated ischemia/reperfusion, and UCF-101 treatment. In the UCF-101 treatment group, rats were intraperitoneally administered UCF-101 (1.5 micromol/kg) 10 min prior to reperfusion. The rats were evaluated for neurological deficits, and brain infarct volume was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride. TUNEL staining was utilized to evaluate the amount of apoptosis. In addition, expressions of protein caspase-8, caspase-3, FasL, and FLIP were examined by Western blot analysis. Results demonstrated that UCF-101 treatment significantly decreased cerebral infarct size by about 16.27% (P < 0.05) and also improved neurological behavior. TUNEL staining revealed that UCF-101 treatment significantly reduced TUNEL-positive cells in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, the upregulation in the expression of FasL and the cleavage products of active caspase-8 and caspase-3 induced by ischemia was attenuated in mice treated with UCF-101, whereas upregulation of FLIP levels was increased. The present results demonstrated that UCF-101 protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice. UCF-101 provided neuroprotection in vivo, and this was correlated with regulation of Fas-mediated apoptotic proteins. Taken together, the use of UCF-101 is a potent, neuroprotective factor for the treatment of focal cerebral ischemia.
