EPC-K1, L-ascorbic acid 2-[3,4-dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2-(4,8,12-trimethyltridecyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-6-yl-hydrogen phosphate] potassium salt, is a novel antioxidant. In this study, we investigated a reduction of oxidative neuronal cell damage with EPC-K1 by immunohistochemical analysis for 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in rat brain with 60 min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, in association with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) and staining for total and active caspase-3. Treatment with EPC-K1 (20 mg kg(-1) i.v.) significantly reduced infarct size (p < 0.05) at 24 h of reperfusion. There were no positive cells for 8-OHdG and TUNEL in sham-operated brain, but numerous cells became positive for 8-OHdG, TUNEL and caspase-3 in the brains with ischemia. The number was markedly reduced in the EPC-K1 treated group. These reductions were particularly evident in the border zone of the infarct area, but the degree of reduction was less in caspase-3 staining than in 8-OHdG and TUNEL stainings. These results indicate EPC-K1 attenuates oxidative neuronal cell damage and prevents neuronal cell death.
