Prospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), neuropsychological testing and neurological examinations were performed to determine the long-term effect of successful haematopoietic stem cell transplantation on the neurological status of nine children with sickle cell disease. A scoring system for severity of brain parenchymal and vascular lesions was developed and applied. Neurological examinations and neuropsychometric tests were stable, but MRI and MRA studies were not. Transient changes occurred early in two patients. Persistent changes occurred in five. Parenchymal lesions occurred in zero of two patients without prior lacunae or infarcts and in all seven with prior lacunae or infarcts (P = 0.0278).
