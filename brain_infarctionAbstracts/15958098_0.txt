Pure sensory syndrome (PSS) is characterized by hemisensory symptoms without other major neurological signs. It was initially attributed to thalamic lacunar infarction, but several reports have shown the PSS can be due to small infarcts involving the posterior part of the internal capsula, the cerebral cortex and the brainstem. Paramedian and lateral pontine infarctions are associated respectively with lemniscal and spinothalmic (ST) sensory impairment. We describe a patient with an isolated impairment of the ST modalities caused by a segmental paramedian pontine infarction.
