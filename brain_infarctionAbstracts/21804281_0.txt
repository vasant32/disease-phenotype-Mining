 OBJECTIVE: Several reports have indicated that cilostazol is effective in the prevention of recurrence after cerebral infarction. However, cilostazol is inferior in tolerability for the adverse events than other anti-platelet agents. The goal of this study was to determine whether cilostazol escalation oral administration affects its tolerability. METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight patients hospitalized for brain infarction with cilostazol treatment in our stroke center from 2006 to 2008 were enrolled in this study. During this term, we had two teams in our center and used different regimens. One of which used 100 mg b.i.d. regimen of cilostazol (Standard group) and the other used 50 mg b.i.d. for the initial 4 days, followed by a dose of 100 mg b.i.d. of it (Escalation group). Patient's information such as baseline characteristics, adverse events, were collected and statistically analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in Standard group and 87 patients in Escalation group. Comparison between these groups demonstrated that Escalation group had fewer patients who discontinued treatment (p=0.001) and a lower incidence of headache (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: This type of dose escalation regimen of cilostazol may be superior to the standard regimen in tolerability.
