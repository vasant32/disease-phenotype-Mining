The paper presents data concerning the incidence of brain strokes and the mortality rate. These indices were received for the first time on a large population by the method of brain stroke register. The frequency of brain strokes during one year equaled to 2.5 cases, the mortality rate 1 case per 1000 population. Genuine indices of the incidence and mortality rates for different age groups were established. They appeared to be relatively high in people over 60 years. The mortality coefficient is higher in females. In brain infarctions the frequency and mortality is higher than in brain and subarachnoidal hemorrhages.
