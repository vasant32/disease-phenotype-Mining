BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The influence of stroke subtype on recurrence, and determinants of recurrence-free survival after a first-ever stroke are not fully understood. We aimed to clarify the long-term prognosis by stroke subtypes and to identify determinants for recurrence and death after a first-ever stroke. METHODS: We enrolled 1,732 consecutive patients (men/women = 1,134/598, mean age of 65 years) with a first-ever acute stroke who were admitted to our Stroke Care Unit during a period of 20 years. Stroke subtypes were classified as atherothrombotic brain infarction, lacunar infarction, cardioembolic infarction, other type of infarction, and brain hemorrhage. The prognosis was assessed by stroke subtypes. RESULTS: During the hospital stay (mean 61 days), 99 patients died: 73 died directly from stroke. A total of 198 patients had recurrent strokes, and 286 died within 3 years after the index stroke. The overall recurrence rate within the first year was 6.5%, which was different among stroke subtypes. Patients with cardioembolic infarction (9.0%) as well as other type of infarction (9.1%) had more recurrent strokes within the initial year compared with the other subtypes. A history of transient ischemic attack (relative risk = 1.38), atrial fibrillation (1.52), ischemic heart disease (1.40), and disability at discharge (2.64) were independent predictors for the recurrence and death within 3 years after the first-ever stroke. CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence rate was different among stroke subtypes within 1 year after the index stroke. Atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, history of transient ischemic attack, and disability at discharge were important determinants for stroke recurrence and death.
