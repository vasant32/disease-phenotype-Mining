Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in plasma of patients with vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity. APS is considered the major cause of brain infarction in young adults and is a generally accepted cause of recurrent pregnancy loss. Antiphospholipid antibodies are a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies strongly related to the clinical manifestations of APS and with a widely recognized pathogenic role in thrombosis. In this article, recent clinical and pathophysiological advances in APS are discussed.
