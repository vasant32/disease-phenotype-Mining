Persons at high risk of cardiovascular disease can be effectively identified from a measurement of their serum cholesterol and blood pressure, a smoking history, an electrocardiogram and a determination of glucose intolerance. One general function for identifying persons at high risk of cardiovascular disease is also effective in identifying persons at risk for each of the specific diseases, coronary heart disease, atherothrombotic brain infarction, hypertensive heart disease and intermittent claudication, even though the variables used have a different impact on each particular disease. The 10 percent of persons identified with use of this function as at highest risk accounted for about one fifth of the 8 year incidence of coronary heart disease and about one third of the 8 year incidence of atherothrombotic brain infarction, hypertensive heart disease and intermittent claudication. Hence the function provides an economic and efficient method of identifying persons at high cardiovascular risk who need preventive treatment and persons at low risk who need not be alarmed about one moderately elevated risk characteristic.
