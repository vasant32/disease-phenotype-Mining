 BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factors, clinical features and early outcome of first-ever cerebral lacunar infarcts from 1986 to 2004, using the Sagrat Cor Hospital of Barcelona Stroke Registry, were assessed and compared with data from patients with nonlacunar infarction. METHODS: The study population consisted of 566 patients with lacunar infarct and 1,516 patients with nonlacunar infarct. Secular trends for the periods 1986-1992, 1993-1998 and 1999-2004 were analyzed. RESULTS: Age and the percentage of very old patients (≥85 years old) increased significantly (p < 0.001) throughout the time period. There was a significant decrease in the percentage of patients with hypertension, but the percentage of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased. The use of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also increased significantly. The median length of hospital stay decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Significant changes over a 19-year period included an increase in the patients' age, frequency of very old patients (≥85 years old) and use of MRI studies, whereas the frequency of hypertension and length of hospital stay decreased.
