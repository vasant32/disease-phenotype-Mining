The prevalence and implications of vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (VBD), a causative arteriopathy of stroke are unclear in Asian stroke patients. Through a comparative study of VBD and non-VBD stroke patients, we aimed to elucidate the clinicoradiologic features of VBD patients in Japan. A total of 481 consecutive patients (302 men and 179 women) with acute stroke were admitted to our department between 2007 and 2008. Of these 481 inpatients, 374 (231 men and 143 women) had brain infarct (BI), and 107 (71 men and 36 women) had brain hemorrhage (BH). We reviewed medical records, and VBD was diagnosed by magnetic resonance angiography. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profile, modified Rankin scale score at 30 days poststroke, and stroke lesions were compared among 4 groups: the VBD BI group, the VBD BH group, the non-VBD BI group, and the non-VBD BH group. The diameter, height, and lateral displacement of the basilar artery (BA) were analyzed in the VBD patients. Statistical analyses used multivariate logistic regression analysis. VBD was found in 37 patients (34 men and 3 women). Mean age (± SD) was 64.4 ± 14.7 years (63.4 ± 14.6 years in men and 65.3 ± 6.1 years in women). Twenty-four patients (21 men and 3 women) had BI, and 13 men had BH. There were significant male preferences in VBD BI (P < .01) and VBD BH patients (P < .01). Mean age (± SD) was 67.7 ± 14.3 years in BI patients and 56.7 ± 12.7 years in BH patients. The VBD BH men were significantly younger than the non-VBD BH men (P < .05) and VBD BI men (P < .01). Frequency of current smoking was significantly greater in VBD BI patients compared with non-VBD BI patients (P < .05). Other CVD risk factors did not differ among the 4 groups. Mean modified Rankin Scale score was significantly higher in VBD BH men compared with non-VBD BH men and VBD BI men (P < .01). The height and lateral displacement of the BA were scored more severely in BH patients than in BI patients (P < .01), but BA diameter did not differ between BH and BI patients. The frequency of pontine infarct and hemorrhage was 3-fold greater in VBD BI (P < .05) and VBD BH patients (P < .005) compared with non-VBD BI and BH patients. Our findings indicate a VBD prevalence of 7.7% in stroke patients, 6.4% in BI patients, and 12.1% in BH patients. Our clinicoradiologic analyses suggest male predominance, younger onset of BH, and higher frequency of pontine lesions in VBD patients. Significant BA changes and poor outcome of stroke were found in patients with hemorrhagic VBD rather than ischemic VBD. Thus, more attention should be paid to risk and care of BH in VBD patients, in addition to those of BI.
