OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of some active Chinese herbal fraction on protein expression of brain tissue in ischemic mouse with proteomic technique. METHODS: Ischemia-reperfusion mice were treated with baicalin, geniposide, cholic acid and concha margaritifera respectively for 3 hrs, and then their brain tissue were taken to extract the total protein. Protein expression in ischemic mouse brain was analyzed with surface-enhanced laser desorption/inionation-time of flight-mass spectra (SELDI-TOF-MS) protein-chip. RESULTS: The four components tested had effect on 3 target proteins at 5373Da, 5707Da and 15103Da, showing the nature of multi-target and with different action on protein expression. CONCLUSION: Protein-chip is an effective approach for exploring the pharmacological mechanism of Chinese herbal fraction.
