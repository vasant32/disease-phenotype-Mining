A neurootologist examined 233 successive cases of acute disabling vertigo from the Clinic of Neurology of Turku University Central Hospital. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 24 patients had evidence of acute cerebral or cerebellar brain infarction. The examination scheme included a case history analysis, clinical neurootological examination and electronystagmography (ENG). The audiological examination included pure-tone thresholds and speech audiometry. The ENG analyses were done by two neurootologists who had no information about the aetiology of the diseases. A central disturbance in ENG was observed in 59% (10/17) of the patients with cerebral brain infarction and 71% (5/7) of the patients with cerebellar brain infarction. ENG is not valid as a screening method for the central aetiology of vertigo; imaging of the central nervous system is needed.
