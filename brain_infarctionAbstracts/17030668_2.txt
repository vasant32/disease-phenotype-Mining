OBJECTIVE: To report cluster breathing pattern associated with a nonbrainstem lesion. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Neurointensive care unit, St Mary's Hospital, Rochester, Minn. PATIENT: A patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage developed severe, diffuse, distal bilateral middle cerebral artery vasospasm with resultant cortical laminar necrosis and transient cluster breathing. Intervention Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bihemispheric lesions but no brainstem lesion. CONCLUSION: Cluster breathing may occur with nonbrainstem lesions.
