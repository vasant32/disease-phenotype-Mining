AIM: To study subclinical signs of cerebrovascular pathology as prognostic factors of development of acute disorders of cerebral circulation (ADCC) in essential hypertension (EH). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective (10-13 years) cohort trial of prognostic significance of subclinical forms of cerebral pathology in EH in relation to ADCC development covered 111 men aged 45-55 years who had undergone a unified neurological and cardiological examination in 1992-1993. RESULTS: Such factors as disordered circulation along major arteries of the head (a relative risk 3.1 [1.2; 10.3]), thick intima-media complex of the common carotid artery (a relative risk: 5.2 [2.1; 14.3]), the presence of asymptomatic lacunar brain infarctions (a relative risk: 6.6 [2.3; 13.5]) were revealed to be of unfavourable prognostic significance in respect to development of ADCC in EH. CONCLUSION: Some subclinical risk factors may have prognostic value in relation to development of ADCC in EH.
