Two full-term neonates, one with convulsions and intermittent generalized hypotonia and one with poor sucking, temperature instability, and lethargy, are reported. CT scan findings suggested cerebral arterial infarction. Arteriography revealed occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, unilaterally in the first and bilaterally in the second patient. The evolution of the infarct could be followed on serial CT scans. No predisposing factors during pregnancy or delivery were found, and serious neurologic deficits developed in both children. These cases demonstrate that, even in full-term neonates with discrete or moderate neurologic symptoms and born after normal pregnancy and delivery, the possibility of vasoocclusive brain infarction should be considered. The diagnosis is suggested by imaging techniques, of which CT scanning seems to have the greatest value at present. This technique also permits the follow-up of the lesions. The prognosis for neurologic development appears to be variable: minor neurologic deficits as well as unexplained spastic hemiplegia in older children may be the consequence of inapparent cerebral arterial infarction in the neonatal period.
