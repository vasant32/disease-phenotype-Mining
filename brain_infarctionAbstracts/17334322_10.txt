A peripheral origin is typically contemplated in a patient presenting with sudden hearing loss (HL) and dizziness without other neurologic manifestations. Although symptoms of anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) infarction include sudden HL and vertigo, the clinical picture usually shows ipsilateral facial anesthesia or paralysis, Horner's syndrome, contralateral body anesthesia, or cerebellar dysmetria. A 68-year-old female patient developed sudden HL in the right ear and vertigo. A left-beating horizontal torsional nystagmus was observed, and caloric weakness in the right side was noted. Diffusion- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed cerebellar infarction in the right AICA territory. AICA infarction may present without obvious neurologic deficits, and an imaging study is advised in patients at high risk for vascular accidents.
