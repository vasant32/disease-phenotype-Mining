BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is more frequent in migraine patients and is a cause of brain infarct among patients under 55 years old. Our goal was to study the association between PFO and migraine in ischemic stroke patients under 55 years old. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Observational study with inclusion of consecutive stroke patients admitted to a stroke unit (1995--2005). We selected patients under 55 years of age with first-ever acute cerebral infarction of cryptogenic origin. Demographic data, vascular risk factors, stroke vascular territory, stroke severity, the presence of PFO and/or atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) in echocardiography and functional status at discharge by the modified Rankin Scale score were analysed according to previous migraine. RESULTS: From a total of 130 patients, 76 were males. The 13.8% had previous migraine, 3.9% among male and 27.8% among female (p < 0.001). Migraine patients were younger than non migraine ones (p = 0.041) and had a higher frequency of vascular risk factors (not significant [NS]). Stroke severity and functional status at discharge were similar in both groups. Previous history of migraine was associated with FOP (38.9% vs. 26.8%; NS) and FOP plus ASA (odds ratio = 5; 95% confidence interval, 1.422-17.580). The latter association was higher in female (33.3% vs. 0%; NS). CONCLUSIONS: Previous migraine is more frequently associated with double interatrial septal abnormality (PFO plus ASA) in cerebral infarct patients under 55 years of age. This association could be higher in women.
