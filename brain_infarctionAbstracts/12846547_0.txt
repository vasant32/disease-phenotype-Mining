We encountered unexpected accumulation of thallium-201 in a patient with thalamic dementia resulting from bithalamic venous infarction induced by arteriovenous fistula in the posterior fossa The site and degree of abnormal accumulation varied between early and delayed thallium-201 SPECT images. This unexpected and complicated accumulation of thallium-201 appeared to depend on not only breakdown of the blood-brain barrier but also on the hemodynamics of this type of venous infarction.
