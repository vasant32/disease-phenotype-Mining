OBJECT: Nitroxides mimic superoxide dismutase (SOD) biochemically and may prevent free radical oxidative injury in settings in which endogenous SOD is overwhelmed. The authors have previously shown the efficacy of a nitroxide, Tempol, in reducing stroke infarct size. Of the nitroxides, 3-carbamoyl-proxyl (3-CP) is especially promising for clinical use, because it does not cause hypotension in animals. Its efficacy in brain ischemia, however, is untested. The goal of this study was to ascertain whether 3-CP would reduce brain damage in a rat ischemia-reperfusion model. METHODS: The authors performed a blinded, dose-response study of the effect of different amounts of 3-CP (1, 10, and 100 mg/kg) on infarct size at 24 hours after focal ischemia and reperfusion. The 3-CP was given intravenously during reperfusion, which followed 1 hour of reversible ischemia induced by a thread placed intraluminally in the middle cerebral artery of rats. Brain infarcts, measured with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining in six 3-CP groups, were compared with those measured in controls (animals given an equal volume of saline). Edema-corrected infarct sizes (mean +/- standard deviation) were as follows: 146 +/- 64 mm3 in controls; 107 +/- 18 mm3 in rats given 1 mg/kg 3-CP; 40 +/- 20 mm3 in those given 10 mg/kg 3-CP; and 44 +/- 17 mm3 in those given 100 mg/kg 3-CP. A statistically significant reduction in infarct size was achieved in the 10- and 100-mg/kg 3-CP-treated groups (p < 0.01). A reduction in infarct size was also seen in the 1 mg/kg 3-CP-treated group, but this did not reach statistical significance. The authors observed no effects of 3-CP on blood pressure or brain temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Given at reperfusion, 3-CP significantly decreases brain infarct size at doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg without causing hypotension. The authors found that 3-CP is well suited for further laboratory and clinical use in brain ischemia and reperfusion.
