Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been reported to improve neurologic function after ischemic injury. However, the detailed mechanisms by which MSCs promote functional recovery are not fully understood. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a well-known anti-inflammatory cytokine with neuroprotective effects with respect to brain injury. In this study, a non-human primate ischemia model was used to test the hypothesis that transplanted human bone-marrow-derived MSCs (hBMSCs) exert a neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia and upregulate IL-10 expression. We also assessed neuronal apoptosis and astroglial activity in the area around the ischemic lesion and proliferating cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Results showed that hBMSC transplantation in ischemic tissues improved the neurological functions and induced an increase in IL-10 expression. In addition, neuronal apoptosis and astroglial activity in the peri-ischemic area decreased, and the number of proliferating cells in the SVZ increased. These results provide a novel therapeutic strategy for improving neurologic function after cerebral ischemia.
