OBJECTIVE: To evaluate diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) of white matter in prognosis of acute lacunar infarctions. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients of pyramidal tract strokes at the acute phase (<3 days) with a marked motor defect were examined. Lesions were identified on diffusion weighted imaging and isotropic imaging of DTI, and infarctions and the tract were shown on the DTT images simultaneously. The anatomic location and pattern of the lesions were visualized on DTT, with regard of the corticospinal tract (CST), all patients were divided into three clinical subgroups: in Group 1 infarction lesions were close to CST, in Group 2 CST was partial involved, in Group 3 lesions centered in the pyramidal tract. Subsequently, they were compared with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at acute phase (<3 days), early chronic phase (8 approximately 14 days), and outcome(30 approximately 60 days). RESULT: NIHSS scores of Group 1(12/28) were not different with those of Group 2 (11/28) at the acute phase (U=-1.430, P>0.05), and NIHSS scores in Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 3(5/28) (U= -2.676, P <0.01). In the outcome, NIHSS scores of Group 1 were significantly lower than those of Group 2 (U= -2.501, P<0.05), NIHSS scores of Group 2 were significantly lower than those of Group 3 (U= -2.948, P<0.01). Among these three groups,Group 1 all had good recovery, Group 2 also had good recovery but sometimes with some mild motor disfunction, and Group 3 always had marked defect and minor improvement. Both rADC value and rFA value were induced in the acute lacunar infarctions. CONCLUSION: DTT is helpful in prognestic valuation of acute lacunar infarction by providing visualized stereo localization of CST and infarction lesions.
