A comparative study of free aminoacid content in the blood of 27 patients will brain hemorrhages and 32 patients with brain infarctions was conducted during the first 12 hours of brain stroke. A comparison of the data obtained with the results of a study of 16 normals and 24 patients with atherosclerosis and hypertensive disease demonstrated changes in the aminoacids spectrum which is characteristic for a hemorrhagical and ischemic stroke. The differences in the content of 10 aminoacids are shown. The achieved results are discussed in the light of their differential diagnostic significance.
