We studied 12 children (8 female and 4 male) aged 2.2-14.3 years, whose computed tomographic (CT) examination had shown evidence of malacic and/or porencephalic outcomes of early vascular brain infarction. Topographic spectral electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis was performed in all patients in the awake state. The following spectral EEG variables were studied: topography, absolute and relative power of delta, theta, alpha, beta bands, overall power, and peak alpha frequency asymmetries. The results of topographic spectral EEG analysis were compared with the localization and nature of lesions as detected by CT scans. Depending on the nature of the lesions, we were able to identify two different spectral patterns. Porencephalic cysts were characterized by an increase in delta and theta bands in the areas surrounding the lesion sites, as identified by CT. Spectral EEG patterns of malacic outcomes resulted in a focal increase in theta and delta band power, corresponding to the topography of lesions. Moreover, in 9/12 subjects an asymmetry of alpha rhythm in occipital leads was found homolaterally to the lesion sites, associated with a decrease in power, without any CT evidence of an occipital lesion.
