OBJECTIVE: Air embolism to the cerebral artery circulation is a rare complication previously associated with surgery, scuba-diving, induced abortion, angiography, and pneumothorax. However, air embolism secondary to a ruptured air bulla during commercial air travel has rarely been reported. METHODS: We report a patient who became unconsciousness 30 minutes after her plane took off. RESULTS: The patient was found to have an acute brain infarct in a watershed distribution secondary to multiple, bilateral, intraparenchymal air bubbles. Further investigation revealed a large lung bulla with an air-fluid level. CONCLUSION: Air embolism was due to rupture of the lung bulla into the pulmonary venous outflow. Whether the rupture was spontaneous or due to a stretch injury from a change of air pressure resulting in pulmonary barotrauma occurring during commercial air travel is uncertain.
