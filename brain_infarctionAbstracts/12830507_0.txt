Polymorphic variants of genes for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen (ATG) were studied in 110 patients with different types of brain ischemic disease--carotid atherothrombotic ischemic stroke (one of the pathogenic brain infarction variants) as well as in 119 their siblings with the main risk factors of cerebrovascular pathology development being taken into account. No association has been found between ACE and ATG genes polymorphisms and carotid atherothrombotic ischemic stroke. However, the presence of a homozigous DD ACE genotype was shown to be an independent risk factor for development of hemodynamically relevant stenosis of the major brain arteries. The absence of differences in genetic variants distribution in patients with acute ischemic stroke, comparing to those with prolonged chronic brain ischemic disease (without infarction formation) and the highest frequency of this polymorphism in "longevity" group (without lifetime stroke) imply a relatively independent character of the atherothrombogenic process, which may probably underlie a further development of pathological process.
