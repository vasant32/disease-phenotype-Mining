Although animal studies, human neuroimaging studies, and numerous theoretical models suggest possible contributions of the thalamus to working memory, there are very few reported deficits in human working memory following thalamic lesions. The present study examined working memory performance in six individuals with isolated thalamic stroke and found evidence of impairment on a number of working memory span tasks, but not on a forward digit-span measure. Examination of additional aspects of working memory performance (e.g., spatial and object working memory), analysis of subjects with other sites of thalamic stroke, and functional neuroimaging suggest a role of the thalamus in working memory.
