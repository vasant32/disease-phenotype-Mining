Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to map hand muscle representations in the motor cortex of a patient in whom infarction of the sensory thalamus deprived the sensorimotor cortex of sensory input. The threshold for activation of the motor cortex on the affected side was higher and the cortical representational maps of individual muscles were less well defined than those on the normal side. It is concluded that electrophysiological changes in cortical organisation can be demonstrated following withdrawal of, or imbalance in sensory afferent activity to the cerebral cortex in humans.
