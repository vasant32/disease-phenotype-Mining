500 patients who were admitted to hospitals in acute phases of brain infarctions were treated by intravenous administrations of spasmolytical drugs. 518 patients with similar conditions, besides spasmolytical drugs received anticoagulants (heparin and phenilin). In patients with expressed neurological disorders treated by anticoagulants there was a highly significant improvement, including an increase of the percent of moderate improvement and a drop in the lethality, In those patients with mildly expressed neurological disorders who received anticoagulants an improvement was also marked, but not so distinctly. In cases with slight neurological disorders the different outcomes were not significant. The highest effectivesness of anticoagulants was marked in infarctions, due to thrombosis. The effectiveness indices in patients due  to stenosis with angiospasms were not significant.
