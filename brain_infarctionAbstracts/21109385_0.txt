Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is currently the only approved agent for treating acute ischemic stroke. However, rt-PA may cause fatal symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and other adverse effects like bleeding complications and allergic reactions. Patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have increased risk of allergic reactions. This report is about a patient with a history of ACE inhibitor intake who experienced life-threatening anaphylactoid shock during rt-PA administration. The relationship between rt-PA and ACE inhibitor was also discussed.
