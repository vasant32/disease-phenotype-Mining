BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Symptomatic progression is frequently observed in lacunar infarcts. The exact mechanisms of this phenomenon have not yet been clarified. SUMMARY OF CASES: We report 2 patients with lenticulostriate artery infarcts that presented with skip lesions that were restricted to gray matter. One of the patients subsequently developed symptomatic deterioration; the other experienced no further neurological events. CONCLUSIONS: A possible mechanism of differential vulnerability to ischemia of gray and white matter is considered. White matter may have a longer therapeutic time window for neuroprotective treatment than gray matter.
