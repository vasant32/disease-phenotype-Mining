Reported is a case of an assault causing extensive blunt force injuries in which the clinical, radiologic, and postmortem findings were all consistent with death resulting from brain damage arising from the assault. The assailant was charged with murder. Subsequent full neuropathologic (including histologic) examination revealed the unsuspected finding of a widespread meningoencephalitis but no evidence of significant traumatic brain damage. The contributions of the infective process and of the trauma to death were felt to be unclear and a guilty plea to attempted murder was accepted. This case highlights the importance of a full neuropathologic examination, including histology, in cases of trauma to the head, even when the cause of death may initially appear obvious.
