 AIM: To evaluate the value of three-dimensional (3D) whole brain perfused volume computed tomography (3D PBV CT) based on CT angiography (CTA) data in patients with hyperacute cerebral infarction. METHODS: Thirty-five patients who had suffered stroke with anterior circulation within 3 hours underwent nonenhanced CT (NECT) scanning and CTA. Neuro PBV, a 3D software, was utilized to process the raw CTA data and a PBV image of the brain was obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 6 hours after CT imaging. The volume and quantity of the ischemic lesion on 3D PBV and NECT were compared with MR-diffuse-weighted imaging (DWI). RESULTS: The numbers of cerebral infarcts detected by MRI, PBV, and NECT were 40, 38 and 16, respectively. The results of kappa analysis between NECT and PBV with MR were -.0128 and .7622, and a paired t-test analysis for the measurement of infarct volume between PBV and MRI was t = 7.249, P > .05. The lesions that were not detected by PBV volumes less than 4.5 cm(3). CONCLUSION: 3D PBV CT has the potential to assess the full extent of an ischemic stroke at an early stage, whereas PBV is limited to the detection of small infarcts. The 3D PBV CT technique based on CTA data requires no additional radiation exposure or contrast medium injection, and can be performed in a short period of time.
