Oyaksungisan, the herbal prescription composed of eleven herbs, has been widely used in treatment of cerebral infarct in Oriental Medicine. However, the mechanisms by which the herbal formula affects on the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in cerebral infarction patients remain unknown yet. The secretory levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly increased in both LPS and PHA-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from cerebral infarction patients. However, pretreatment with oyaksungisan significantly inhibited the secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory in PBMCs. Also, oyaksungisan induced a significant increase of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in PBMCs. Thus, these data indicate that oyaksungisan may be beneficial in the cessation of inflammatory processes of cerebral infarct through suppression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10 and induction of TGF-beta1.
