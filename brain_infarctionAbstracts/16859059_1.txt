BACKGROUND: Stroke in young adults causes morbidity in this socioeconomically-active age group. Etiologic frequency of ischemic stroke in young adults is different around the world. This study was conducted to determine the causes of stroke in Iranian young adults. METHODS: The study population consisted of 314,000 young adult residents in the Southern Khorasan Province, East of Iran. All the patients with stroke, admitted to Vali-e-Asr Tertiary Care Hospital, entered this study. Demographic data, clinical presentation, and investigations of consecutive patients aged 15 - 45 years, presented with ischemic stroke, were registered in Southern Khorasan Stroke Database between 2000 and 2005. All the patients underwent a standard battery of diagnostic investigations by a stroke neurologist. Etiologic classification of stroke in the patients was made based on the Practical Iranian Criteria. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-four patients (60 females and 64 males) were prospectively investigated during a 5-year period. The incidence of ischemic stroke in young adults was 8/100,000 per year. Cardioembolic mechanism constituted 54% of all stroke etiologies in young adults. Rheumatic valvular heart disease was present in 32% of the patients and caused 2.5 preventable stroke cases per 100,000 young adults per year. CONCLUSION: Rheumatic valvular heart disease is the most common cause and a preventable etiology of stroke in Iranian young adults.
