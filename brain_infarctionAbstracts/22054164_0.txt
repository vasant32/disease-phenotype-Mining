The suture middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model is used worldwide in both academia and industry. However, the variable occurrence of dysplasia in posterior communicating arteries (PcomAs) induces high mortality and instability in permanent MCAO models, limiting the model's application to transient focal ischemia. In particular, high mortality in intraluminal suture MCAO models is associated with the dysplasia of PcomAs in C57BL/6 mice. Optimization of silicone coating length is critical for reducing mortality and generating stable infarct in this model. The aim of our study is to reduce mortality and improve the reproducibility of the intraluminal suture MCAO model in C57BL/6 mice, which have high variation in PcomA dysplasia. Adult male C57BL/6 mice (n=38) underwent MCAO using sutures with various diameters and silicone coating lengths. The occlusion of cerebral vessels was examined by synchrotron radiation live angiography. The morphology of PcomAs was examined under a microscope after MICROFIL(Â®) infusion. Neurological outcome, infarct volume, and mortality were examined within 28 days. Optimizing the silicone coating on an 8-0 suture tip, we were able to reduce the model mortality to zero after permanent occlusion in C57BL/6 and produce stable brain infarct volume independent of the patency of PcomAs.
