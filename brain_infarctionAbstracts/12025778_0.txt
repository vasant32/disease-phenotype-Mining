The neuroprotector properties of cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), an adenosine receptor agonist, were studied on a model of focal brain ischemia in rats (reproducing a clinical pathological process in humans). The model of the focal brain ischemia in rats was induced by intravasal occlusion of left carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, and by bilateral occlusion of both carotid arteries. CPA was introduced by intracerebroventricular injections in a dose of 25 micrograms/kg, 60 min before ischemia induction. The protective effect was judged by comparing the neurological and histopathological disturbances in the control (untreated ischemia) and on the CPA background. CPA injections produced a pronounced neuroprotector effect on the minimum-invasive focal brain ischemia model in rats.
