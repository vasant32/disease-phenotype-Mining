Seven children aged 3 months to 11 years with histologically confirmed interstitial lung disease (ILD) [6 with desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) and 1 with chronic interstitial pneumonitis] were treated with chloroquine, 10 mg/kg/day. One patient, diagnosed late in the course of the disease, died after three weeks of treatment, despite the addition of systemic corticosteroids. Another patient responded to combined therapy with chloroquine and prednisone and had a normal lung biopsy after 6 months of treatment. He underwent surgical repair of mitral valve stenosis and died after extensive brain infarction. The other 5 patients responded well to chloroquine therapy with major improvement in oxygenation within a few weeks and in lung function over the next few months. They remained well clinically and physiologically, including a normal response to incremental exercise, during a mean follow-up period of 9.8 years (range 3.5 to 15.7 years). None of the patients has developed retinopathy or any other ocular complication. Bronchoalveolar lavage was a useful tool for evaluation of the activity of the disease (predominance of neutrophils) in 3 out of 4 patients. We suggest that chloroquine should be considered as an effective treatment in ILD in children. Incremental exercise test may be helpful for routine follow-up and evaluation of the efficacy of a specific treatment.
