We report the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with severe neurologic complications after envenomation by a viper snake. A computed tomography (CE) scan revealed multiple brain hemorrhagic infarcts. Conservative treatment in this case proved to be sufficient and repetitive CT scans displayed a complete resolution of the radiologic findings. Possible mechanisms for the cerebral infarctions are discussed. The mechanism of infarctions in this case was believed to be the vasomotor and coagulation disorders caused by the toxins present in the snake's venom and was one of the reasons that led to conservative treatment.
