 OBJECTIVES: This is a retrospective institutional review of clinical data and radiological findings of cerebral malaria patients presenting to a tertiary centre in India, which is an known to be endemic for malarial disease. METHODS: The present series describes MRI in four cases all of which revealed bithalamic infarctions with or without haemorrhages in patients with cerebral malaria, and this review examines a subset of patients with this condition. In addition, acute haemorrhagic infarctions were also seen the in brain stem, cerebellum, cerebral white matter and insular cortex in two of the four patients. RESULTS: In this series, the patient with cerebellum and brain stem involvement died. The remaining three survived with antimalarial and supportive treatment. No neurological symptoms were noted on clinical follow-up. MRI follow-up was obtained in only one of the three patients (3 months post-treatment) and showed resolution of thalamic infarctions. CONCLUSION: These imaging features may help in the early diagnosis of cerebral malaria so that early treatment can begin and improve the clinical outcome.
