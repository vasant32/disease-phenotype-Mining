We examined the factors that influence frontal lobe function among 119 community-dwelling elderly subjects, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical findings. We interviewed the subjects, and conducted a neurological examination, electrocardiogram, blood test, brain MRI examination, and cognitive function tests. The modified Stroop test and a personal computer version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were used to evaluate frontal lobe function. The subjects with impaired frontal lobe function defined by the modified Stroop test were significantly older, had more lacunar infarcts, and had lower HDL cholesterol values based on a logistic regression model. Among the aged who appear apparently normal, multiple lacunar infarcts are the cause of latent frontal lobe dysfunction.
