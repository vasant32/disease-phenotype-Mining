In the present study we tested the protective effects of netrin-1 in stroke and investigated the potential underlying mechanisms. When we performed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on adult mice, up-regulation of the receptor uncoordinated gene 5H2 (UNC5H2) but not its ligand netrin-1 was detected with RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Injection of netrin-1, 1 day after MCAO, significantly reduced infarct volume at 3 days after MCAO as revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The ischemic cortex was preserved when netrin-1 was continuously administered. Fluoro-Jade and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling staining showed that netrin-1 reduced the number of dying neurons and apoptotic cells after MCAO. Ischemia-induced p53 expression was attenuated by netrin-1. We also tested the ability of netrin-1 to attract intrinsic neuronal stem cells to the infarct area. Both DCC and UNC5H2 were expressed in neurosphere culture and netrin-1 attracted stem cells in an in vitro transwell assay. However, in vivo netrin-1 administration did not enhance the MCAO-induced stem cell migration toward the infarct area. Our study shows that UNC5H2 expression was elevated after MCAO and administration of netrin-1 protected infarct tissue from p53-mediated apoptosis. These data indicate that the p53/dependent receptor pathway is involved in ischemic stroke pathology and suggest possible new stroke therapies.
