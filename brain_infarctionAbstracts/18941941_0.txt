An anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) stroke is characterized by vertigo, tinnitus, and deafness in addition to facial weakness, hemiataxia, and hypalgesia. Sometimes, it can present as sudden deafness with vertigo, without brainstem or cerebellar signs. We report a 55-year-old woman with hypertension and diabetes, showing recurrent audiovestibular disturbance before a typical pattern of AICA infarction, which was initially diagnosed as Ménière's disease. In elderly patients with recurrent hearing loss and vertigo lasting several minutes, lack classic brainstem or cerebellar signs, if they have vascular risk factors, physicians may also consider the potential symptom of AICA infarction.
