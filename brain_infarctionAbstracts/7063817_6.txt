The relationship between motor and sensory functions has been studied in sixteen patients with hemiplegia due to brain infarct. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were recorded in the subacute phase after the vascular accident. Clinical ratings of the reduction of motor and sensory functions were repeatedly performed during a period of six months. The study demonstrates that a relationship exists between the results of the early SEP recording and the degree of motor recovery in the upper limb and, to a lesser extent, in the lower limb.
