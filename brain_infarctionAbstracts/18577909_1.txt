The authors report a case of a combined endovascular and open repair (hybrid procedure) for a mycotic thoracoabdominal aneurysm (TAAA) including its 6-year result. A 72-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, old brain infarction and moderate aortic stenosis was transferred to the hospital because of obstinate fever and back pain, The initial computed tomography (CT) scan revealed giant (TAAA), and from the laboratory findings, the white blood cell and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly elevated 12,400/mm3 and 23.9 mg/dL respectively. Based on the CT and laboratory findings, a mycotic TAAA was highly suspected. After the remission of inflammation, graft replacement with reconstruction of celiac trunk (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) was performed via spiral incision under extracorporeal circulation. two months after the first operation, the patient complained about his back pain again. CT showed a pseudoaneurysm which formed at the distal anastomotic site. A hybrid procedure was deemed to be the most appropriate for such patient who needs a second operation. First bilateral renal artery bypass (ilio-renal artery bypass) were done using the saphenous vein grafts (SVGs). Following bypass grafting to renal arteries, endovascular aneurysm repair was performed with handmade stent-graft which was fabricated using a self-expanding "Z" stent and woven Dacron graft. The postoperative course was uneventful, and follow-up CT showed the aneurysm to have shrunk with no endoleaks. At six months after hybrid procedure, the shrinkage of the aneurysm sac and the patency of the graft to renal arteries were confirmed by a CT scan. A hybrid procedure is considered to be useful and feasible for the poor surgical candidate with severe comorbidities, hostile abdomen and a complex anatomy. The long-term results of this hybrid procedure is considered to be promising.
