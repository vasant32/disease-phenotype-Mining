BACKGROUND: Genetic variation in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in stroke, particularly the small vessel disease (SVD) subtype. Furthermore, there may be two distinct subtypes of cerebral SVD, isolated lacunar infarction (ILI) and ischaemic leukoaraiosis (ILA). METHODS: 300 patients with well-phenotyped SVD and 600 controls were genotyped for five polymorphisms in the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene and eight polymorphisms within the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene. RESULTS: AGT and ACE polymorphisms and haplotypes were no more common in SVD cases as a whole or the two subtypes. Amongst hypertensives only, an AGT promoter polymorphism (-20A-->C), was associated with the ILA subtype (multivariate odds ratio 1.716, 95% confidence interval 1.073-2.746, p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: RAS genetic variants are not strong risk factors for cerebral SVD. The AGT -20C allele may be a risk factor for the leukoaraiosis subtype amongst hypertensives.
