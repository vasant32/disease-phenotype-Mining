BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts. METHODS: From a prospective cerebral ischemia data base the 106 consecutive patients with territorial type cerebral infarcts on computerized tomography were analyzed. The 85 consecutive patients with lacunar lesions served as a comparison group. The association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial types infarcts was assessed using univariate Chi Square tests and logistic regression models. Cardiac sources of embolism were defined as:atrial fibrillation, left cardiac thrombi, valvular vegetations, wall motion and valvular abnormalities, left atrial enlargement, open foramen ovale, septal aneurysm, mitral valve prolaps, and aortic arch atherothrombosis (all findings--except for atrial fibrillation--assessed by echocardiography). RESULTS: Atrial fibrillation was significantly associated with territorial type infarcts (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.01-4.8). This effect was independent of additional cardiac diseases, other cardiac abnormalities, carotid artery stenosis, and patient age. Most likely due to the small sample size, left cardiac thrombi only showed a non-significant trend towards an association with territorial infarcts (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 0.7-12.3). The rate of all other cardiac findings did not differ significantly between the comparison groups. CONCLUSION: Atrial fibrillation and cardiac thrombi showed an association with territorial type infarcts. Other so-called cardiac sources of embolism--except for mechanical valves and bacterial endocarditis which were not represented in our sample--revealed no clinically relevant association with embolic brain infarct pattern.
