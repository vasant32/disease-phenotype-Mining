Brain infarction is one of the most important age-associated medical conditions, and the age-related neuronal vulnerability to brain ischemia is suggested to play an important role. Recent advancements in gene transfer techniques have provided promising approaches to the treatment of brain ischemia. In experimental studies, the ischemic penumbra area can be targeted by gene transfer even after ischemic insult, and post-ischemic gene therapy seems effective in attenuation of ischemic damage in both global and focal brain ischemia. Perivascular approaches of gene transfer to the cerebral blood vessels through the subarachnoid space may lead to prevention of brain ischemia caused by vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Gene transfer to cerebral blood vessels and ischemic brain tissue may offer future therapeutic approaches to stroke.
