We assessed the effect of a novel calmodulin antagonist, DY-9760e (3-[2-[4-(3-chloro-2-methylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-5,6-dimethoxy-1-(4-imidazolylmethyl)-1H-indazole dihydrochloride 3.5 hydrate) in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) permanent focal cerebral ischemia. In experiment I, the left middle cerebral artery was permanently occluded in 62 SHRs. DY-9760e (0.5 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) or vehicle alone were administered continuously i.v. for 6 h, beginning 0, 30, or 60 min after the arterial occlusion. The infarct volume was measured 24 h of ischemia. In experiment II, the effect of DY-9760e on CBF was assessed in 10 SHRs. Administration without a delay resulted in a mean infarct volume of 166.7 +/- 21.0 mm3 (vehicle; n = 10) and 125.1 +/- 31.8 mm3 (DY-9760e; n = 9). Administration with a 30 min delay resulted in a mean infarct volume of 173.2 +/- 32.4 mm3 (vehicle; n = 12) and 143.3 +/- 35.3 mm3 (DY-9760e; n = 11). Dy-9760e significantly reduced the infarct under these conditions (p < 0.05). The administration with a 60 min delay failed to reduce the infarct. DY-9760e had no effect on the CBF. Continuous i.v. administration of DY-9760e reduced infarct volume in a SHR permanent focal ischemia without affecting ischemic CBF.
