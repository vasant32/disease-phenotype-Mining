Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was originally isolated from cardiac atria, and has potent natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant properties. It has been localized in neurons and astrocytes in the cerebral cortex and the white matter. We hypothesize that glial ANP may contribute to the regulation of cerebral blood flow in brain infarction. In order to elucidate this possible role, the immunohistochemistry of ANP was studied in cases of brain infarction and in other cases of brain trauma for comparison. A statistically significant increase in the number of ANP-immunoreactive glial cells (mainly astrocytes) was observed in the white matter surrounding the brain infarction compared with the intact area. No statistically significant increase in ANP-immunoreactive glial cell number was observed in the cerebral white matter from brain haemorrhage, contusion and control cases. Our results indicate that glial ANP may increase in number in brain infarction, and that it may be involved in the regulation of the cerebral blood flow in the infarcted area.
