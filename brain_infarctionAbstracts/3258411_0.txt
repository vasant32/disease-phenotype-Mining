The clinical, CSF, CCT and PET findings in a 14-year-old female patient are reported. CCT and PET investigations demonstrated multiple cerebral infarctions; CSF examinations revealed inflammatory changes. Zoster antibodies were synthesized intrathecally, as detected by an ELISA after adjusting serum and CSF to identical IgG concentrations. Therefore the diagnosis of a cerebral zoster angiitis was made. Diagnostic and therapeutic problems of inflammatory vascular lesions are discussed.
