We investigated the effect of SAS on the long term memory in PD patients and compared them with patients with brain infarction or cataract (control group), respectively. PD patients develop SAS and cognitive impairments more often then healthy people. Since SAS leads to a fragmentation of the sleep structure it interferes with memory. Therefore SAS may be a pathogenic factor of cognitive impairment in PD. We studied 14 patients (7 with and 7 without SAS) with PD, brain infarction or cataract using the LGT-3, which measures the verbal, numeric and figural long term memory. All patients answered subtest 7 of the Wechsler-Memory-Scale at night and in the morning. The saving between the evening and morning measure was calculated. An analysis of variance was performed using the SAS-condition and the different groups as independent variable. A significant difference (p < or = 0.005) of all memory measurements between patients with and without SAS but not between the different groups has been proved with a superiority of the patients without SAS. A significant difference of the influence of the SAS for verbal memory score on patients with PD (pp < or = 0.05) and brain infarction (pp < or = 0.005) respectively and the control group could be demonstrated. Therefore we found a quantitative difference of memory consolidation in PD patients with SAS. The influence of SAS on memory in patients with neurological disease is more pronounced compared to the control group.
