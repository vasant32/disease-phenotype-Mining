The aim of the present study was the comparative analysis of the role of specific hemorheological derangements in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain infarcts with and without diabetes mellitus. Blood plasma viscosity, as well as red blood cells (RBC) aggregability were quantitatively investigated in all patients during the study. Both of the above mentioned indices of hemorheological disorders were significantly higher in the patients with brain infarcts and diabetes mellitus as compared to the control and the group of ischemic brain infarcts without diabetes. During the ischemic stroke, blood plasma viscosity was increased by a mean of 9.2 per cent in the first and by a mean of 17.6 per cent in the second group of patients. As to the erythrocyte aggregability index, it was changed considerably more - by a mean of 113.8 per cent during stroke without diabetes, while in the diabetic patients the RBC aggregability index was found to be increased by a mean of 147.3 per cent. Ischemic brain infarcts in patients with diabetes mellitus were associated with a significant increase of the patients' blood rheological disorders in all the investigated cases.
