Sixteen of 24 Sprague-Dawley rats with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion for 24 hours were subjected to immediate or 8-hour delayed 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining (n = 8 at each time point); the other 8 animals were subjected to immediate or 8-hour delayed measurement of succinate dehydrogenase activity (n = 4 at each time point). The TTC staining was of good quality good in all animals, and the infarcted region could be distinguished easily from normal tissue. There was no significant difference in corrected infarct volume between the two groups (263.8 +/- 43.1 versus 264.4 +/- 54.8 mm3 [mean +/- standard deviation]). The activity of succinate dehydrogenase was not significantly different when normal or infarcted tissue was measured immediately after death or with an 8 hour delay, although less activity was detected at both time points in the infarcted tissue. These results demonstrate that an 8-hour delay of TTC staining is reliable for evaluating brain infarct volume in a rat stroke model and this probably is attributable to the slow deterioration of mitochondrial enzyme activity in nonischemic brain over this time period.
