Severe complications after cervical spine manipulation are rare. As experts for medical treatment errors, we received between July 2002 and February 2004 cases with serious complications in the central nervous system after manipulation. 5 vertebral artery dissections with subsequent brain infarction were registered. In all cases, the patients showed complete persisting remission of symptoms. In addition, a kinematic estimation model was developed to study the possible causes of vertebral artery damage. We were able to demonstrate that material extension is dependent on cervical rotation and the "free length" of the vertebral artery in the upper cervical spine.
