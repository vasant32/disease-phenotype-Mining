The characteristic feature of ischaemic insult was the excess of the majority components of the nucleinic homeostasis (DNA, RNA, DNA-ases) in the blood serum of the patients with unfavourable development of process and the low activity of ribonucleases. This tendency was also observed in patients with insult localization in carotid region concerning the brain infarct in the invertebrobasilar system. At the favourable course of disease the gradual decrease of the nucleinic acids' level and the nucleases activity in the studied fluids were observed.
