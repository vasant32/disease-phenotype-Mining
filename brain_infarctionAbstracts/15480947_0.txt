OBJECTIVE: We looked for the patients who were treated by short leg brace (SLB) in our hospital for the effects on the treatment of stroke. METHOD: Patients admitted to our hospital for the purposes of rehabilitation of stroke and had SLB prescription from October 2001 to October 2003 were investigated. A total of 20 patients (19 men, 11 women) were investigated in this study. Average age was 60.8 +/- 8.60 years old. Diagnoses were cerebral hemorrhage (12), brain infarction (7), and subarachnoid hemorrage (2). There was right hemiparesis in 15 patients, and left hemiparesis in 15. Activities of daily living (ADLs) were evaluated by FIM at admission and at discharge. The difference between these FIM scores was recorded as DeltaFIM. The levels of ambulation were classified into "need help," "need observation," and "self-sufficient." At the same time, the need for walking aid was recorded. To determine the effects of SLB, all the patients were checked for period of ambulation with cane to the prescription of SLB (period A), period of completion of SLB to acquirement of final walking ability (period B), and Brunnstrom recovery stage for the evaluation of motor recovery. Finally, the level of paralysis, the periods of A and B, ADL assessments, and final ambulation level were investigated. RESULTS: At the time of admisison, the average FIM was 73.9 +/- 24.2; average FIM at time of discharge was 98.2 +/- 21.7. DeltaFIM was 24.3 +/- 21.7. The period A was 37.9 +/- 22.7 days and the period B was 36.8 +/- 24.6 days. The final gait performance was need help, 6; need supervision, 11; and self-sufficient, 13. When we compared Brunnstrom recovery stage III and IV patients and Brunnstrom recovery stage II patients, stage II patients had a longer period A.
