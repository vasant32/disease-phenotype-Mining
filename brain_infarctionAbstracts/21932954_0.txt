The Challenge-Stroke study was conducted in Japanese patients initiated on candesartan cilexetil therapy within 3 months of suffering a stroke to investigate the clinical use of candesartan and its efficacy/safety in this therapeutic setting. A total of 869 patients formed the safety analysis set. In total, 79.6% of patients with brain hemorrhage (BH) and 60.2% with brain infarction (BI) began candesartan before post-stroke day 3 and 7, respectively. Baseline average blood pressure (BP) was 152.0/83.2 mmHg in the BH group and 165.2/89.8 mmHg in the BI group; this was reduced to 125.8/75.4 mmHg and 136.3/78.1 mmHg, respectively, at 1 year. The incidence of adverse drug reactions was 6.7 and 8.0%, respectively. There were 12 recurrent strokes in the BH group and 11 in the BI group after 1 year. The risk of recurrent stroke was significantly higher for BH patients with a final systolic BP â‰¥150 mmHg than for those with a final systolic BP <130 mmHg (hazard ratio: 6.807; p = 0.004). Aggressive antihypertensive therapy is currently employed in Japanese patients with acute stroke. Candesartan was safe and effective for BP control in acute stroke patients. Strict BP management may be useful for secondary prevention of stroke after BH.
