Dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenylsulfone) is employed in the chemotherapy against leprosy. Dapsone also prevents neuronal damage induced by glutamate agonists. As glutamate excitotoxicity is implicated in the damage after ischemia, we tested the ability of dapsone to prevent ischemic injury in a model of permanent middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats. Either dapsone (9.375 or 12.5 mg/kg doses) or vehicle were i.p. administered 30 min after occlusion. Rats from the control group showed a permanent neurological deficit after occlusion, while dapsone-treated groups improved significantly. Dapsone-treated animals showed a reduction of 93% (9.375 mg/kg dose) and 92% (12.5 mg/kg dose) in the infarction volume as compared to control values.
