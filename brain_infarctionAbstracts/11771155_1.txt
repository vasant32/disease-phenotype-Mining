In 26 patients with lacunar syndromes, emergence of new lacunar infarctions were identified within 13 days from onset by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images. The identified lacunar infarctions were repeatedly imaged using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence up to 600 days from onset. On FLAIR images taken by 23 days from onset, lacunar infarctions showed homogeneous hyperintensity. On the later FLAIR images beyond 25 days from onset they were observed as heterogeneously hyperintense lesions in half of the patients. In the other patients, lacunar infarctions were observed as hypointense areas with a hyperintense rim beyond 41 days from onset, which indicates cystic transformation with surrounding gliosis. These FLAIR images of lacunar infarction differ from those of dilated perivascular space which is observed as an area of simple hypointensity.
