Endovascular stent grafts (ESGs) for the treatment of aortic aneurysm is becoming popular because it is less invasiveness for the patient. This new modality seems to be especially useful for treating high risk patients, such as those with end-organ dysfunction. In this study we retrospectively analyzed the results of ESG placement for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. From January 1996 to December 1997, six patients with end-organ dysfunction (two with descending thoracic aneurysm and four with abdominal aneurysm) underwent ESG placement. Five of these patients had renal dysfunction, with serum creatinine levels of 2.0 mg/dl or greater, and the remaining patient had hepatic dysfunction with a prothrombin time less than 60%. One of the patients also had severe atherosclerotic disease with a history of multiple brain infarctions. All the patients received custom made endovascular spiral Z stents covered with a woven Dacron (DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE) graft, which was delivered via a femoral artery under local anesthesia. None of the patients showed significant changes in renal or hepatic function after the procedure. None of the five patients with renal dysfunction needed hemodialysis after ESG placement, although the mean preoperative level of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen was 3.4 mg/dl and 42.0 mg/ dl, respectively. All the patients left the recovery room on postoperative day 1. These results indicated that endovascular stent graft placement is extremely useful in the treatment of aortic aneurysm patients with end-organ dysfunction.
