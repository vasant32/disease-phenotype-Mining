OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ratio of each kind of causes in 180 cases of cerebrovascular disorder(CVD) in autopsy. RESULTS: In 180 cases of CVD in autopsy: (1)125 (69%) belong to brain hemorrhage including hypertension 36 cases(20%), vascular malformation 28 cases(16%), hemopoitic diseases and blood coagulation disturbances 23 cases(13%), congenital aneurysm and brain tumor 9 cases(5%) each separately. (2) 55 cases (31%) are due to brain infarction, main of them are caused by embolism 29 cases (16%) and thrombosis 17 cases(10%). Thrombosis related to atherosclerosis has 5 cases(3%). CONCLUSION: In CVD in autopsy, brain hemorrhage is more than infarction, the ratio of them is 2.3:1. More than 50% of cases is due to hypertension and vascular malformation. In infarction, embolism is more than thrombosis, the ratio of them is 1.7:1. Vascular malformation is more than congenital aneurysm, the ratio of them is 3:1.
