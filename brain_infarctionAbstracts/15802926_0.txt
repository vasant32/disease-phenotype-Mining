The aim of this study was to verify the gender difference in sudden cardiovascular death, mainly comparing brain infarction and hemorrhagic stroke. We analyzed 970 autopsy cases from a total of 3,802 nonviolent deaths (448 considered as sudden deaths, 296 undetermined, and 226 non-sudden deaths) including patients aged 30-69 years. All cardiovascular diseases were responsible for 69% of sudden deaths, and all types of stroke for only 14%. The proportions of sudden death for all cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke deaths were similar for both sexes. However, sudden deaths due to all types of stroke (women 20.0%; men 11.1%; p = 0.012) and hemorrhagic stroke (women 15.6%; men 7.9%; p = 0.019) were significantly more frequent among women when compared to men, the main cause being subarachnoid hemorrhage (women 5.6%; men 1.0%; p = 0.011). Hemorrhagic stroke deaths were usually sudden deaths among women.
