Endotoxemia has been reported as a mechanism for the fatal sequela after heatstroke. Subsequent disseminated fungal infection in a heatstroke patient has been also described. Beta-D-glucan, a constituent of the fungal cell wall, is an early diagnostic measure for fungal infection. In a heatstroke case, we examined for the first time levels of serum beta-d-glucan and endotoxin. A 34-year-old man with a body temperature of 43.5 degrees C was admitted in a state of shock. Prior to the development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), a remarkable elevation of serum beta-D-glucan level to 116 pg/mL (normal level<6.0 pg/mL) was revealed on the first day of admission. However, serum endotoxin was not detected when using a method that excluded beta-D-glucan contamination from endotoxin measurement (normal level<1.0 pg/mL). This change of beta-D-glucan level was accompanied by a depressed neutrophil function, especially in phagocytosis of 34% (normal range 70-90%) but not in bacterocidal function (81% versus a normal range of 70-100%). After intensive care including continuous hemodiafiltration, the patient regained consciousness but remained ataxic due to cerebellar infarction, which might have resulted from DIC, and subsequent bilateral fungal oculitis were revealed 45 days after admission. This case report demonstrates the elevation of serum beta-D-glucan but normal endotoxin levels after heatstroke, which may prompt further study to re-examine the serum levels of endotoxin in such catastrophic insults.
