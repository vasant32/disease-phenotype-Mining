The death of neurons after brain ischaemia may be associated with activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and upregulation of cyclins, reflecting aberrant entry of neurons into the cell cycle. Little has been published on the expression of cell cycle proteins after brain ischaemia in man. Well-characterized antisera were therefore used to examine the neuronal expression of CDK2, CDK4 and cyclins A, D1 and E in sections of brain from patients who had experienced cardiac arrest or focal brain infarction, and died 3.5 h to 9 days later. Scattered neurons contained elevated levels of cyclin D1, CDK2 and, to a lesser extent, CDK4, but little or no cyclin A or E. Present findings indicate that brain ischaemia induces the entry of some neurons from G0 into the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and suggest a potential therapeutic role for CDK inhibitors in ischaemic stroke.
