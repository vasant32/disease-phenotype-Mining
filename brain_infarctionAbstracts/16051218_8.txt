Brain injury secondary to hypoxic-ischemic disease is the predominant form of damage encountered in the perinatal period. The impact of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in 7-day-old pups on the high-affinity [3H] glutamate uptake into hippocampal slices at different times after insult was examined. Immediately following, and 1 day after the insult there was no effect. But at 3 to 5 days after the HI insult, glutamate uptake into the hippocampus was markedly reduced; however, after 30 or 60 days the glutamate uptake into hippocampal slices returned to control levels. Also, this study demonstrated the effect of the nucleoside guanosine (Guo) on the [3H] glutamate uptake in neonatal HI injury, maintaining the [3H] glutamate uptake at control levels when injected before and after insult HI. We conclude that neonatal HI influences glutamate uptake a few days following insult, and that guanosine prevents this action.
