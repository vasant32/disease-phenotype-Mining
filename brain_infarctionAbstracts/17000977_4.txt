The relationship between endothelial dysfunction and stroke subtypes is unclear. We prospectively measured brachial flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in 143 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 40 controls. The overall stroke patients had impaired FMD, but only lacunar infarction had significantly impaired FMD vs the controls. Impaired FMD was an independent predictor for lacunar infarction. Ischemic stroke is associated with endothelial dysfunction, which is more conspicuous in lacunar infarction.
