Lacunar brain infarctions belong to the most common causes of stroke and are typically located in basal ganglia with embolic, atheromatous or thrombotic etiology. Lipohyalinosis, often as a result of a long history of hypertension, can also be a cause of lacunar lesions. At present more than 20 different lacunar syndromes have been described. However clinical findings may be variable ranging from clinically"silent" to focal neurologic deficits to cognitive impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging (using diffusion-weighted sequences) generally allows diagnosis in most cases of acute lacunar infarcts and is superior to computed tomography especially in cases of additional leucoaraiosis.
