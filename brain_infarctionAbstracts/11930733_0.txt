OBJECTIVE: To study the surgical treatment of infrarenal aortic and iliac arterial occlusive disease. METHOD: We analyzed 267 patients with arterial occlusive diseases of the abdominal aorta and iliac artery retrospectively. RESULTS: All the patients were treated by surgery including aortic-iliac bypass in 145 patients, iliac-femoral bypass in 40, femoro-femoral bypass in 45, and axillo-femoral bypass in 37. Their total effective rate and perioperative mortality were 96.5% and 3.5%, respectively. Of the 267 patients, 178 were followed up. The patency rate of prosthesis was 82.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Extra-anatomical bypass is a procedure of choice for high-risk patients, especially for those chronic patients with coronary heart disease, hypertension, cerebral arterial atherosclerosis, and brain infarction.
