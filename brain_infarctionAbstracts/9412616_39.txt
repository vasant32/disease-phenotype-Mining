BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enlargement of intracerebral hemorrhage is a major cause of clinical deterioration. Identification of factors that predispose to hematoma enlargement is important in managing patients. METHODS: We selected 186 patients (71 women and 115 men; mean age, 64.8 +/- 12.5 years) with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage who had undergone an initial CT within 24 hours and a second scan within 120 hours of symptom onset. We compared patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 145) hematoma enlargement according to clinical characteristics and laboratory data. RESULTS: By multiple logistic regression analysis (n = 139), interaction of long interval (> 6 hours) from onset to first CT and small hematoma (< 25 cm3) strongly reduced risk of enlargement. The analysis also demonstrated that the following factors independently predisposed to enlargement: history of brain infarction; liver disease; interaction of fasting plasma glucose > or = 141 mg/dL and systolic blood pressure on admission > or = 200 mm Hg; and interaction of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c > or = 5.1% and systolic blood pressure on admission > or = 200 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: A patient examined > 6 hours after ictus who has a hematoma volume < 25 cm3 is unlikely to experience further hematoma growth. Prevention of brain infarction and premorbid management of liver disease may serve to lower the risk of hematoma enlargement. Although it remains controversial whether antihypertensive drugs should be used in the acute phase of intracerebral hemorrhage, poorly controlled diabetics with high systolic blood pressure (> or = 200 mm Hg) on admission also were at high risk of hematoma enlargement.
