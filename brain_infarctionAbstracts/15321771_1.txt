OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects and mechanism of power-frequency electromagnetic fields on lipoprotein metabolism and homodynamic during stroke rehabilitation. METHODS: One hundred fifteen patients with stroke were divided into 2 groups, 55 cases of them were treated by exposure to power-frequency electromagnetic fields, 60 cases were treated as control group. Barthel index and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) were used to evaluate rehabilitation outcome. The lipoprotein and its subclasses, homodynamic parameters were compared at pre- and post-rehabilitation. RESULTS: The treatment group showed a statistically significant better prognosis compared with the control group(P<0.01). The score of Barthel index also increased after treatment(P<0.001). Total cholesterol(Tc), triglycerides(TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-c) levels dropped and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-c) increased significantly. The Tc/HDL-c, LDL-c/HDL-c ratio along with the blood and plasma viscosity decreased significantly compared with the controls (P<0.01). The ratio of stroke recurrence decreased significantly after the treatment compared with the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The power-frequency electromagnetic fields can improve lipoprotein metabolism and homodynamic parameters. It can improve the ADL and FIM of stroke patients, which may have significant implications for stroke patients.
