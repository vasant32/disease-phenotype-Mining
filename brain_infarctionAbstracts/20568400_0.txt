Metabolic syndrome and abdominal obesity are the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. The greater amount of adipose tissue the higher level of leptin, adipocytocin with potential proatherogenic properties. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: was to evaluate the leptin level in patients with acute ischemic stroke and leptin's role in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 45 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 17 cases without CNS diseases, matched with age and gender. In all subjects we examined lipid pattern (cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglicerydes), blood glucose level, blood pressure, BMI (body mass index) and central fat--measured by WC (waist circumference) and W/HR (waist to hip ratio). On the basis of these parameters we diagnosed the presence of metabolic syndrome, according to American Heart Association 2005. Leptin level was measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Ultrasonographic scanning of the carotid artery was performed in every patient to evaluate the CIMT and arteriosclerosis. RESULTS: Hyperleptiemia is more often present in patient with abdominal obesity (p < 0.001) and in subjects with metabolic syndrome (p < 0.01)--the constellation of risk factors predisposing to ischemic stroke. There is no independent association between increased leptin concentrations and glucose levels and presence of hypertension (p > 0.05). Hyperleptynemia is associated with CIMT--an early marker of asymptomatic atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: Leptin can be the stroke manifestation of obesity. There is necessary to further evaluation of leptin's role in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases and its potential role in prophylaxis of ischemic stroke.
