Aiming to detect the most sensitive markers of increased risk of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases HDL, HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterol levels were examined using the ultracentrifugation method in 36 patients with acute brain infarction and 34 healthy subjects of the control group. The results of the study have shown significant reduction of the total HDL cholesterol levels in both subfractions, and especially of HDL3 in patients with brain infarction. This finding was discussed in the light of recent studies of lipid disorders in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular diseases. It has been concluded that further studies of these diseases should be directed toward apolipoproteins.
