Consequences of neonatal cerebral venous infarct can be severe. However, we have identified a series of neonates with unilateral temporal lobe infarcts, suspected to be secondary to superficial cortical venous thrombosis, who have had relatively normal outcomes. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. History, relevant studies, and outcomes for 7 patients are described. Most patients presented with neonatal seizures. Neuroimaging showed unilateral temporal lobe hemorrhage and surrounding ischemic change, which was initially attributed to thrombosis of the vein of Labbe; however, magnetic resonance venogram findings suggest that thrombosis of other superficial temporal lobe veins may also be involved. Seizure control was achieved in all cases. Development and neurologic examination at follow-up were usually normal. We conclude that neonatal temporal lobe hemorrhagic infarct secondary to suspected superficial temporal venous thrombosis appears to have a good clinical outcome. This is surprising, given the dramatic imaging and clinical presentations.
