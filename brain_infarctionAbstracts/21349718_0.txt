Valproic Acid (VPA) in overdose is known to cause encephalopathy with or without cerebral odema, hyperammonaemia, hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression and non gap acidosis. Most of these conditions are reversible. We report a 45-year-old man who suffered permanent disability from the non reversible effects of cerebral odema and infarctions associated with Valproate overdose which would have been aggravated by Diazepam. This patient's presentation emphasizes the role of early detection and therapy of cerebral odema in Valproate and Diazepam overdose.
