As stem cells can regenerate damaged tissue, their therapeutic potential on brain damage has been investigated. In this study, the effects of embryonic stem cell transplantation on brain damage were investigated by using a photochemically induced thrombotic brain damage model. Mice with systemic transplantation of embryonic stem cells expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein on day 1 showed a smaller brain lesion size on day 8 than the control mice. The smaller lesion was accompanied by the increase in the number of microvessels at the border of the damaged area. Inside and around the damaged lesion, no EGFP-positive cells were observed. These findings suggested that embryonic stem cell transplantation reduced the brain lesion through the acceleration of angiogenesis by endogenous endothelial cells.
