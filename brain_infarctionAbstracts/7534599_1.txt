Expression of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) was studied by immunocytochemistry in the rat brain with or without cerebral infarction. In a model of infarction produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, aFGF-positive staining that was not seen in controls appeared in both neurons and macrophages. Positive neurons were distributed mainly in the periventricular region of the hypothalamus. The neuronal aFGF began to be detectable about 24 h after the occlusion. The staining intensity for such neuronal aFGF increased until about 14 days after the surgery, but decreased gradually and was undetectable after more than 30 days. Positive macrophages first appeared on the 3rd day after the occlusion and were persistently seen up to the 7th day, but were no longer visible after 14 days. The present results suggest that aFGF may be involved in the repair processes following brain infarction.
