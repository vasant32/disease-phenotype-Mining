We studied the temporal profile of hemorrhagic transformation in 34 cases with autopsy-confirmed hemorrhagic infarction who died within 15 days following a supratentorial brain infarct, provided they had undergone computed tomography. It appeared that within 4 days, at least 76% (95% confidence interval 39-100%) of 21 cardioembolic strokes had become hemorrhagic. We conclude that if anticoagulation is considered in cardioembolic stroke, such treatment should not be started sooner than at least 4 days after the onset of stroke, provided that computed tomography at that time shows no hemorrhagic infarction.
