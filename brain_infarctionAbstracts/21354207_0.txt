 BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic monitoring of circle of Willis arteries during clot embolization in experimental embolic stroke models (ES) is of major importance to assess their reproducibility and to test new recanalization strategies. We sought to assess the potential of transcranial duplex sonography (TDS) in comparison with laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) to monitor the time of recanalization after occlusion of the right distal intracranial internal carotid artery (rICA) and to predict infarct volume at 24h after ischemia. METHODS: Twenty nine male Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to ES. Right and left ICA, posterior cerebral arteries, and basilar trunk (BT) were monitored by TDS and regional cerebral blood flow was monitored by LDF at baseline, 1, 4 and 24h after the ES onset. Infarct volume was measured at 24h after stroke. RESULTS: Among the 25 rats, 3 died during surgery, 5 did not show any significant brain infarct (failure of the stroke model) and absence of occlusion of the rICA was detected in all 5 rats by TDS at 1h whereas only 4 of 5 were detected by LDF. Among the remaining 17 rats, the recanalization time of the occluded rICA assessed by TDS correlated with the infarct volume at 24h, r=0.70, P=0.0013 by contrast to results with LDF, r=0.11, P=0.55. CONCLUSION: Although both TDS and LDF can be used for in vivo assessment of occlusion in a rat ES model, TDS was more reliable as it allowed more accurate monitoring of arterial recanalization, and prediction of infarct volume.
