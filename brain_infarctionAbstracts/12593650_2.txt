A series of tricyclic indole-2-carboxylic acid derivatives were synthesized and evaluated by the radioligand binding assay and the anticonvulsant effects in the mouse NMDA-induced seizure model. Among them, derivatives of 3S-(-)-4 such as 3a, 3f, and 3g which had certain zwitterionic anilides showed high affinity to the NMDA-glycine binding site. The absolute configuration of 3S-(-)-4 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. In particular, 3g (SM-31900) was found to be a highly active glycine antagonist for both in vitro and in vivo assays (K(i) = 1.0 +/- 0.1 nM, ED(50) = 2.3 mg/kg, iv) and also showed high selectivity for the glycine site. In addition, 3g was soluble enough in aqueous media (>10 mg/mL at pH 7.4) to use for medications by intravenous injection.
