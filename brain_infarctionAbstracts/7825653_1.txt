Though several animal models of ischemic brain infarction have been developed, no animal model of purely ischemic spinal cord infarction exists. In humans, such paralysis often occurs as a complication of aortic surgery. While working on an animal model of cholesterol embolic renal disease, the authors produced an animal model of ischemic spinal paralysis by direct intraaortic injection of cholesterol suspension. With histologic examination of spinal cords of the paralyzed rats, prominent cholesterol crystals were found obliterating the lumen of the anterior and/or posterior spinal arteries. Spinal cord infarction was seen most prominently in the lateral columns and anterior horns, though other areas also were affected. Permanent paraplegia developed in most rats, but transient paralysis developed in a few, followed by partial or full recovery. This model of spinal infarction in nonanesthetized rats can be used to study the pathophysiology and therapy of spinal infarction.
