 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Emerging data suggest that neuroglobin (Ngb) may protect against hypoxic/ischemic neuronal insults. However, the underlying mechanisms in vivo and implications for long-term outcomes are still not well understood. METHODS: Using our newly created Ngb overexpressing transgenic (Ngb-Tg) mice, we measured brain infarction on day 1 and day 14 after transient focal cerebral ischemia and performed neurobehavioral assessments in sensorimotor deficits on days 1, 3, 7, and 14. To test the hypothesis that Ngb may play a role in reducing oxidative stress after stroke, intracellular malondialdehyde levels were measured and compared in Ngb-Tg and wild-type mice. RESULTS: Increased Ngb mRNA and protein levels were identified in Ngb-Tg brains. Malondialdehyde levels in ischemic hemispheres of Ngb-Tg were significantly reduced compared with wild-type controls at 8 hours and 22 hours after transient focal cerebral ischemia. Compared with wild-type controls, brain infarction volumes 1 day and 14 days after transient focal cerebral ischemia were significantly reduced in Ngb-Tg mice. However, there were no significant improvements in sensorimotor deficits for up to 14 days after stroke in Ngb-Tg mice compared with wild-type controls. CONCLUSIONS: Ngb reduces tissue infarction and markers of oxidative stress after stroke. Tissue protection by overexpressing Ngb can be sustained for up to 2 weeks.
