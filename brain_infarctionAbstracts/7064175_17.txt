Between 1967 and 1976, 314 patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) were evaluated and treated. Follow-up has been from 2.8 to 13.2 years (mean 7.8). As of 1979, 55 of the patients had succumbed to cardiovascular disease (28), cerebrovascular disease (9), malignancy (10), and other causes (8). During the follow-up period, 15 patients suffered brain infarction (4.8% under the risk) while 40 had myocardial infarction (12.7%) under the risk). Brain infarction occurred as often in patients with carotid TIA as in those with vertebral-basilar TIA, and was more common in patients under anticoagulation therapy than in those without it (p less than 0.05). Arterial hypertension, heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and diabetes did not increase the risk of brain infarction, but all (except diabetes) increased the risk of myocardial infarction. Combination of TIA with arterial hypertension, heat disease, or peripheral arterial disease increased the mortality (p less than 0.001). A life table analysis of surviving 1, 5, and 10 years gave probabilities of 99 and 100%, 89 and 91%, and 60 and 75% for males and females respectively. In the case of normotensive and hypertensive patients, a life table analysis of chances of surviving 1, 5, and 10 years gave probabilities of 100 and 95%. 94 and 80%, and 76 and 49% in both groups respectively. The result clearly emphasize treating of arterial hypertension, and demonstrate that TIA is not only a warning sign of impending stroke but also that of myocardial infarction.
