Immunohistochemical examinations were carried out in a case of thromboangiitis obliterans. A 26-year-old man developed 4 brain infarctions which could be demonstrated by CAT scan. He suffered from a left-sided hemiparesis, major epileptic seizures, and an ischemic optic neuritis. Immunologic studies supported a diagnosis of cerebral thromboangiitis obliterans (CTAO). The serum anti-elastin titer as well as IgE were considerably increased and a biopsy of the temporal artery showed immunohistochemical signs of an acute inflammatory vessel disease. After the diagnosis of CTAO had been made, the patient was treated with azathioprine and dexamethasone. In cases of young stroke patients, a temporal biopsy is important in confirming the diagnosis.
