Ginsenoside Rd (Rd), one of the main active ingredients in Panax ginseng, has been demonstrated to protect against ischemic cerebral damage in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we aimed to further define the preclinical characteristics of Rd. We show that Rd passes the intact blood-brain barrier and exerts protection in both transient and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. In the dose-response study, Rd (10-50 mg/Kg) significantly reduced the infarct volume on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, and 7. This protection was associated with an improved neurological outcome for as many as 6 weeks after transient MCAO, as assessed by modified neurological severity score, modified sticky-tape test, and corner test. For comparison, Rd was significantly more effective than edaravone and slightly more effective than N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN). In the therapeutic window study, Rd exhibited remarkable neuroprotection, even when administered for as many as 4 h after the recirculation of transient MCAO or after the onset of permanent MCAO. Furthermore, in female rats or 16-month-old male rats, the salutary effects of Rd were also observed. These findings suggest Rd is a promising neuroprotectant and provide support for future clinical studies to confirm whether Rd is beneficial in ischemic stroke.
