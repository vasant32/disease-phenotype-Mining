Bithalamic infarcts are usually attributed to thromboembolism of the top of the basilar artery. However, in some cases, deep cerebral venous thrombosis and thrombosis of cerebral venous sinuses was proved to be the cause. The case of a 47-year-old female with ischemic thalamic and mesencephalic lesions is reported, that was attributed to thrombosis of internal cerebral veins. In cases of bithalamic infarcts, apart from the top of the basilar artery syndrome, deep cerebral venous thrombosis should be taken into consideration. Neuroimaging findings such as generalized cerebral edema, multiple infarcts or hemorrhages, hyperdense appearance of cerebral sinuses or veins and filling defects in the cerebral venous sinuses in contrast-CCT, can lead to the proper diagnosis.
