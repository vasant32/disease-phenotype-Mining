Olfactory groove meningiomas compromise approximately 8-18% of intracranial meningiomas and harbor frequently large sizes when diagnosticated. We report 13 consecutive cases operated on Hospital SÃ£o Paulo and Hospital Professor Edmundo Vasconcelos between 1995 and 2003. These patients were retrospectively studied regarding clinical preservation, surgical results and complications. The patients underwent uni or bifrontal craniotomies. There were nine complete resections including duramater and infiltrate bone and four patients with tumor removal and duramater coagulation. One patient died on post-operative period due to brain infarction and three patients had cerebrospinal fluid fistula that resolved. There were no symptomatic recurrence on the follow-up period of 3.3 years(range 11 m to 8 years). With current microsurgical techniques, these tumors can be resected safely with low morbidity.
