Inflammatory processes play a key, mainly detrimental role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. Currently, HMGB1-induced NF-kappaB activation pathway has been recognized as a key contributor to the proinflammatory response. It has been proved that chronic administration and pre-treatment with statins could protect brain tissue against ischemic injury. However, little is known about the effects of statins in the acute phase after cerebral ischemia. Thus, this study investigated the atorvastatin's protective role and the underlying mechanisms in cerebral ischemia. After middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), atorvastatin was administered immediately. We found that atorvastatin dramatically improved neurological deficits, reduced brain water contents and infarct sizes at 24h after stroke. Moreover, the over-expression of HMGB1, RAGE, TLR4 and NF-kappaB induced by ischemia was significantly attenuated by atorvastatin.
