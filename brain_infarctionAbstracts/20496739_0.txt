OBJECTIVE: To investigate the specificity of the acupoints and related factors on acupuncture effects. METHODS: The rat model of cerebral median artery occlusion (MCAO) was established with thread ligation according to Zea-Longa method. The acupoint group and the non-acupoint group were stimulated by acupuncture with 9 different parameters (marked group No. I - VI) combined by frequency (60 Hz, 120 Hz, 180 Hz) and time (5 s, 60 s, 180 s). The acupoint of "shuigou" (GV 26) was selected for the acupoint group, the fixed point which was at a distance of 10 mm from the iliac crest below the ribs in the affected side. The acupuncture effect was evaluated with the percentage of brain infarct area after TTC dyeing. RESULTS: (1) Acupoint groups could obviously reduce the brain infarction area in MCAO rats. Under 9 intervention parameters, acupoint groups had much more effectiveness tendency than that of the non-acupoint groups. (2) Acupoint group VI was the most effective in reducing the brain infarction area among 9 acupuncture parameter groups. CONCLUSION: (1) Acupoint has specificity effect on reduction of brain infarct area in MCAO rats. (2) Acupoint group VI (180 Hz; 5 s) could significantly reduce the percentage of cerebral infarction area by TTC dyeing.
