Hyperthermia worsens outcome of stroke in patients and also in animal models. In the present study, we tested the effects of hyperthermia in a focal embolic model of cerebral ischemia in rats. Focal ischemic injury was induced by embolizing a preformed clot into the middle cerebral artery. Hyperthermia significantly increased the brain infarct volume as compared to the normothermic controls measured at 48 h following the ischemic insult. Neurological deficits were also significantly elevated in the animals undergoing hyperthermic treatment. In addition, hyperthermia also significantly increased mortality. Our data thus show that hyperthermia exacerbates neuronal injury in the focal embolic model of cerebral ischemia in rats.
