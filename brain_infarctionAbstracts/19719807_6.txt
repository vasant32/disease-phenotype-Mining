OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of patients with an ischemic stroke that received intravenous (IV) thrombolytic treatment, and reasons why patients are not treated. METHODS: A prospective registry of all patients with an ischemic stroke admitted to our emergency department (ED). RESULTS: A total of 286 patients with an ischemic stroke were admitted. Eighty-one patients were admitted within 3 h of onset of neurological deficit, of which 28 received IV thrombolysis. In 25 patients no thrombolytic treatment was given because of the presence of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) exclusion criteria, and one patient refused treatment. No thrombolytic treatment was given to 27 patients because of mild neurological deficit or rapid clinical improvement, and after 3 months all these patients were independently living at home without nursing help. Despite a public campaign to gain awareness concerning stroke, the majority of the patients arrived too late at the ED for thrombolytic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of the patients with an ischemic stroke are admitted too late to receive IV thrombolysis. More needs to be done to increase both public and medical awareness of stroke as a treatable emergency.
