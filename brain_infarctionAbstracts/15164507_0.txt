A 7-year prospective study of 379 hypertensive patients was conducted with primary comprehensive clinical and device examination of the patients in hospital followed by annual control in hospital or outpatient setting. Two groups were formed: with uncomplicated essential hypertension (EH)(n = 263, group 1); with EH complicated by brain infarction (BI) (n = 116, group 2). Overall prognostic correctness was 85.9%. BI was predicted by age, smoking, high intake of salt, absence of regular antihypertensive therapy, non-dipper pattern, low output, atherosclerotic changes of major head arteries, frequent paroxysms of cardiac fibrillation, ventricular extrasystole, abnormal blood rheology. Integral index of the patient condition calculated on the basis of the decisive prognosis rule (data of the primary examination + MI within 7-year follow-up) enables targeted prevention of cerebral complications.
