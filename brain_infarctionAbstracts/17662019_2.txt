We report the rare presentation of lacunar stroke syndrome secondary to single perforator mouth occlusion from radiation-induced middle cerebral artery (MCA) stem arteriopathy. A 30-year-old female had acute-onset right-sided ataxic hemiparesis and dysarthria. As a child, she had a medulloblastoma of the posterior fossa and had surgery followed by cranial radiotherapy. She had no significant vascular risk factors. Acute CT showed extensive bilateral basal ganglia and left thalamic calcification; DWI showed a left internal capsule lacunar infarct; and MRA and CTA showed a 50% stenosis of the proximal left MCA.
