2-[4-[(2,5-Difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), a specific inhibitor of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, exerts cytoprotective action and reduces brain infarct volume after cerebral ischemia. We examined the effect of SEA0400 on vasogenic brain edema in rats. Histological observations showed that radiofrequency current caused brain infarct and extravasation of endogenous albumin in the brain. SEA0400 (3 and 10 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly suppressed the increase in brain water content with attenuation of Evans blue dye and sodium fluorescein extravasation after radiofrequency lesion. The findings suggest that the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger plays a role in vasogenic edema formation after radiofrequency lesion.
