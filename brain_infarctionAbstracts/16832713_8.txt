It has been observed that a cytokine synthesis inhibitor, pentoxifylline, prevents the apoptotic processes taking place in the amygdala following myocardial infarction. However, it is unknown if the cardioprotective effect of A(2A) adenosine receptor agonist, CGS21680, which reduces cytokine synthesis, would lead to such amygdala apoptosis regression. Thus, this study was designed to investigate whether cardioprotective A(2A) adenosine receptor activation reduces apoptosis in the amygdala following myocardial infarction. Anesthetized rats were subjected to left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 40 min, followed by 72 h of reperfusion. The A(2A) agonist CGS21680 (0.2 mug/kg/min i.v.) was administered continuously for 120 min, starting (1) five minutes prior to instituting reperfusion (Early) or (2) five minutes after the beginning of reperfusion (Late). After reperfusion, myocardial infarct size was determined and the amygdala was dissected from the brain. Infarct size was reduced significantly in the Early compared to the Control group (34.6 +/- 1.8% and 52.3 +/- 2.8% respectively; p < 0.05), with no difference compared to the Late group (40.1 +/- 6.1%). Apoptosis regression was documented in the amygdala of the Early group by an enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway activation and Bcl-2 expression concurrently to a caspase-3 activation limitation and reduction in TUNEL-positive cells staining. On the other hand, amygdala TUNEL-positive cell numbers were not reduced in the Late group. Moreover, TNFalpha was significantly reduced in the amygdala of the Early group compared to the Control and Late groups. These results indicate that A(2A) adenosine receptor stimulation is associated with apoptosis regression in the amygdala following myocardial infarction.
