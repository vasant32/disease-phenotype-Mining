Prosaposin (the precursor of saposins A-D) has been identified as a neurotrophic factor in vitro and in vivo. In this study, a novel 11-mer retro-inverso peptidomimetic, Prosaptide D5, was injected i.m. to assess its effectiveness in a rat ischemic model produced by reversible total occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Prosaptide (300 microg/kg, i.m.) injected 3 h after reversible occlusion reduced brain infarct area by 56% compared with a saline group (p < 0.01) at 21 h of reperfusion. A similar injection of D5 6h after occlusion produced a 32% decrease.
