The present study investigates the anti-oxidative effects of D-allose on ischemic damage. Rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h under pentobarbital anesthesia. D-allose was intravenously infused during occlusion and a further 1 h after reperfusion (400 mg/kg). The effects of D-allose on focal cerebral ischemia were examined by measuring brain damage (infarction and atrophy volume) and behavioral deficits 7 days after MCAO. In another set of rats, apurnic/apyrimidic abasic sites (AP-sites) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), oxidative stress markers, were investigated 24 h after MCAO to examine the anti-oxidative effects of D-allose. Brain damage and behavioral deficits were significantly decreased by D-allose administration compared to vehicle. The number of AP-sites and 8-OHdG levels were also reduced by D-allose. Thus, the present study suggests that D-allose has anti-oxidative effects and induces neuroprotection in focal cerebral ischemia.
