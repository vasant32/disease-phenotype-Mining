To assess the clinical features and regional variations in clinical profile of and managements for acute ischemic stroke patients, 14,864 patients with 3 major clinical categories of brain infarction (lacunar, atherothrombotic and cardioembolic stroke), among the acute ischemic stroke patients registered by 156 representative hospitals all over Japan (Japan Multicenter Stroke Investigators' Collaboration: J-MUSIC) during a period of one year from May 1999 to April 2000, were subjected to the study. Data were analyzed in each 7 geographic district (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kinki, Chugoku/Shikoku and Kyushu). As for overall proportions of 3 major categories, lacunar stroke was the most common type (41.3%), followed by atherothrombotic (35.4%) and cardioembolic stroke (23.3%). In Kanto, Kinki and Chugoku/Shikoku Districts, however, proportion of atherothrombotic stroke was larger than that of lacunar stroke, which seemed to correspond to the higher frequency of patients with diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia in these 3 districts. Drug treatments, care and hospital facilities varied among districts considerably. Nation-wide consensus for ideal treatments by each stroke category is therefore needed.
