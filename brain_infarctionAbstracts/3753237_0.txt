Eleven cases of intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH), 9 of which were of hematoma type, were studied morphologically. On the basis of topography 2 main types of ICH were recognized: subcortical-cortical and periventricular. It is suggested, that ICH can be not only so-called the "main focus", but also the result of the blood penetration into the cerebral matter from the subpial and subependial hemorrhages, as well as a complication of the ischemic brain infarctions, including periventricular leukomalacia. The authors outline some criteria of differential diagnosis of ICH with hemorrhagic cortical infarctions, periventricular hemorrhagic (venous) infarction and hemorrhagic leucoencephalopathy.
