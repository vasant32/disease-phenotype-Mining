Ultrasonograms of the carotid artery were compared with the intraoperative finding of atheroma plaque in terms of stenosis, fragility, ulceration and calcification. Soft type, intermediate type and these mixed type plaques were fragile plaques in almost all cases. All hard type plaques were tough plaques. The detection of stenosis and calcification was satisfactory, however that of ulceration was not sufficient. The stenotic lesions frequently existed in bilateral carotid arteries and the intima was easy to become thick even after the endoarterectomy. The ultrasonogram was thought to be the essential study for the carotid artery lesions.
