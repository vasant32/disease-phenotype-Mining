BACKGROUND: Brain infarction secondary to stenosis of the posterior cerebral artery is uncommon. We report a patient with midbrain infarction and symptoms of both Benedikt's and pupil-sparing oculomotor palsy syndromes secondary to posterior cerebral artery stenosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old woman developed diplopia, left ptosis, and right hemiataxia and hyperactive tendon reflexes. Pupils were equal and reactive. Radiological examination revealed stenosis of the posterior cerebral artery and left-sided midbrain infarct. CONCLUSIONS: Stenosis of the posterior cerebral artery may cause only midbrain infarction and may be responsible for Benedikt's and pupil-sparing oculomotor palsy syndromes.
