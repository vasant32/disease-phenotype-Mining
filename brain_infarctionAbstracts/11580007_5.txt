A total of 496 patients were examined for suicidal ideation during the acute hospital period and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months' follow-up after suffering either stroke, traumatic brain injury, myocardial infarction, or spinal cord injury. A total of 7.3% of patients had suicidal ideation during the in-hospital evaluation (acute-onset suicidal ideation), and 11.3% developed it during the chronic 3 to 24 month rehabilitation period (delayed-onset suicidal ideation). Compared with delayed-onset suicidal patients, acute-onset suicidal patients had more predisposing risk factors (i.e., personal psychiatric history and alcohol abuse/dependence) and less social support (i.e., lower frequency of being married). Both acute and delayed-onset suicidal ideation, however, were strongly associated with the existence of major depression and impaired social functioning. These findings suggest that the detection and appropriate treatment of depressive disorders and social isolation may be the most important factor in preventing suicide both during the acute and chronic period following life-threatening physical illnesses.
