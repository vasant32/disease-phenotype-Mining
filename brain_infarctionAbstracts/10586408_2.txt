Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images are magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained with an inversion recovery sequence having a long inversion time (T 1) and a long echo time (TE). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of FLAIR images in brain check-up. 320 healthy adults (229 males, 91 females) were examined with FLAIR sequences of several types having repetitive time (TR) of 7000 msec, inversion times of 1700 msec and echo times (TE) of 110 msec. All studies were performed on a SHIMAZU MAGNEX 100 HP 1.0 T imaging system. FLAIR images were useful in detecting cortical and subcortical lesions near the brain surface, which were unclear in the conventional T 2 weighted images. FLAIR images were useful in evaluation of periventricular hyperintensity area (PVH). Frequency and degree of PVH were increased in aging. FLAIR images were useful in the differential diagnosis of lacuna and perivascular space. In conclusion, FLAIR images were very sensitive for the detection of brain lesions in brain check-up.
