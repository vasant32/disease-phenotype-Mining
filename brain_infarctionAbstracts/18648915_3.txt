Risk factors for the metabolic syndrome (MetS) affect brain function and associate with asymptomatic brain infarctions in healthy individuals. We studied whether MetS risk factors alter cerebral metabolism. Eighteen non-smoking men (36 +/- 6years) were stratified into two groups according to their risk of developing the MetS. Individuals in the Risk group had a family history of type 2 diabetes, were pre-obese, had mild hypertension and higher fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin compared to the Control group with no risk factors. N-acetyl aspartate, choline, total creatine (tCr), myo-inositol, and glucose were studied in the thalamus, frontal cortex, and frontal white matter with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The plasma glucose was 13% higher (p < 0.01) in the Risk group, but the brain glucose levels were comparable between the groups. In the Control group, the thalamic tCr correlated with the thalamic glucose level (r = 0.81, p = 0.015). In the Risk group, the tCr was 17% higher (p = 0.006) and correlated with the fasting plasma glucose concentration (r = 0.78, p = 0.013), but not with the thalamic glucose level. In conclusion, the increased tCr level in the Risk group suggests that a family history of type 2 diabetes together with MetS risk factors alters thalamic energy metabolism.
