Morphological and histochemical investigations of the activity of succinate, malate, lactate, isocitrate, and glucoso-6-phosphate dehydrogenases, and NAD-diaphorase in the central, marginal, borderline and perifocal zones of ischemic brain infarctions were carried out. Deep changes in the activity of the enzymes listed, and peculiarities of this activity in various brain structures and tissues were revealed. A connection between the activity of the enzymes, the duration of the infarction, and the structural and biochemical peculiarities of the affected brain part is demonstrated. A suggestion is made on the pathogenesis of the ischemic infarctions and on the possibility of using histochemical data for the purposes of the pathoanatomic diagnosis.
