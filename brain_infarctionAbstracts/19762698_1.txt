BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We aimed to delineate prognostic variables in Israeli patients with anterior circulation strokes treated with endovascular multi-modal reperfusion therapy (MMRT). METHODS: Clinical and radiological data from consecutive tpa-ineligible stroke patients with large anterior circulation infarcts involving either the entire internal carotid artery or the proximal middle cerebral artery territory were analyzed. Stroke subtypes were categorized according to TOAST criteria. Neurological deficits were assessed with the NIH stroke scale (NIHSS), and vessel recanalization was determined using the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) scale at the end of MRRT. Good outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score (mRS) <or=2. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included with a median age of 68. Thirteen patients died and 17 patients achieved an mRS <or=2 at 90 days. Variables associated with survival on multivariate analysis were admission NIHSS <20 (OR 15 95% CI 1 to 230) and postprocedure TIMI score 2 to 3 (OR 35.5 95% CI 2.3 to 603.9). Variables associated with good outcome included admission NIHSS <20 (OR 9.4 95% CI 1.3 to 71.3), day 1 NIHSS <15 (OR 6.4 95% CI 1.1 to 38.4), and postprocedure TIMI 3 (OR 7.4 95% CI 1.1 to 50.3). CONCLUSIONS: MMRT resulted in high survival and good outcome rates in these critically ill patients. Lower baseline impairment and vessel recanalization increase the chances for good outcome. Our results suggest that the benefits of MMRT may merit further study and could be generalized to centers outside the United States and Europe.
