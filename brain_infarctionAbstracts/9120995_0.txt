Silent brain infarction (SBI) in the penetrating arteries is thought to be one of risk factors for overt cerebral stroke and vascular dementia. Although both Lp(a) concentration and apo(a) phenotype have been reported as risk factors for atherothrombotic infarction in cortical arteries, the roles of Lp(a) in the pathogenesis of lacunar infarction in the penetrating arteries remains controversial. We assessed the importance of apo(a) phenotype as a risk for SBI using a case control analysis. The frequency of low molecular weight phenotype (allele a) of apo(a) was significantly higher in subjects with SBI than in those without SBI. Relative risk for SBI was significantly higher in subjects with allele a than in subjects without allele a. Apo(a) phenotype was indicated to be one of the risk factors for SBI.
