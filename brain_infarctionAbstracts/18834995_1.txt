Isolated facio-lingual hypoesthesia and weakness is rare. We describe a case of isolated facio-lingual hypoesthesia and weakness after a hemorrhagic infarct localized at the contralateral operculum. A 66-year-old woman developed acute onset of facio-lingual hypoalgesia, hypoesthesia, and weakness, with no such symptoms being observed in other parts of the body. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a subacute hemorrhagic infarct in the right frontal operculum, which spread slightly to the right temporo-parietal operculum. (123)IMP-SPECT showed hypoperfusion in the right fronto-temporo-parietal operculum, as detected by MRI, without apparent diaschisis within the brain. Neuroimaging findings for our patient suggested the involvement of the primary somatosensory-motor cortices (S1 and M1) and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), which receive trigemino-thalamo-cortical pathways.
