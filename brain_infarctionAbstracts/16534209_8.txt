The efficacy of thrombolysis in clinical stroke subtypes is unclear. We compared the benefit of intravenous rt-PA in 11 patients with lacunar syndrome with that in 33 patients with a non-lacunar syndrome. Patients were matched by NIHSS score and time to treatment. Although no statistically significant differences were detected in outcome, the benefit was greater in the non- lacunar syndrome group.
