OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare the predictive value of quantitative EEG (QEEG) and the Canadian Neurological Scale (CaNS), in patients with an acute cerebral stroke. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-eight patients were studied with the diagnosis of acute ischemic middle cerebral artery stroke, within the first 72 hours of clinical evolution. Thirty-seven EEGs and clinical evaluations were collected: 13 during the first 24 hours after stroke onset, 9 between 24-48 hours and 15 between 48-72 hours. The QEEG studied variables were: the Z values (maximum, minimum and the Z medians from the 5 nearest points to each one) of absolute energies (AE) from the 4 classic frequencies bands. The clinical scale showed a smaller percent of correct prognosis than QEEG variables. CONCLUSIONS: QEEG was demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the degree of residual functional disabilities after an acute ischemic stroke and showed a higher prognostic value than CaNS when they are performed within the first 72 hours of brain infarct.
