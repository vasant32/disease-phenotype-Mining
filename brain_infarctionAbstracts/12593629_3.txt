OBJECT: A novel postsynaptic antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, CP-101,606-27 may attenuate the effects of focal ischemia. In current experiments, the authors investigated its neuroprotective effect alone and in combination with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in thromboembolic focal cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: Forty-eight male Wistar rats underwent embolization of the right middle cerebral artery to produce focal cerebral ischemia. After random division into six groups (eight rats in each group), animals received: vehicle; low-dose (LD) CP-101, 606-27, 14.4 mg/kg; high-dose (HD) CP- 101,606-27, 28.8 mg/kg; rt-PA, 10 mg/kg; low-dose combination (LDC) CP- 101,606-27, 14.4 mg/kg plus rt-PA, 10 mg/kg; or high-dose combination (HDC) CP- 101,606-27, 28.8 mg/kg plus rt-PA, 10 mg/kg) 2 hours after induction of embolic stroke. Animals were killed 48 hours after the onset of focal ischemia. Brain infarction volume, neurobehavioral outcome, poststroke seizure activity, poststroke mortality, and intracranial hemorrhage incidence were observed and evaluated. Compared with vehicle-treated animals (39.4 +/- 8.6%) 2 hours posttreatment with CP-101,606-27 or rt-PA or in combination a significant reduction in the percentage of brain infarct volume was seen (LD CP-101,606-27: 20.8 +/- 14.3%, p < 0.05; HD CP-101,606-27: 10.9 +/- 3.2%, p < 0.001; rt-PA: 21.1 +/- 7.3%, p < 0.05; LDC, 18.6 +/- 11.5%, p < 0.05; and HDC: 15.2 +/- 10.1%, p < 0.05; compared with control: 39.4 +/- 8.6%). Combination of CP-101,606-27 with rt-PA did not show a significantly enhanced neuroprotective effect. Except for the control and LDC treatment groups, neurobehavioral outcome was significantly improved 24 hours after embolic stroke in animals in all other active therapeutic groups receiving CP-101,606-27 or rt-PA or in combination. The authors also observed that treatment with HD CP-101,606-27 decreased poststroke seizure activity. CONCLUSIONS: The data in this study suggested that postischemia treatment with CP-101,606-27 is neuroprotective in the current stroke model; however, the authors also note that although rt-PA may offer modest protection when used alone, combination with CP-101,606-27 did not appear to enhance its effects.
