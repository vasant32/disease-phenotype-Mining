Children with brain infarction due to traumatic dissection of the carotid artery (14 cases) and vertebral artery (4 cases) were observed. In all the cases of brain infarction due to carotid dissection, history of trauma, immediate typical headache after the accident, development of infarction 24 hours after the accident and the presence of the Gorner's syndrome ipsilateral to infarction allowed definite clinical diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis of infarction due to vertebral artery dissection was more difficult and the diagnosis was established only after neuro visualization. In all the cases, outcomes were favorable. Posttraumatic sinovenous occlusion was observed in 17 children. Clinical features failed to meet a diagnosis of thrombosis, which was confirmed only after neurovisualization. Sinovenous thrombosis was often accompanied with cortical venous infarction and, in some cases, thrombosis spread to the deep cerebral veins. In acute period, fundus haemorrhagies and subdural haematomas developed frequently. There were poor outcomes in cases of venous infarctions, especially in deep cerebral ones.
