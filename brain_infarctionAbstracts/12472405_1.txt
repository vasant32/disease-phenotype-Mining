A 72-year-old man with a history of brain infarction presented with left sided anterior chest pain secondary to a thymic carcinoma. He received induction radiotherapy, 45 Gy. Preoperative computed tomography showed the tumor was adherent to a thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) which had extensive mural thrombus and calcification. To obtain adequate exposure without exerting tension on the fragile aneurysmal wall, ribs were resected to allow us to separate the tumor from the TAA, after which median sternotomy was performed uneventfully, creating generous exposure. The tumor had invaded the sternum, ribs, innominate vein, phrenic and recurrent laryngeal nerves, and lung. The tumor was removed en bloc, and the chest wall was reconstructed. Intra- and post-operative brain infarction and rupture of the TAA were avoided. The patient is alive and well without recurrence 10 months after surgery.
