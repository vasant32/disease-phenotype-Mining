The aim of this study was to compare risk factors and concomitant potential cardioembolic sources detected by transthoracic (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in patients with lacunar and nonlacunar infarcts. Clinical data of 139 patients with a first episode of ischemic stroke who underwent both TTE and TEE were analysed. Patients were divided into two groups, lacunar (LACI=36), and nonlacunar infarcts (NLACI=103); then the latter group was divided into two subgroups, anterior (ACI=76) and posterior circulation infarct (POCI=27). Presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were not significantly different between LACI and NLACI groups. The rate of potential cardioembolic risk factors detected by echocardiography was similar in the NLACI groups. At least one potential cardiac source of embolism was identified in 44% (n=16) of LACI, 52.6% (n=40) of ACI and 55.5% (n=15) of POCI patients. Atrial fibrillation was significantly frequent in the ACI group. No significant differences were found between all groups regarding age, sex, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. Our findings demonstrate that hypertension and diabetes mellitus are equally important in the pathogenesis of both LACI and NLACI groups and there is a need for careful cardiac evaluation in cases even with lacunar infarct.
