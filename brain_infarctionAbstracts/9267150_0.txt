This study was done to clarify the relationship between asymptomatic brain infarcts and risk factors for atherogenis. A total of 312 patients (151 men and 161 women) who had no neurologic deficits were enrolled. Their ages ranged from 41 to 83 years (mean age 63 years). The patients were divided into two groups: 158 patients without asymptomatic brain infarct and 154 patients with at least one asymptomatic brain infarct of at least 5 mm as diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. The patients with asymptomatic brain infarct were more likely than those without asymptomatic brain infarct to be 65 years old or older, and to have essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or atrial fibrillation. Among patients with hypertension the frequency of left ventricular hypertrophy or hypertensive ocular findings (Scheie's class H2) was significantly higher in those with asymptomatic brain infarct than in those without asymptomatic brain infarct. These results indicate that aging, essential hypertension (especially with left ventricular hypertrophy or hypertensive ocular findings), diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation are associated with asymptomatic brain infarct.
