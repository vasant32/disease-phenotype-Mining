D-Serine, formed from L-serine by serine racemase (SR), is a physiologic coagonist at NMDA receptors. Using mice with targeted deletion of SR, we demonstrate a role for D-serine in NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxicity and stroke. Brain cultures of SR-deleted mice display markedly diminished nitric oxide (NO) formation and neurotoxicity. In intact SR knock-out mice, NO formation and nitrosylation of NO targets are substantially reduced. Infarct volume following middle cerebral artery occlusion is dramatically diminished in several regions of the brains of SR mutant mice despite evidence of increased NMDA receptor number and sensitivity.
