The serum uric acid level has been determined in 300 patients, both males and females. 125 of these suffered from transient cerebral ischaemic attacks and 175 from atherothrombotic brain infarction. The values obtained were compared with those determined, with the same technique, in a control group of patients with neurologic diseases, chosen at random, and with no clinical finding or historical data of cerebrovascular and/or cardiac disease. No significant statistical difference has been observed between the mean serum uric acid level in the patients with transient ischaemic attacks, or brain infarction, and the control group. All the patients examined were divided according to sex and age. As far as sex was concerned, males suffering from cerebral transient or completed focal ischaemia, had on average a lower serum uric acid level compared to the control group. The opposite happened with females. As far as age was concerned, significantly high serum uric acid levels, compared to the control group, were observed in women with either transient ischaemic attacks or brain infarction, but only in those whose age range was between 50 and 60. In conclusion, from this study, hyperuricemia does not appear to be a high risk factor in ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases.
