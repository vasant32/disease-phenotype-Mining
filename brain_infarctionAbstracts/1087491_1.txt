In a case of fatal cerebral embolic infarction following aorto-coronary bypass graft (ACBG) surgery, postmortem examination revealed thrombosis of the vein grafts to the left circumflex and left anterior descending coronary arteries. Continguous with the thrombus in the graft to the circumflex artery was thrombotic material adherent to the aortic sutures and extending several millimeters into the lumen of the aorta. A nonadherent thrombus of similar histologic character was found in the right middle cerebral artery, associated with localized brain infarction. In addition to the risks of cerebral complication associated with other types of open-heart surgery, the location of the vein grafts in patients undergoing ACBG operations seems to offer a unique mechansim for the occurrence of systemic and cerebral embolism, which may be operational in other cases.
