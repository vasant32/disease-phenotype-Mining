INTRODUCTION: The onset of epileptic seizures after 20 years old (late onset epilepsy) explains 20 to 25% of epileptic patients. The etiology is diverse and includes neurocysticercosis, brain tumors, brain infarcts, etc. Approximately 50% of these patients will have structural brain damage as a cause of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective study of 130 adult patients with adult onset of epilepsy after 20 years old, studies since February 1989 to June 1997. All the patients had CT scan of brain, and when necessary brain magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: We found structural brain lesion in 51% of patients. The most frequent cause of seizures was neurocysticercosis (28%) followed by cerebral infarct (11%) and brain atrophy (11%). CONCLUSIONS: In our area the most frequent cause of adult onset epilepsy is neurocysticercosis. Due to the high probability of structural brain lesion, all the patients with late onset epilepsy must have brain CT scan examination.
