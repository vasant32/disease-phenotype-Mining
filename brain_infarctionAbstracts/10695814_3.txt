The applications of a new segmentation software, Anatomatic, in the evaluation of volumetric measurements of brain infarctions and the new Medimag 3D software in the evaluation of 3D image representation of infarctions are described. These programs are applied to magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of these software packages in making accurate volumetric measurements in 40 patients with right cerebral infarctions, in determining the correlations between the quantitated lesions and neurological/neuropsychological dysfunctions and in creating realistic 3D views of the infarctions. Using Anatomatic, reproducible infarction volumes were achieved with ease and within a reasonably fast time. Medimag helped achieve realistic 3D representations of the infarctions. When compared, the semiautomatic segmentation proved to be much faster and yielded higher infarction volumes than the manual segmentation technique. Significantly positive correlations between the infarction volumes and neurological dysfunctions and neuropsychological deficit (neglect) helped to explain the effect of volumes on the clinical status of the patients.
