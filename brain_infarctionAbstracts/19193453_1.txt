Among 95 patients with Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy, left ventricular (LV) apical thrombus was documented in 5 (5.3%) patients. The thrombus was mural in 2 (40%), and protruding in 3 (60%) patients. In 4 patients, LV apical thrombus disappeared after anticoagulant therapy. In one patient with protruding thrombus, brain infarction occurred. LV dysfunction was resolved during follow-up in all patients.
