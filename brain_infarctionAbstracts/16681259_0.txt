We analysed retrospectively 15 consecutive patients with cerebral infarction undergoing decompressive craniectomy. Ninety-three percent of patients survived, and 53% of them were partially dependent (Barthel Index > 0). We defined the partially dependent patients as good outcome group, and totally dependent as poor outcome group. In good outcome group, compared with poor outcome group, there are more frequent left hemispheric lesion (50%: 0%, p = 0.029), and pre-operative JCS < or = II-30 (62.5%: 14.3%, p = 0.057). Although many patients were severely disabled, 79% of the patients and their family answered that having operation was correct choice. All the patients in good outcome group acquired the ability of oral feeding and communication skill. 87.5% of the patient in good outcome group was satisfied with the outcome. Based on these results, we emphasized that comprehensive evaluations, including satisfaction scale and QOL assessment necessary to decide the indication of decompressive craniectomy for ischemic stroke.
