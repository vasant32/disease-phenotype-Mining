BACKGROUND: Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is commonly caused by hemorrhagic colitis with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O-157. Central nervous system (CNS) involvements, including seizures, encephalopathy and brain infarction, are serious complications, but there are no useful scores for the prediction of CNS complications. METHODS: Routine laboratory data at onset of HUS were re-evaluated in 14 patients to find useful parameters for the prediction of CNS complication. RESULTS: Serum sodium and total protein were significantly lower and C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell counts were significantly higher in patients with CNS complications than in patients without. A cumulated score, SCWP score (sodium, CRP, white blood cell count, and total protein) discriminated better between patients with/without CNS complications than individual values. CONCLUSIONS: SCWP score would be useful for prediction of CNS complications.
