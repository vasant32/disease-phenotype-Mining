Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a recent proven effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke patients. However, the use of t-PA in some special settings is controversial. One of these is the presence of a cardiac thrombus, given that the use of t-PA could potentially accelerate breakup of the thrombus and cause additional embolisms. The authors describe the case of a cardiological patient with a cardiac thrombus who was given IV t-PA for acute stroke treatment without complications. We discuss the necessity or not of a 24 hours delay before anticoagulants administration in these special patients.
