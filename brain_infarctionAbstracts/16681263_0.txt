Fatality rates and the number of patients suffering from the after sequelae of bacterial meningitis have still remained high despite the development of new antibiotics. Cerebrovascular complications have been reported less frequently in adult cases than in child cases. We experienced 3 consecutive cases of bacterial meningitis in adults complicated by brain infarction. Primary causative organism were the Group B Streptococci in one case and the Streptococcus pneumoniae in other two cases. MRI, especially with FLAIR method and of coronal view, disclosed abnormal intensity areas near the brain surface. Conventional angiography and MR-angiography in the two cases showed tapering and stenosis of arteries. These cases suggest that routine use of MRI/ MRA in bacterial meningitis reveal neuro-vascular complications more frequently and easily. The benefits of adjunctive steroid therapy in the treatment of bacterial meningitis might be beneficial to suppression of these neurovascular complication cased by inflammatory vasculitis.
