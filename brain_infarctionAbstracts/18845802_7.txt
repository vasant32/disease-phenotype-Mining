Backgrounds and Purpose- The authors evaluated the incidence of rupture of unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysm during observation. METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2006, a total of 419 patients with 529 unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms were observed without treatment. The mean follow-up duration was 905.3 days. Aneurysm size was measured by 3-dimensional CT angiography. Clinical and 3-dimensional CT angiography follow-up were obtained every 6 months. RESULTS: Nineteen aneurysms ruptured during observation resulting in a 1.4% rupture rate per year. A history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 7.3; 95% CI, 2.5 to 21.2), posterior circulation aneurysm (hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 8), and large size were significant independent predictors for aneurysm rupture. CONCLUSIONS: Size, history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and posterior circulation aneurysms were significant risk factors for prediction of rupture of unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms.
