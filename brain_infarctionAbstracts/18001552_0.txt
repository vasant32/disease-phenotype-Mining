OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical significance of D-dimer detection in the diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic diseases. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 156 patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI), 38 patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and 148 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), all under relevant treatment, and 170 healthy examinees. The level of plasma D-dimer was detected by ELISA before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The positive rates of plasma D-dimer of the ACI, DVT, and AMI patients before treatment were 59.3%, 100.0%, and 61.7% respectively, all significantly higher than that of the health examinees (4.3%, all P < 0.01). And the positive rates of plasma D-dimer decreased rapidly after treatment in the patients of these 3 groups who responded magnificently to thrombolysis treatment (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Increased in most thrombotic patients, the plasma D-dimer level helps diagnose thrombotic diseases early and reflect the efficacy of thrombolysis treatment.
