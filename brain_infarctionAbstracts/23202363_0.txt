 OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs play a role in atherosclerosis-related diseases, such as cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease. However, the effect of miR-146a, miR-149, miR-196a2, and miR-499 polymorphisms on stroke and silent brain infarction (SBI) susceptibility has not been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA, microRNA polymorphisms were analyzed in 678 patients with ischemic stroke, 373 patients with SBI, and 553 control subjects. The miR-146aC>G polymorphism and miR-146aG/-149T/-196a2C/-499G allele combination was significantly associated with ischemic stroke prevalence. For SBI prevalence, there were no statistically significant genetic markers. However, some allele combinations were associated with increased SBI incidence (C-T-C-G and G-T-T-A of miR-146a/-149/-196a2/-499). In subgroup analyses, miR-146aC>G increased stroke risk in female, normotensive, and nondiabetic groups. There were significant combined effects between microRNA polymorphisms and homocysteine/folate levels on ischemic stroke and SBI prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The miR-146aG allele and miR-146aG/-149T/-196a2C/-499G allele combination were associated with ischemic stroke pathogenesis. The combined effects between microRNA polymorphisms and homocysteine/folate levels may contribute to stroke and SBI prevalence.
