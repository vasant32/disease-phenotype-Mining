Balint syndrome is a disorder of inaccurate visually guided saccades, optic ataxia, and simultanagnosia that typically results from bilateral parieto-occipital lesions. Visual perception disturbances in the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) include hemianopia, visual neglect, and cerebral blindness, but Balint syndrome had not been recognized. We report Balint syndrome associated with PRES in a 37-year-old woman with acute hypertension and systemic lupus erythematosus. Balint syndrome can be an initial presentation of PRES.
