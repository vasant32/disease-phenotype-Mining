The role of generalized hypoxia-ischemia in the genesis of perinatal focal arterial stroke remains puzzling. Animal studies have demonstrated that hypoxia-ischemia may alter blood flow through the ductus venosus, thereby increasing the risk for placental emboli entering the cerebral circulation. A retrospective review was performed of clinical records of all term newborns admitted to a tertiary perinatal center between January 1995 and May 2007 with acute arterial stroke on neuroimaging during the first week of life. Newborns were classified into 2 groups on the basis of neuroimaging abnormalities: stroke alone, or stroke and nonfocal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. A total of 62 newborns had focal or multifocal stroke, 36 with stroke alone and 26 with stroke with nonfocal hypoxia-ischemia. Multiple risk factors for hypoxia-ischemia occurred in most newborns in both groups. These data indicate that hypoxia-ischemia may play a role in the genesis of stroke in the term newborn with or without evidence of nonfocal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury on neuroimaging.
