Rotational vertebral artery (VA) occlusion can cause ischemic strokes due to hemodynamic insufficiency and possibly artery-to-artery (A-to-A) embolism. The former is known as bow hunter's stroke. The latter has been proposed only from indirect evidence. We have described a 7-year-old boy with cerebral infarction associated with A-to-A embolism due to repetitive rotational VA occlusion. He had a mobile mural thrombus at the VA occlusion site on head rotation. Surgical treatment may effectively prevent recurrences.
