Recognition of childhood stroke is difficult. Newer diagnostic modalities like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have made this task much easier. Head trauma usually causes hemorrhage. We are presenting seven cases of mild head injury presenting as ischamic stroke. Neuroimaging suggested infarct involving left basal ganglia and internal capsule in five and bilateral involvement in two cases. MRA done in three was normal.
