OBJECTIVE: We describe the CT and MR imaging findings of the brain in patients who inadvertently poisoned themselves with concentrated hydrogen peroxide. Thirty-five percent hydrogen peroxide is commercially available as an oxidant and disinfectant. This solution is currently sold and promoted in health food stores in the United States as a means of "improving oxygenation" in people with coronary artery disease and other health problems. CONCLUSION: Our findings show the high toxicity of concentrated hydrogen peroxide. CNS damage and death are likely consequences after ingestion of this agent.
