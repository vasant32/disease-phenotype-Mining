 BACKGROUND: Whether migraine is associated with a higher prevalence of hypercoagulable states (HS) in ischemic stroke patients is unknown. METHODS: This was a prospective study of patients under 55 years of age with brain ischemia. A systematic questionnaire addressed the antecedent of migraine with aura (MA) or without aura (MO). We investigated the presence of HS by an extensive battery of haematological tests. The presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) was assessed by trans-oesophageal echocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 154 patients (95 men; mean ± SD age, 44.12 ± 8.4 years) were included; 44 had migraine, 15 had MA. HS were more frequent in the migraine than non-migraine group (38.6% vs. 16.4%, p < 0.01). The multivariate analysis showed that MO was associated with a 2.88-fold (95% CI, 1.14 to 7.28) increased risk of HS diagnosis. However, in the group of patients with brain infarction under 50 years old, MA, but not MO, was independently associated with HS (OR 6.81; 95% CI, 1.01 to 45.79). CONCLUSION: In young patients with ischemic stroke, migraine may be associated with a higher frequency of HS.
