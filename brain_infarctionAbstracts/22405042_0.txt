In a population-based study of 3962 community-dwelling nondemented elderly we investigated the relation of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and the presence of infarcts with cerebellar volume, and its interrelationship with cerebral volumes. Cerebellar and cerebral gray and white matter were segmented using Freesurfer version 4.5 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). We used linear regression analyses to model the relationship between age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, brain infarcts, white matter lesions (WMLs) and cerebellar and cerebral volume. Smaller cerebellar volumes with increasing age were mainly driven by loss of white matter. Diabetes, higher serum glucose and lower cholesterol levels were related to smaller cerebellar volume. No association was found between hypertension, smoking, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, and cerebellar volume. Supratentorial lacunar infarcts and WMLs were related to smaller cerebellar volume. Infratentorial infarcts were related to smaller cerebellar white matter volume and total cerebral volume. This study suggests that determinants of cerebellar volume do not entirely overlap with those established for cerebral volume. Furthermore, presence of infarcts or WMLs in the cerebrum can affect cerebellar volume.
