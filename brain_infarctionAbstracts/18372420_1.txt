Electrical injuries are becoming more common and are increasingly imaged with advanced technologies, such as MR imaging. However, the MR imaging findings of such injuries remain largely unstudied. We report a high-voltage electrical injury to the cerebral corticospinal tracts and document evolution on serial MR images.
