OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation of serum apolipoprotein H (ApoH) with blood lipids and the relationship between ApoH and stroke. METHODS: The serum levels of ApoH of 33 patients with acute cerebral infarction (ACI), 18 patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage (ACH), 17 patients with cerebral apoplexy and family history, and 33 healthy control were measured by radioimmunoassay. The blood lipids of the above mentioned subjects were measured by enzymological methods. RESULTS: The serum ApoH levels in acute cerebral infarction (ACI) patients, acute cerebral hemorrhage (ACH) patients, and healthy controls were 288 +/- 85 mg/L, 248 +/- 68 mg/L, and 256 +/- 71 mg/L respectively. There was a significant correlation between serum ApoH and total CHO and between ApoH and LDL in ACI patients (r = 0.394, P < 0.05; r = 0.394, P < 0.05). However, no correlation between ApoH and triglyceride was found. In 17 cases of cerebral apoplexy with familial history, the serum ApoH was correlated with HDL. CONCLUSION: Serum ApoH is correlated with CHO and LDL in ACI patients. No such correlation can be found in healthy persons and ACH patients.
