MRI equipment with a magnet having a field strength of 7 Tesla (7-T) has been in use for several years at the University Medical Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands. 7-Tesla MR imaging provides new opportunities for imaging the brain and its vasculature. The enhanced resolution and the possibilities for angiography of the smallest cerebral vessels without using contrast media are particularly of interest for patients with cerebral small-vessel disease. Microthrombi may be visualised in the perforating cerebral arteries in patients with a lacunar infarct. This technique could have a considerable impact on the classification of several types of lacunar infarcts and could lead to better customised therapies.
