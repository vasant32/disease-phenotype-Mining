OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the location of subcortical silent infarcts differs from that of symptomatic lacunar infarcts. METHODS: 32 silent infarcts and 59 acute lacunar infarcts located in the corona radiata were examined. The relative anterior-to-posterior locations of the silent infarcts in the corona radiata were compared with those of the symptomatic lacunes on T2-weighed MR imaging. RESULTS: The locations of the silent infarcts differed from those of the symptomatic lacunar lesions in the corona radiata (p<0.001). Silent infarcts were distributed principally in the anterior half of the corona radiata, whereas most of the symptomatic lacunes were located in the posterior half of the corona radiata. CONCLUSION: The asymptomatic nature of subcortical silent infarcts may be attributable to their location in ineloquent portions of brain structures.
