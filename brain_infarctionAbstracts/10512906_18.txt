BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine the relations between infarct subtype and white matter hyperintensities (WMHIs) on MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 395 ischemic stroke patients with 1. 0-T MRI. The number of lacunar, border-zone, and cortical infarcts was registered. WMHIs were analyzed in 6 areas. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to find the risk factors for different infarct subtypes and to study the connections between WMHIs and brain infarcts. RESULTS: Lacunar infarcts were associated with hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% CI, 1.17 to 2.73), alcohol consumption (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.17 to 3.28), and age (OR, 1. 03; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.06). Border-zone infarcts were associated with carotid atherosclerosis (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 4.19). Atrial fibrillation (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.66 to 5.50) and carotid atherosclerosis (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.36) were independent positive predictors, and history of hyperlipidemia (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.75) and migraine (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.93) were negative predictors for cortical infarcts. Patients with lacunar infarcts had more severe WMHIs than patients with nonlacunar infarcts in all WM areas (P</=0.001). Patients with border-zone infarcts showed severe periventricular lesions (P=0.002), especially around posterior horns (P=0.003). The extent of WMHIs in patients with cortical infarcts did not differ from that in those without cortical infarcts. CONCLUSIONS: Various infarct subtypes have different risk profiles. The association between lacunar infarcts and WMHIs supports the concept of small-vessel disease underlying these 2 phenomena. The connection between border-zone infarcts and periventricular WMHIs again raises the question of the disputed periventricular vascular border zone.
