BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is no acute therapy proven to be of benefit for ischemic stroke. Ancrod is a potentially effective therapy because of the advantageous consequences of fibrinogen lowering. METHODS: We studied the safety and efficacy of ancrod in patients with acute ischemic stroke administered within 6 hours of stroke onset. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial 64 patients received intravenous ancrod and 68 received placebo for 7 days. Neurological outcome, disability, and brain infarct volume were measured. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in overall mean scores on the Scandinavian Stroke Scale. No increase in bleeding occurred in the ancrod-treated patients. The target reduction of plasma fibrinogen levels of less than 100 mg/dL was achieved in only 15 (23%) of 64 ancrod-treated patients. Those patients with ancrod-induced 6-hour fibrinogen levels 130 mg/dL or less had a marginally significantly better neurological outcome on the Scandinavian Stroke Scale, mortality, and Barthel Index than ancrod-treated patients with higher fibrinogen levels. CONCLUSIONS: Ancrod appears safe and potentially effective when administered to patients within 6 hours of onset of ischemic stroke.
