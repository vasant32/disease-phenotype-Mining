We present a case of homozygous protein C deficiency with neonatal purpura fulminans and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) starting shortly after birth. In addition, the infant had vitreal eye hemorrhages and intraparenchymal brain infarction, apparently as intrauterine events. Within 15 hours of institution of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusions the DIC resolved and the progression of purpura fulminans reversed. Warfarin (0.4 mg/kg/day) was started on the fifth day of life, followed by gradual tapering of the FFP infusions. There were no recurrences of purpura, areas of skin necrosis healed without the need for skin grafting, and the areas of brain infarction resolved without apparent sequelae. The eye and brain lesions may be intrauterine events and appear to be a regular feature of this syndrome. Family studies are essential to establish the diagnosis, although there may be no family history of thromboembolic events, as in this case. Homozygous protein C deficiency is a rare disorder, but one in which early recognition and intervention may be lifesaving. Ours is the youngest patient yet reported to be treated with warfarin anticoagulation. We were thus able to avoid the complications of long-term plasma therapy as well as the potential thrombotic complications of central venous catheter placement.
