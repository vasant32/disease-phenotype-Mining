We studied a clinical significance of hypertension and diabetes mellitus between silent brain infarction and symptomatic brain infarction. History of hypertension was present in 50% of silent infarction and in 53.3% of symptomatic infarction. Untreated hypertension was more frequent in symptomatic infarction than silent infarction (28.3% vs 16.7%) and the control of the blood pressure was very poor even if the patients with symptomatic infarction was treated with antihypertensive drugs. 66.7% of silent infarction with hypertension was treated with antihypertensive therapy and the control of the blood pressure was also relatively good. In the population with silent infarction, good control of the blood pressure was important for the prevention of symptomatic infarction. Diabetes mellitus with long history was strongly related to symptomatic infarction as compared with silent infarction. The prevalence of both hypertension and diabetes mellitus was high in the population with symptomatic infarction as compared with silent infarction and control individual.
