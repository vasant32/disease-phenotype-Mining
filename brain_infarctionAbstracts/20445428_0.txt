BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether hemostasis plays a role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke subtypes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the possible relationship between different hemostatic markers and lacunar stroke. RESULTS: The study consisted of 30 patients with symptomatic lacunar stroke and 30 healthy age-matched healthy individuals. We analyzed the values of "Mean Platelet Volume," D-dimer, "soluble p-selectin," "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type-1" (PAI-1), "Thrombin-Activatable Fibrinolysis Inhibitor" (TAFI), and "Platelet Factor 4" (PF4) in patients with lacunar infarct and compared these values to those of control individuals. There were significant differences for D-dimer, mean platelet volume, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and platelet factor 4 values in symptomatic lacunar stroke group compared with the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Different hemostatic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of lacunar stroke. Evaluating the role of hemostatic factors on different types of strokes may help us identify new therapeutic strategies and different prognostic stratifications for ischemic stroke.
