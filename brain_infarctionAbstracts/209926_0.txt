In seven patients surgical correction of kinking with stenosis of the extracranial part of the carotid artery was performed. The indications for surgical treatment of carotid kinking are discussed in detail. The following criteria for surgical correction are applied: 1. symptoms of cerebral ischemia must be present; 2. position or motion of head and neck can provoke symptoms; 3. definite stenosis of the corresponding carotid artery at the level of kinking; 4. no other causes of cerebral ischemia; 5. no irreversible brain infarction. A simple and effective surgical procedure as a routine method for correction of carotid kinking is described. Only in special circumstances a more extensive open arterial reconstruction might be necessary.
