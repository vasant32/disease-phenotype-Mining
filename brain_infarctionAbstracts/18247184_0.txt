INTRODUCTION: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening iatrogenic condition that may appear following ovulation induction in the course of some fertility treatments. This may lead to further complications, some of which may be severe, such as thromboembolic events. Though rarely, it can therefore be a potential cause of stroke. CLINICAL CASE: We report the case of a 34-year old woman under ovulation induction treatment who developed retinal and brain infarctions secondary to internal carotid occlusion. Oral anticoagulation was administered and recovery was good in spite of the persistence of carotid occlusion in follow-up magnetic ressonance imaging- angiographies. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case of carotid occlusion following an OHSS reported in Spain and the eighth one published in the literature. Current literature on cerebrovascular complications in OHSS is also briefly reviewed.
