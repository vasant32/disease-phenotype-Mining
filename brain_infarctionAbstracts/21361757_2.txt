 OBJECT: The interhemispheric transcallosal approach offers an excellent surgical corridor for the treatment of deep-seated midline lesions. The approach typically requires the sacrifice of one or more middle-third superior sagittal sinus (SSS) cortical bridging veins, which introduces the risk of venous infarction and associated neurological injury. The authors studied the incidence of venous infarcts following this operative approach in a pediatric population. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective review of surgical cases involving pediatric patients treated at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles between 1990 and 2007, in which an interhemispheric transcallosal operative procedure was performed and one or more middle-third SSS cortical bridging veins were occluded. Postoperative MR imaging studies done 1-3 days following the procedure were analyzed and compared with preoperative studies. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. No patient developed MR imaging evidence of venous infarction. CONCLUSIONS: The occlusion of one or more middle-third SSS cortical bridging veins related to the interhemispheric transcallosal approach resulted in no incidence of cerebral venous infarction in this pediatric population.
