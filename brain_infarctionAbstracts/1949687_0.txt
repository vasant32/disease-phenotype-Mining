Content of 5-, 8-, 11-, 12- and 15-monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids was markedly increased in blood of patients with cerebral atherosclerosis accompanied by discirculatory encephalopathy and brain infarction. These values were lower in the patients with infarction as compared with healthy people. After tourniquet ischemia of limbs concentration of the eicosatetraenoic acids was altered in blood of patients: in one group the concentration of all the lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid was increased, in the other group of patients it was decreased. Development of atherosclerosis appears to be related to activation of lipoxygenases and production of monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids.
