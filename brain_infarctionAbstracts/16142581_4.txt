OBJECTIVE: To examine whether intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment given in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke has a favourable effect on cognitive and functional outcome at six months post-stroke. METHODS: The present study included 92 patients with a first-ever symptomatic infarct, of whom 25 (27%) were subjected to rt-PA treatment in the first three hours post-stroke. Multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for stroke severity, education, age, and sex were performed to examine whether rt-PA treatment influenced cognitive outcome (assessed with a neuropsychological examination covering 7 cognitive domains), basic ADL independence (modified Barthel Index > or = 19), and instrumental ADL independence (Frenchay Activities Index > or = 15) after six months. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for intact cognition was 1.0 (95% CI 0.2 to 4.3), that for basic ADL outcome 13.5 (95 % CI 1.4 to 129.4) and for instrumental ADL 7.1 (95 % CI 1.2 to 42.2). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that rt-PA treatment is associated with a favourable basic and instrumental ADL outcome, but not with a beneficial cognitive outcome after 6 months.
