All attempts to reduce neuronal damage after acute brain ischemia by the use of neuroprotective compounds have failed to prove efficacy in clinical trials so far. One of the main reasons might be the relatively narrow time window for intervention. In this study 2 different tissue culture models of ischemia, excitotoxic lesion by the use of glutamate and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), were used to investigate the effects of delayed application of Cerebrolysin (Cere) on neuronal survival. This drug consists of low molecular weight peptides with neuroprotective and neurotrophic properties similar to naturally occurring growth factors. After both types of lesion, acute as well as delayed treatment with Cere resulted in a dose dependent and significant rescue of neurons. In the model of excitotoxic cell death significant drug effects were found even when the treatment started with a delay of 96 hours after addition of glutamate. In the OGD model pronounced effects were found after 48 hours delay of treatment, and even after 72 hours a small but significant rescue of neurons was detected. The neuroprotective effects of a single addition of Cerebrolysin to the culture medium resulted in significant protection until end of the experiments which was up to 2 weeks after the initial lesion. A shift of the efficacious dosages from low to high concentrations indicates that most likely active compounds are used up, indicating that multiple dosing might even increase the effect size. In conclusion the results indicate that Cere displays a relatively wide therapeutic time window which might be explained by a combination of acute neuroprotective properties and neurotrophic efficacy.
