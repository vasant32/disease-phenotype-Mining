A 56-year-old woman with adult idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) diagnosed 17 years previously presented with a fusiform aneurysm manifesting as chronic headache. She had suffered no major hemorrhagic complications, although her platelet counts were between 3.0 x 10(9)/l and 50.0 x 10(9)/l. Magnetic resonance angiography identified a fusiform aneurysm of the right vertebral artery. Endovascular trapping after high-dose gammaglobulin with steroid therapy was performed. The patient received antiplatelet therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. The parent artery and aneurysm were completely occluded with no hemorrhagic complications. Endovascular treatment is considered safe in patients with ITP, although careful periprocedural management of platelet count is required.
