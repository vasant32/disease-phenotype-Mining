Under certain pathological conditions such as cerebral ischemia and reperfusion the occurrence of free radicals is remarkably increased. However, only very little information is available on their quantitative relevance for the pathophysiology and final outcome of diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of oxygen radicals in the pathogenesis of a stroke. For this purpose a rat model for stroke was used. Two of three vitamin E deficient groups were repleted with different dosages of DL-alpha-tocopherylacetate. No signs of vitamin E deficiency could be observed. However, the weight gain during repletion was increased in the vitamin E repleted groups. Brain infarction was created by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for two hours. After 24 hours the measurements of infarct volumes were taken. The infarct volume of the group with the highest repletion dosage was significantly reduced by 81%. This was also expressed in a higher rate of gait disturbances after MCAO of the deficient animals. The control of vitamin E status exhibited a similar repletion-dependent level in plasma and brain. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the generation of oxygen radicals occurring during reperfusion is an important aspect of the pathophysiological mechanism in brain infarction.
