OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: Early use of parenteral antihypertensive drugs is recommended in acute ischemic stroke patients suffering hypertensive emergencies. Calcium antagonist has been widely employed, although there is controversy as to whether calcium antagonist can be administered safely to patients with intracranial hypertension. In a rat model of transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, we evaluated the effect of the calcium antagonist, nicardipine, on intracranial pressure (ICP). Using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), focal cerebral ischemia was induced by an intraluminal thread method. ICP was monitored continuously employing an intraparenchymal catheter. The mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was reduced by infusing nicardipine intravenously. RESULTS: Following 6 hours of transient ischemia and reperfusion, MABP was decreased by about 10 or 20% as compared to the baseline MABP with low-dose or high-dose nicardipine administration, respectively. ICP was significantly increased following reperfusion, although it did not increase further with nicardipine infusion. CONCLUSION: Under conditions where ICP was high following reperfusion, nicardipine reduced blood pressure safely without increasing ICP in rats.
