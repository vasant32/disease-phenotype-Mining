We retrospectively studied 1200 hospitalized acute strokes of all etiologies between July 1990 and August 1992. Ninety-six % of all strokes underwent computed tomography of the head. Fifty-eight percent of the 1200 strokes were brain infarction, 32% brain hemorrhage, 6% subarachnoid hemorrhage and 4% were other stroke subtypes. Thirty (2.5%) of all strokes suffered from early seizures. The incidences of early seizures were 2.8% in brain hemorrhage, 2.3% in brain infarction, 2.7% in subarachnoid hemorrhage and 2% in other stroke subtypes. Early seizures were documented in 6% of the patients with carotid territory cortical infarctions and 12% of the patients with lobar hemorrhage, whereas only 0.6% of the patients without carotid territory cortical infarctions and 0.6% of the patients without lobar hemorrhage were affected. Sixty-six percent of 30 early seizures were partial seizures, 24% generalized and status epilepticus were seen only in 10%. In conclusion, we found the early seizure incidence was 2.5% in Chinese patients hospitalized with acute strokes. There was no correlation between seizure occurrence and stroke subtypes. Early seizure developed significantly higher in acute stroke patients with lesions of the cortex than those patients without cortical involvement. The partial seizures were the most frequent type occurring in 66% of all acute stroke patients with early seizures.
