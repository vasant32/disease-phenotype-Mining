N-myc downstream regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) was reported to be widely expressed in the nervous system. However, the expression and potential role of NDRG2 in focal cerebral ischemia brain remain unclear. Herein, we investigated spatial-temporal expression of NDRG2 in the rat brain following transient focal cerebral ischemia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 120-min transient occlusion of middle cerebral artery. Rats were killed and brain samples were harvested at 4, 12, 24, and 72h after reperfusion. Expression of NDRG2 in the brain was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Cellular apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL staining. The results showed that NDRG2 was expressed on cells with an astrocytes-like morphology in ischemic penumbra. NDRG2 mRNA and protein expression began to increase at 4h after reperfusion and peaked at 24h in the ischemic penumbra. By using immunofluorescence, NDRG2 signals were co-localized with GFAP-positive astrocytes, and NDRG2 expression in astrocytes translocated from a cytoplasm to a nuclear localization at 24h after reperfusion. Double immunofluorescent staining for TUNEL and NDRG2 showed that some NDRG2 signals co-localized with TUNEL-positive cells, and that the apoptotic cells increased with enhancement of NDRG2-positive signals. In conclusion, NDRG2 expression is up-regulated in ischemic penumbra following transient focal cerebral ischemia. NDRG2 expression in astrocytes may play important pathological roles in cell apoptosis after stroke.
