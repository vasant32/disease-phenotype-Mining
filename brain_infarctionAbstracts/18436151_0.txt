BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) constitutes a valuable tool in patients with stroke and cardiac embolization, but its indication is controversial in lacunar stroke. The purpose of this study was to assess the findings of TEE in lacunar stroke. METHODS: Initial symptoms, brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and TEE were performed for all patients with ischemic stroke admitted consecutively to our department of neurology. The subtype of ischemic stroke (lacunar v large-vessel stroke) was also reviewed. RESULTS: In all, 124 patients with ischemic stroke were identified and lacunar syndrome occurred in 46. Major risk factor of embolization in patients with lacunar stroke and indication for anticoagulation were detected in 20% (9 of 46). We compared findings in both groups (lacunar v nonlacunar stroke) to evaluate the differences in the presence of major risk factor for embolization, Chi square = 0.07, P = .8 (odds ratio 95% CI = 0.35-2.18). Characteristics of the 9 patients with lacunar stroke and major risk of embolization show that history of lacunar ischemic stroke was present in all the patients of this group. DISCUSSION: The results of the study suggest that TEE may be necessary to obtain a complete evaluation to optimize preventive treatment in patients with clinical and radiologic presentation that suggest lacunar infarct, particularly in cases with a history of ischemic stroke, in which a potential cardiac source of embolization may be detected.
