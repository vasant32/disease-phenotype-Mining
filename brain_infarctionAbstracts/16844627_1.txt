BACKGROUND: Aprotinin is a serine protease inhibitor, which is usually used during cardiac surgery to reduce blood loss. There is evidence that aprotinin has neuroprotective effects during ischemia. We planned this study to evaluate its potential neuroprotective efficacy during hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). METHODS: Twenty piglets with a median weight of 25.7 kg (interquartile range, 23.9-26.6) were randomly assigned to receive aprotinin or placebo prior to a 75-minute period of HCA at 18 degrees C. Brain microdialysis parameters and neurological and histological scores were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: Changes in brain metabolic parameters and histopathological findings were favorable in the aprotinin group. Brain lactate concentrations were significantly lower in the aprotinin group during the experiment (P = .02) along with blood lactate concentrations in the aprotinin group (P = .023). Brain glucose was significantly higher during the experiment (P = 0.02). Intracranial pressure tended to be higher in the control group. Two of 10 animals in the aprotinin group and 4 of 10 in the control group failed to reach full recovery on the seventh postoperative day. Four animals of 10 in the aprotinin group and 6 animals of 10 in the control group had brain infarction (P = .40). CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest that aprotinin mitigates cerebral damage and improves neurological outcome following a period of HCA.
