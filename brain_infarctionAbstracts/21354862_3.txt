Toll-like receptors are innate immunity receptors that activate inflammation and adaptive immunity. Our objectives were to analyze the association between TLR3, 7, 8 and 9 expressions and clinical outcome in patients with ischemic stroke and the expression of inflammatory molecules. One hundred-ten patients with ischemic stroke were included within 12h of symptoms onset. Stroke severity was evaluated by the NIHSS, and functional outcome was assessed at 3 months by the modified Rankin Scale. Infarct volume at 4-7 days was measured on Computed Tomography imaging. TLR7 and TLR8 at different time points were independently associated with poor outcome. TLR8 was also correlated with infarct volumes. Furthermore, TLR7 and TLR8 on admission were correlated with levels of IL6 and IL1Î² at 24h, 72 h and 7 days. In conclusion, TLR 7 and TLR8 expressions are associated with poor outcome and greater inflammatory response in acute ischemic stroke.
