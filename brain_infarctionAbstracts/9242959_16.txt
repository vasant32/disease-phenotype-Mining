The relationship between cerebrovascular disease and an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in intron 16 of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is still being debated. We examined its role as a risk factor in patients with thrombotic brain infarction. The association between ACE polymorphism and ischemic stroke was examined in 181 patients with thrombotic brain infarction and 271 controls without strokes. The I/D polymorphism was examined using the polymerase chain reaction. Distributions of the ACE genotypes and alleles did not differ between the infarcted patients and the controls. Both distributions in patients with onset at age 60 years or younger were significantly higher than those in younger controls (genotype: chi 2 = 7.6, P = 0.02; allele: chi 2 = 5.6, P = 0.02). There were no significant differences in the distributions of ACE genotypes and alleles between the patients with lacunar infarcts and with cortical infarcts in all ages. There were also significant differences in the distribution of ACE genotypes and alleles between the younger and the elderly subgroup of patients with brain infarction (genotype: chi 2 = 12.9, P = 0.002; allele: chi 2 = 11.1, P = 0.0009). Furthermore, there was a significant decline in the frequency of the ACE D allele with increasing age in all patients with thrombotic brain infarction. These observations demonstrated a significant association between the ACE gene polymorphism and thrombotic brain infarction in patients age 60 years or younger in a Japanese population. Furthermore, there may be an association between the ACE D allele and mortality after cerebral infarction.
