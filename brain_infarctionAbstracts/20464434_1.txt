 BACKGROUND: A bursting cascade of inflammation imposes progressive neurological deterioration after experimental stroke has been demonstrated. In our study, 6-mercaptopurine (6-mp) has been successful in alleviating cerebral infarct in a rodent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model. The present study was aimed to examine the effect of 6-mp on cytokine levels in experimental stroke. METHODS: The rodent pMCAO model was employed. A dose of 2 mg/kg 6-mp or vehicle (0.1 mol/L PBS) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min after the induction of pMCAO. Neurological score, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha and infarct volume were determined 48 h after pMCAO. RESULTS: Cerebral infarction volume was significantly decreased in animals treated with 6-mp (74.3%, p < 0.01), and the ratio of tissue edema was also decreased in 6-mp-treated groups (71%). Animals receiving 6-mp thus showed a significant decrease in IL-1 and TNF-alpha (18/43% and 48/64% in CSF/serum, respectively) when compared with the pMCAO groups (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that 6-mp interposes the production of IL-1 and TNF-alpha in CSF and serum, attenuates ischemic brain injury, and thus alleviates neurological deficits in the pMCAO animals. These findings also offer first evidence that 6-mp may attenuate TNF-alpha-related neuron apoptosis and also support the notion that 6-mp and other anti-inflammatory agents could potentially have therapeutic uses in cases of cerebral infarct.
