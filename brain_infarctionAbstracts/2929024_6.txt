We investigated the relation of plasma lipids to the risk for ischemic stroke by comparing clinical and biochemical characteristics of survivors of cortical (n = 48) and lacunar (n = 36) brain infarction. By analysis of variance, no differences were observed in the concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or apoproteins A1 and B. Patients with lacunar infarction, however, had higher concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol than patients with cortical stroke. This HDL-cholesterol difference was due primarily to a strikingly low HDL-cholesterol content in white patients with cortical stroke. These data suggest that previously demonstrated differences in HDL-cholesterol concentrations between patients with ischemic stroke and control subjects without stroke may apply to patients with cortical but not lacunar infarction. Separation of cerebral infarction into subtypes based on mechanism may help clarify lipid-related risk factors in cerebrovascular disease.
