PURPOSE: To investigate sodium magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for monitoring tissue viability in stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive MR imaging protocol used to measure apparent diffusion coefficient and perfusion parameters was extended to include sodium imaging. Tissue sodium concentration was estimated by using a two-compartment model. This protocol lasted less than 45 minutes. These parameters were followed over the first 6 hours in a nonhuman primate model (n = 2) of acute embolic stroke without or with thrombolytic therapy. This protocol was used in patients in whom acute (< 24 hours, n = 11) or nonacute (> or = 24 hours, n = 31) stroke was ultimately confirmed. RESULTS: The animal model showed abnormal diffusion and perfusion parameters in the lesion immediately after embolization, and these remained abnormal for over 6 hours. Tissue sodium concentration increased with time (5.7 mmol/L/h) unless halted with thrombolytic therapy. Regions with sodium concentrations over 70 mmol/L were histochemically verified as being infarcted. In patients in whom stroke older than 6 hours was clinically confirmed, sodium concentrations over 70 mmol/L were found in the appropriate brain regions. CONCLUSION: Tissue sodium concentration provides a sensitive measure of tissue viability that is complementary to the diagnostic role of diffusion and perfusion imaging for ischemic insult.
