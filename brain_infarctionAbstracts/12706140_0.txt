A 41-year-old woman was admitted in the 8th pregnancy week as a consequence of a left-sided media infarction. After alloprothetic aortic valve replacement, she had discontinued deliberately the mandatory anticoagulation treatment. Following an initial clinical stabilisation, a second insult with right-sided media total infarction occurred 3 weeks after admission. In the further course, she developed an apallic syndrome and required respirator therapy. The initial enteral nutrition therapy via naso-gastric tube, was continued via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Due to recurrent vomiting from the 24th pregnancy week, the PEG was changed into a PEG with jejunal position of the tube (JET-PEG). Via this access and simultaneous body impedance analysis (BIA) control, the further nutrition therapy could be continued uneventfully. In the 27th pregnancy week, the patient gave birth to a female newborn (birth weight: 820 g) by Caesarean section in pre-eclampsia. The foetal development was in accordance with the gestational period and uncomplicated in the further course. The mother could be released into ambulatory care where the above nutrition therapy was continued. Reports on a successful nutrition therapy of pregnant comatose patients are rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case where JET-PEG and monitoring by repeated BIA measurement were used for the control of the enteral nutrition.
