Ten cases were treated with systematic administration of mannitol followed by the blood substitute, perfluorochemicals, in the acute period of cerebral infarction in order to suppress the development of infarction and progressive deterioration. This chemotherapy was followed by reconstructive vascular surgery. There were 8 cases of cerebral infarction and 2 other cases in which cerebral vascular occlusion occurred during surgery. Due to this treatment, there were no cases of aggravated condition or death and at the time of follow-up examination after 2 months, and 8 of the ten patients returned to productive lives. We consequently believe that this therapeutic method may prove to be the effective means for treating cerebral infarction in the acute period. It is also thought that this method is applicable in surgical cases where long-term vascular occlusion is required.
