The aim of the present study was to elucidate the contribution of the superior and posterior inferior cerebellum to adaptive improvement and aftereffects in a visuomotor adaptation task. Nine patients with ischemic lesions within the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), six patients with ischemic lesions within the territory of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) and 17 age-matched controls participated. All subjects performed center-out reaching movements under 60 degrees rotation of visual feedback. For the assessment of aftereffects, we tested retention of adaptation and de-adaptation under 0 degrees visual rotation. From this data we also quantified five measures of motor performance. Cerebellar lesion-symptom mapping was performed using magnetic resonance imaging subtraction analysis. Adaptive improvement during 60 degrees rotation was significantly degraded in PICA patients and even more in SCA patients. Subtraction analysis revealed that posterior (Crus I) as well as anterior cerebellar regions (lobule V) showed a common overlap related to deficits in adaptive improvement. However, for aftereffect measures as well as for motor performance variables only SCA patients, but not PICA patients showed significant differences to control subjects. Subtraction analysis showed that affection of lobules V and VI were more common in patients with impaired retention and de-adaptation, respectively. Data shows that areas both within the superior and posterior inferior cerebellum are involved in adaptive improvement. However, only the superior cerebellum including lobules V and VI appears to be important for aftereffects and therefore true adaptive ability.
