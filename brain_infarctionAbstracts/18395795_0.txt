OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported the optimized methods for the detection of elastin derived peptides (EDP) in the serum, synovial fluid, and bronchoalveolar lavage. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether EDP are detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with acute brain ischaemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven first ever ischaemic stroke patients (mean age 61.5+/-10.8 years; age range 47-70 years; 12 women) were studied in acute phase (1-15 days after the onset) with clinical evaluations, radiological assessments, and the analysis of serum and CSF based on Western blot and ELISA for the detection and quantification of EDP. RESULTS: None of the serum EDP concentrations are significantly higher in stroke patients compared with 25 healthy control individuals. However, EDP levels in CSF are strongly (p<0.0001) elevated compared with healthy subjects. They correlated with total cholesterol (r=0.53; p=0.02), triglycerides (r=0.67; p=0.004) and retinopathy (r=0.24; p=0.03), and with the interval between the stroke onset and the time of lumbar puncture (r=0.35; p=0.02). CONCLUSION: EDPs are detectable in CSF of healthy subjects and patients with ischaemic stroke. Acute brain infarction is followed by increased levels of EDP in CSF.
