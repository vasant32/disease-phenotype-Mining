The adenylate kinase (AK) enzyme activity in plasma and CSF of acute brain infarctions was examined. The normal values of enzyme activity in plasma reached from 1.7-5.6 U/l, and in CSF from 0.23-0.71 U/l. According to this present classification a significant CSF increase in AK activity was found with semi-severe and severe brain infarctions. With the CCT an increased enzyme activity was shown with infarction in or close to the cortex. In no case was an alteration of AK activity in the serum sample. CSF samples showing blood contamination or pleocytosis led to false pathological results with examination of AK activity.
