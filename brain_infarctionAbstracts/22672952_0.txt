The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the recovery of gross motor function and cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) capacity measured by brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients with first-ever supratentorial infarction. Gross motor function was assessed according to the locomotor and mobility subset of the functional independence measure. The CVR was measured as the difference in the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after acetazolamide (ACZ)-challenged(99m)Tc-ECD perfusion SPECT from baseline rCBF. All 22 hemiplegic patients (mean age, 60.97 years) enrolled were admitted at a mean of 20.86 days from onset and received rehabilitation care for an average of 38.82 days. The recovery of gross motor function was significantly correlated with baseline rCBF and CVR of ACZ-SPECT in the areas of affected supratentorial hemisphere (r=0.447 and r=0.444, respectively, p < 0.05). Analysis of the linear regression model, adjusted for time to SPECT testing, revealed that the CVR in the affected supratentorial hemisphere was a significant predictor of the gross motor outcome (p< 0.05). In conclusion, the CVR of the affected supratentorial hemisphere may be employed along with other parameters to predict the gross motor recovery of patients with subacute infarction.
