BACKGROUND: Hydranencephaly is the total or near-total destruction of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. The thalami and lower brain centers are typically preserved. This condition is usually preceded by occlusion of the internal carotid arteries, resulting in massive brain infarction. CASE: An 18-year-old woman, gravida 1, presented with a 1-day history of heavy vaginal bleeding at 23 weeks' gestation. Initial ultrasound revealed oligohydramnios and retroplacental lucency consistent with placental abruption. A follow-up level II ultrasound revealed abnormal intracerebral architecture. Subsequent ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an evolving case of hydranencephaly. Postdelivery computed tomography verified the prenatal findings. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound and MRI are useful radiologic studies to confirm the diagnosis of hydranencephaly.
