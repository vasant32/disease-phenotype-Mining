Many practical therapies have been explored as clinical applications for ischemic cerebral infarction; however, most are still insufficient to treat acute stroke. We show here a potential combination therapy in a rat focal ischemic model to improve neurological symptoms as well as to reduce infarct volumes at the maximum level. We applied protein transduction technology using artificial anti-death Bcl-xl derivative with three amino acid-substitutions (Y22F, Q26N and R165K) (FNK) protein fused with a protein-transduction-domain peptide (PTD-FNK). When PTD-FNK was administrated 1 h after initiating ischemia followed by the administration of an immunosuppressant FK506 with a 30-min time lag, infarct volumes of the total brain and cortex were markedly reduced to 27% and 14%, respectively. This procedure not only reduced the infarct volume and edema, but also markedly improved neurological symptoms. The therapeutic effect continued for at least 1 week after ischemia. FK506 inhibited the transduction of PTD-FNK in vitro, which explains the requirement of a time lag for the administration of FK506. An additional in vitro experiment showed that PTD-FNK, when administered 30 min before FK506, gave the maximal protective effect by reducing the intracellular calcium concentration. We propose that this combination therapy would provide a synergistic protective effect by both drugs, reducing adverse the effects of FK506.
