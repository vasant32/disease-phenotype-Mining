Ischemic stroke following snake bite is rare. We report an 18-year male who developed right hemiplegia with expressive aphasia following a Russell's viper bite. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging revealed infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory. The possible mechanisms for cerebral infarction in this scenario include disseminated intravascular coagulation, toxin induced vasculitis and endothelial damage.
