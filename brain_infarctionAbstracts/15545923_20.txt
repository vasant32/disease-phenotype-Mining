Cathepsins and caspases are two families of proteases that play pivotal roles in ischemic cell death. This study investigated the existence of a cross-talk between cathepsin B and proinflammatory caspases in stroke-induced cell death, as recently suggested by in vitro data. Cortical ischemic damage was induced in mice by distal and permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Cytoplasmic activation of cathepsin B was observed from the early stages of infarction, and displayed an activation pattern parallel to the activation pattern of caspase-1 and -11. Immunohistochemistry revealed the colocalization of cathepsin B with each caspase in cells of the infarct core. The apical position of cathepsin B in both caspase-activation cascades was confirmed by pretreatment of the animals with the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074, which also potently protected cortical structures from ischemic damage, indicating involvement of the proteases in the lesion process. The results show that cathepsin B release is an early event following occlusion of cerebral arteries, which eventually triggers the activation of proinflammatory caspases in the absence of reperfusion. This new pathway may play a critical role in brain infarction by promoting inflammatory responses, and/or by amplifying the apoptotic process.
