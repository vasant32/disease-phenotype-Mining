One hundred and six elderly patients with chronic stroke who were admitted to Seiai Rehabilitation Hospital were studied regarding urinary incontinence. The average age of the subjects was 74 +/- 8 years old, ranging from 60 to 94 years. Seventy three of the 106 patients (69%) had urinary incontinence which was found in 72% of brain infarction, 61% of brain hemorrhage and 67% of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The prevalence of urinary incontinence in cases of brain stem, thalamic, and putaminal hemorrhage was 80%, 67% and 46%, while that in cases of cortical infarction and infarct of perforating arteries was 84% and 68%, respectively. The rate of urinary incontinence was significantly higher in those aged 75 years or over (p < 0.05), those with poor activities of daily living (ADL, p < 0.005), or with dementia (p < 0.001). Dementia was a complicating factor more frequently in aged patients (p < 0.05) and in those with poor ADL (p < 0.001), although no correlation was seen between age and ADL (p = 0.08). These results indicated the high prevalence of urinary incontinence in elderly inpatients with chronic stroke, which is significantly related to impairment of mental and physical activities.
