MRI of subjects with silent intracranial damages may provide more evidence than CT. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence of silent MRI lesions in patients with coronary artery disease. The study included 72 consecutive patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease and 26 age and sex matched controls with normal coronary angiography. All subjects were evaluated for coronary atherosclerosis (Gensini and coronary angiography scores), the number of silent cerebral lesions detected by MRI, carotid stenosis and the risk factors for stroke. Thirty one of 72 (43.0%) patients had silent brain lesions on MRI while 8 of 26 (30.7%) control subjects showed silent brain infarction. The main finding on T2-weighted MRI was white matter hyperintensities (WMH) which were seen in all patients with silent brain lesions. The mean age of the patients with coronary artery disease and with silent cerebral lesions was significantly higher than that of patients without silent brain lesions. The Gensini score, coronary angiography score and prevalence of carotid stenosis are significantly higher in patients with silent cerebral lesions than that of patients without silent cerebral lesions. There was no significant difference between silent cerebral lesions and the other risk factors for stroke. Silent brain lesions are a common complication in patients with coronary artery disease. In patients with coronary artery disease, carotid artery stenosis and age were important risk factors for the development of silent brain infarction.
