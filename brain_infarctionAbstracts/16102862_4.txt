To compare neuroprotective effects of lidocaine and procaine against ischemic insult, intracellular recordings were made from rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in slice preparations. Superfusion of the slices with oxygen- and glucose-deprived medium (in vitro ischemia) produced a rapid depolarization 6 min from the onset. When oxygen and glucose were reintroduced, the membrane depolarized further until it reached 0 mV, and thereafter the membrane showed no functional recovery. Pretreatment with lidocaine (10 microM), but not procaine (50 microM), restored the membrane potential after the reintroduction of oxygen and glucose. Lidocaine, compared to procaine, significantly inhibited the reduction in both tissue ATP content and flavoprotein fluorescence during and after in vitro ischemia. Under electron microscopy, only lidocaine well preserved the structure of mitochondria in the CA1 pyramidal cell body. Extracellular recordings revealed that procaine reduced the field postsynaptic potential whereas lidocaine augmented it. Both drugs reduced the presynaptic volley dose-dependently. Neither lidocaine nor procaine significantly affected a rapid rise of the intracellular Ca2+ level produced by in vitro ischemia in the CA1 region. All the results suggest that the neuroprotective lidocaine action is due to the protection of the mitochondria to maintain the tissue ATP content during and after in vitro ischemia.
