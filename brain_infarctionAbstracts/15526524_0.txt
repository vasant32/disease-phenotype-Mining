Hyperhomocysteinemia is thought to have an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic cerebral infarction. When associated with diabetes mellitus, it might worsen the neurologic course. The aim of the study was to clarify the relation between plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations and silent brain infarction (SBI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Total plasma Hcy levels were prospectively studied in 46 patients with type 2 diabetes and SBI (group I), mean age 56+/-5.4 years, as compared to 38 diabetic patients without SBI (group II) and with 31 controls (group III). Homocysteine concentrations were determined using a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The results were compared using the Student's t test. The mean level of Hcy was 22.6+/-2.4 micromol/l in group I, 19.7+/-1.6 micromol/l in group II and 11.4+/-1.4 micromol/l in group III; between group I and group II p < or = 0.001. These data are consistent with increased Hcy levels in type 2 diabetic patients, contributing to the onset of SBI in some patients. The phenomenon should be considered in any future strategy for the therapy of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (HHcy).
