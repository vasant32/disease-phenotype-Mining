Peliosis is a rarely seen histological finding with unexplained fully etiology and pathogenesis. It is presented as cyst-like blood filled cavities. The presence of peliosis in the endocrine part of the pancreas is extremely rarely reported microscopic phenomenon. The authors provide histological, histochemical, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural investigation of microscopic peliosis in the pancreas from an autopsy case with thrombotic trombocytopenic purpura. The findings give ideas for a wide range of pathophysiological and morphogenetic comments of such an unusual morphologic presentation.
