Between January 1978 and December 1979 23 consecutive patients aged under 40 years with acute ischemic brain infarction were admitted to the department of neurology, Meilahti University Hospital in Helsinki. In 10 patients (43%) the onset of symptoms was preceded within 24 hours by ethanol intoxication, and all but one symptom occurred at weekends when most liquor is consumed in Finland. Ethanol intoxication preceding the stroke was 4 times as common in female and 5 times as common in male patients as ethanol intoxication in the general Finnish population of the same age and sex. The present results support those of our previous study and suggest that occasional ethanol intoxication increases the risk of ischemic brain infarction both in adolescents and young adults.
