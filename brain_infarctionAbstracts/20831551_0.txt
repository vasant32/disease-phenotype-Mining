Extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) was initiated at the recommended maximum dose 800 mg and maintained at the same dose in five patients with schizophrenia. Although the loadings of quetiapine XR were well tolerated in four patients in these five cases, one patient with a history of cerebral infarction developed serious side-effects, notably bladder distention and dizziness. This case series indicates that loading with maximum dose quetiapine XR may be tolerable and used safely in most schizophrenia patients with no other concurrent disease such as brain infarction.
