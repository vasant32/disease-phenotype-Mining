 BACKGROUND: We have recently found that the median relative risk value (RRV) (0-1) of brain infarction estimated by protein-conjugated acrolein (PC-Acro), IL-6 and CRP together with age was in the order silent brain infarction (SBI) (0.80)>carotid atherosclerosis (CA) (0.76)>white matter hyperintensity (WMH) (0.46)>control (0.14). We clarified how metabolic disorders [hypertension (HT), hyperlipidemia (HL) and hyperglycemia (HG)] are correlated with RRV. METHODS: The levels of PC-Acro, IL-6 and CRP in plasma were measured by ELISA. SBI and WMH were evaluated by MRI, and CA was evaluated by duplex carotid ultrasonography. RESULTS: The median RRV of metabolic disorders was in the order HT+HG (0.84)>HT+HL (0.73)>HT (0.65)≈HG (0.65)>HL (0.61)>HL+HG (0.48)>no metabolic disorder (0.24)>normal (0.11). Correlation with SBI was in the order HT+HG (52%)>HT+HL (42%)>HT (40%)>HG (34%)≈HL(33%)>HL+HG (14%)≈no metabolic disorder (14%). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that HT is the most strongly associated factor with SBI among metabolic disorders and that the seriousness of metabolic disorder estimated by RRV was well correlated with SBI.
