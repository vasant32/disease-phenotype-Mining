We report a young woman suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by severe thrombocytopenia and high-level antiphospholipid antibodies. Thrombocytopenia was refractory to any therapy. In the course of the illness the patient developed an ischemic cerebrovascular stroke. We discuss the clinical features of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome being primarily characterized by recurrent thromboembolism and address the appropriate prophylactic measures to avoid recurrent events.
