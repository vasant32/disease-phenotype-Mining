A 4-year-old boy developed progressive neck pain and an expansile osteogenic lesion of C2; the diagnosis was an aneurysmal bone cyst. An image-guided biopsy with 3D CT planning was performed followed by Ethibloc injection into the aneurysmal bone cyst. Subsequent CT and MR images demonstrated embolization material in the vertebrobasilar system, and the patient died of brain stem and cerebellar infarction 23 hours after the intervention. The course of events and technical considerations are discussed.
