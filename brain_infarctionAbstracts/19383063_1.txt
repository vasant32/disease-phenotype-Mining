BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between total plasma homocysteine, cholesterol levels, vitamin B(12), folate, thyroid hormones, urea, ferritin, uric acid, C-reactive protein, cardiovascular risk factors and silent brain infarct (SBI) in patients without any neurological disorder. Whether the factors of interest were associated with SBI is investigated. METHODS: One hundred and forty-two subjects with a mean age of 52.1 +/- 13.1 years (21-87 years) without any history of stroke, transient ischaemic attack and neurological abnormality were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and blood chemistry determinations. Student's t-test was used to compare differences in means of laboratory results between the groups with and without SBI. The chi(2)-test was used for categorized variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictors of SBI. RESULTS: The group comprised 56 men and 86 women. SBI were found in 40 patients (28%). The low-density lipoprotein levels were significantly higher in the infarct group (P = 0.019), homocysteine concentrations were significantly higher in the men-infarct group (P = 0,029) and total cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the women-infarct group than the women non-infarct group (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Serum low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol and homocysteine levels were associated with SBI.
