 OBJECTIVE: To analyze the correlative factors of traumatic embolism in superficial cerebral vein and explore their corresponding treatments. METHODS: A total of 74 cases were divided into 3 groups according to their injury mechanisms. Group A: traumatic brain injury in superficial cerebral vein with cerebral contusion, acute intracerebral hematoma and subdural hematoma in the same place; Group B: traumatic brain injury in superficial cerebral vein with acute intracerebral hematoma, subdural hematoma and skull fracture in the same place; Group C: traumatic brain injury in superficial cerebral vein with acute subdural hematoma and skull fracture in the same place, without cerebral contusion or acute intracerebral hematoma. They were divided into different groups according to gender, age, pre-operative GCS and cerebral hernia. RESULTS: Among 74 cases, 28, 39 and 7 cases belonged to groups A, B and C respectively. There was significant difference among injured veins in three groups (P < 0.01). Cerebral infarction was found in 37 cases in groups A and B while only 2 cases in group C. Cerebral infarction had no correlation with sex, age, pre-operative GCS and cerebral hernia. CONCLUSION: Injuries in superficial cerebral vein are mainly caused by skull fracture, contre-coup injury and shearing force. Cerebral infarction often exists if there is cerebral contusion. It is necessary to protect injured primary superficial cerebral veins and ambient venous network, remove intracranial hematoma and large bone flap to reduce intracranial hypertension and dilute blood post-operatively to prevent venous embolism.
