The aim of this work was the determination of apolipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in the patients three months after the onset of ischaemic stroke. A group of 56 patients was investigated. Stroke was diagnosed as caused by atherosclerotic changes in main cerebral arteries in 32 patients and in 11 by changes in cervical arteries. In 13 persons a lacunar stroke was recognised. The mean Lp(a) level and the median value were significantly higher in the group of patients after stroke as compared with 45 controls. A more frequent occurrence of Lp(a) level over 30 mg/dl considered as pathological was observed more often in the patients. No correlation was seen between Lp(a) and the resistance of LDL to oxidation nor between Lp(a) and the amount of products of LDL oxidation in vitro.
