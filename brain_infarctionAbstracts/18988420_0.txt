Post Infarct cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome is a rare disorder, characterized by cognitive impairment in the domains of memory, language, visuo-spatial functioning and affect after cerebellar stroke. We report a case of young female who developed mood alteration and cognitive disturbance following isolated cerebellar infarct. We, therefore, advocate a potential role of cerebellum in regulation of cognition and behaviour in humans.
