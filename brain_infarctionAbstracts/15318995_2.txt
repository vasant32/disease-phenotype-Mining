Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) has been an available operation for weight loss for the past decade, and bariatric surgery is increasing in the United States. Careful patient screening and follow-up have been the cornerstone for success against the complexities of morbid obesity. Neurologic complications have occurred, such as polyneuropathy and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. We report an 18-year-old female with morbid obesity, steatohepatitis, tobacco, recreational drug, and oral contraceptive use who at 4 months after LRYGBP experienced a generalized seizure and stroke. She was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke, possibly venous infarction. Her postoperative course had been complicated by malnutrition and dehydration, apparently related to nausea from chronic cholecystitis. She had a possible protein-S deficiency. Rare neurologic complications emphasize the importance of postoperative surveillance in these patients.
