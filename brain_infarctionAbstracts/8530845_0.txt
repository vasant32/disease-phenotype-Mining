In 42 patients with thoracic aortic disease, a selective cerebral perfusion with 16 degrees C cold blood was applied for the brain protection during the repair of the thoracic aorta. The surgical repair consisted of the replacement of the ascending aorta (9 cases), the ascending aorta and aortic arch (12 cases), the aortic arch (18 cases), and the aortic arch and descending aorta (3 cases). Twenty-two patients of them (52%) required emergency surgery and four patients died due to postoperative complications including visceral organ ischemia (2 cases) and multiple organ failure (2 cases). The mortality rate of this group was 18.2% (4/22 cases). In elective surgical classes, one patient died due to intraoperative coronary embolism. The mortality rate of this group was 5.0% (1/20 cases). No postoperative obvious brain defect was observed except one old patient (85-year-old female) with ruptured aortic arch who already had the brain infarction preoperatively. She died due to multiple organ failure with unconsciousness. Other patients including the patients with long cerebral perfusion (> 180 min) recovered well and returned to normal daily life. The selective cerebral perfusion with cold blood was easy to prepare and demonstrated the superb efficacy of brain protection in the patient.
