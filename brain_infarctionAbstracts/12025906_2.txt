We describe a 66-year-old Japanese man in whom central retinal artery occlusion followed cardiac catheterization. After the procedure, blurred vision was noted in the right eye, and ophthalmological examination revealed an occlusion. Central retinal artery occlusion is a very rare but serious complication of cardiac catheterization. We should anticipate this potential risk to ensure prompt detection and treatment.
