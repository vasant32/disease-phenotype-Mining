Lemierre syndrome is a potentially fatal condition after an oropharyngeal infection. It is characterized by thrombophlebitis of head and neck veins with systemic dissemination of septic emboli. The most frequently isolated pathogen is Fusobacterium necrophorum. We report an unusual case of Lemierre syndrome in a 4-year-old child caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with multivisceral emboli to the brain, orbits, lungs, and heart valves. We also discuss its atypical clinical presentation, the crucial role of imaging in the early diagnosis, and the different treatment modalities of this life-threatening syndrome.
