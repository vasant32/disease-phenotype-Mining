OBJECTIVE: We investigated the predictors of good prognosis in total anterior circulation infarction (TACI), under conventional therapy. METHODS: We enrolled 166 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke within 6 h after onset with symptoms of TACI. Sixty-three patients (38.0%) with good outcome [G group, the modified Rankin Disability Scale (mRS) after 3 months < or =3] and 103 patients (62.0%) with bad outcome (B group, mRS >3) were compared. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, G group patients were significantly younger, had lower score in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of total and consciousness sub-score, had lower rate of clinical deterioration. On cranial CT at entry, three early CT signs [hyperdense middle cerebral artery (MCA) sign, hypodensity of >1/3 MCA and brain swelling] were significantly more frequent in the B group. On the second CT at 24-48 h, infarct area as assessed by the Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS) was significantly smaller in the G group. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression revealed age <7 0 years, NIHSS < or =15, no clinical deterioration, and only no brain swelling in early CT signs, and ASPECTS > or =7 as independent predictors of good prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Some clinical variables are useful in predicting outcome in TACI within the early period after stroke onset.
