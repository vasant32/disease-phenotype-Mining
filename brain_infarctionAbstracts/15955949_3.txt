In addition to etiologies common in the general population, strokes in cancer patients may be caused by hypercoagulable states, hyperviscosity, cardiogenic embolism, and neoplastic vessel infiltration. Intravascular mucins were reported in patients with recurrent thromboembolism. The authors report four patients with metastatic cancer, brain infarcts, and other thromboembolic disease with markedly elevated levels of the tumor marker CA-125 and explore possible associations between this mucinous protein and strokes.
