The authors report a patient of pure apraxic agraphia with normal praxis due to left thalamic infarction. 15O-gas-PET showed reduced oxygen metabolism in the left thalamus and the left dorsolateral premotor area, while MRI and 11C-fulumazenil-PET showed no remarkable lesions in the frontal cortex. The patient's word imaging remained normal. The authors hypothesize that thalamic destruction causes pure apraxic agraphia by exerting a remote effect on left dorsolateral premotor area and blocking somewhere between graphemic area and motor programming.
