A 43-year-old patient was admitted to hospital with an apoplectic stroke caused by an angiographically confirmed partial stenosis of the arteria cerebri media branch. We diagnosed Ménétrier's disease, documented by gastroscopy and histology, after having eliminated other causes for the apoplexy. We suggest a direct causal relationship between the stroke and Ménétrier's disease, since high incidences of thromboembolic complications have been reported in association with this rare disease. After conservative therapy with H2-blockers, laboratory values returned to normal. In the two years following diagnosis, the patient reported no recurrence of neurologic complications.
