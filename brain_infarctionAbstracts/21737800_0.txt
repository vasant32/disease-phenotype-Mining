 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interhemispheric inhibition via the corpus callosum has been proposed as an exacerbating factor in outcome from stroke. METHODS: We measured infarct volume and behavioral outcome after middle cerebral artery occlusion in callosotomized rats and acallosal mice. RESULTS: Neither callosotomy in rats nor callosal agenesis in mice improved infarct volume or behavioral outcome after middle cerebral artery occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings argue against a role for transcallosal projections in exacerbating focal cerebral ischemia.
