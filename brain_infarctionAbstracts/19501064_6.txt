Glutamate receptor-mediated neurotoxicity is a major mechanism contributing to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI). Memantine is a safe non-competitive NMDA receptor blocker characterized by its low affinity and fast unblocking kinetics. Topiramate is an AMPA/KA receptor blocker and use-dependent sodium channel blocker with several other neuroprotective actions and little neurotoxicity. We hypothesized that the coadministration of memantine and topiramate would be highly effective to attenuate HIBI in neonatal rats. Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups were subjected to right common carotid artery ligation and hypoxia for 2 h, and then were randomly and blindly assigned to one of four groups: vehicle, memantine, topiramate and combination group. Brain injury was evaluated by gross damage and weight deficit of the right hemisphere at 22d after hypoxic-ischemia (HI) and by neurofunctional assessment (foot-fault test) at 21d post-HI. Acute neuronal injury was also evaluated by microscopic damage grading at 72 h post-HI. Results showed the combination of memantine and topiramate improved both pathological outcome and performance significantly. The drug-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration was assessed by TUNEL staining at 48 h post-HI and the result showed no elevated apoptosis in all observed areas. The result of the experiment indicates the combination therapy is safe and highly effective to reduce brain damage after HIBI.
