PURPOSE: To establish, using brain spiral computerised tomography (SCT) and modified Barthel index (MBI), whether the location of cerebral infarction could be correlated with functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients who undergo early intensive rehabilitation. METHODS: Observational cohort, assessor blinded and correlational prospective 12-weeks study that included 111 acute ischemic stroke patients, admitted consecutively to an early intensive inpatient rehabilitation programme (5 days a week, 3-5 h a day) during 2003. Confirmation of diagnosis and stratification was done by brain SCT. Brain lesion locations were correlated to motor performance and functional outcome, on admission and discharge, using MBI. RESULTS: Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between motor performance, functional outcome and brain lesion locations. The groups with deep, combined deep and large superficial, small superficial and large superficial infarcts showed the most consistent improvement in that order of frequency. Normal brain SCT group did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.051) while the bi-hemispheric infarcts group did not show any change. The inter and intra group differences were highly significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate non-contrasted brain SCT may act as an independent predictor of final functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke. It may provide clinicians with an opportunity to offer realistic expectations to stroke patients and their relatives.
