A 39 year old woman presented with a short history of bloody diarrhoea. She subsequently developed microangiopathic haemolysis, platelet consumption, and renal impairment. Initial investigations suggested underlying Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum complicated by sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. However, after resection of a perforated caecum and terminal ileum, the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was made. There was weak serological evidence of yersinia infection, this may have caused the early localisation of the lesions to the terminal ileum. This is believed to be the first report of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura affecting the small bowel alone at presentation.
